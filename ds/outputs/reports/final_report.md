# Introduction

In EURITO (EU Relevant, Inclusive and Trusted Indicators) we explored the opportunities and challenges for developing indicators based on novel data sources and data science methods with the goal of informing Research and Innovation (R&I) policy. 

Our starting point was that the data revolution - increasing availability of a high volume of data generated at high velocity and with high variety, and of computational methods and tools to extract insights from it [@mayer2013big] - could generate a more detailed, timely and comprehensive view of the economy and its evolution which is relevant for R&I policymakers. Significant concerns around representativity, transparency and ethics are however standing in the way of their wider adoption [bakhshi2016new]. 

We sought to tackle these issues by following a process that began with a scoping phase where we engaged policymakers to identify gaps in the R&I evidence base and indicator toolkit that could be addressed with new data and methods. We then explored opportunities to address those gaps through data science pilots and scaled up data collection and analysis in those areas that offered greatest promise / feasibility. The resulting indicators were validated qualitatively and quantitatively and distributed through reports and papers, open datasets and interactive visualisations. All our code was made openly available for others to inspect and build on.^[We have released code related to specific papers in individual github repositories. The [Eurito indicators repository](https://www.github.com/nesta_uk/eurito_indicators) contains the code used in the Covid-19 analysis and visualisation frontend.]

This final report describes our activities and outputs throughout the project with a focus on our indicator production methods and results. In those cases where these efforts have resulted in peer-reviewed publications, working papers or EURITO deliverables, we summarise key results and refer the readers to those documents for additional detail. In other cases - particularly the analysis of EU R&I funding data to measure activities related to Sustainable Development Goals, and our analysis of R&I activities related to Covid-19, we provide extensive information about the methods we used to produce and validate indicators.

[@sec:ind1] describes indicator development before Covid-19, This includes our policy scoping activities, the results of our exploratory pilots, our Artificial Intelligence (AI) mapping programme, and our analysis of relatedness to Sustainable Development Goals in a EU R&I funding corpus. 

[@sec:covid] presents the results of our analysis of a programme of research and indicator development about R&I activities related to Covid-19 initiated with the onset of the pandemic. This includes analyses of EU R&I funding data, preprints and peer-reviewed publications and outputs of research projects. 

[@sec:val] describes how we validated our indicators. 

[@sec:outputs] outlines the outputs of the project.

[@sec:org] discusses the organisational implications of our analysis: what activities are required to encourage the adoption of new indicators in the R&I evidence system, and what changes - in terms of capabilities, orgaanisation and culture - are required if R&I agencies are going to realise the value of novel data sources and methods.

[@sec:conclusion] concludes.

# Indicator development before Covid-19 {#sec:ind1}

## Pilot related work and outputs {#subsec:pilots}

In the scoping phase of the project we organised two workshops in Brussels involving representatives from the European Commission, member states and the research community. These workshops were attended by XXX policymakers. Our goal with them was to ensure that our indicator development activities were focused on policy-relevant areas, and to assess which features of R&I indicators might encourage or constrain their adoption. The workshops led to the identification of eight areas for further exploration through data science pilots which we detail below.
