374,108053,No,Abscisic acid and the mechanisms that regulate hydrotropism,"Despite ABA being the most important phytohormone in the response of plants to drought stress little is known about how water deficits are perceived by plants. Although ABA has been traditionally described as a growth inhibitor, different reports have shown a role for ABA promoting growth. Under water stress ABA inhibits shoot growth and maintains root growth in order to guarantee water uptake. In fact, roots grow towards zones with higher water contents and this response is called hydrotropism. This project is focused on the study of the mechanisms that link the perception of water deficits in the soil with the adaptive responses caused by ABA that are directed to ensure plant survival. The identification of the mechanism by which an environmental signal causes a modification of root growth will be investigated. The discovery of the elements responsible for transmitting the water deficit signal and the proteins involved in this signaling pathway will compose the first part of the project. Next, the creation of multiscale models capturing the response integrating dynamic changes in ABA response, biomechanics and root growth in response to hydrotropic stimuli as well as the use of non invasive micro CT imaging of root systems will help to understand how plants respond to osmotic gradients in soil. The study of the mechanisms that regulate root growth and bending will help create useful tools directed to reduce crop losses caused by this stress. The experience of the researcher in the field of ABA will help to create an integrative point of view of the role of this hormone in the context of growth regulation. The availability of modeling, genetic and imaging techniques as well as the long experience of Prof. Malcolm Bennett in the study of gravitropism and auxin regulated plant growth makes The Center for Plant Integrative Biology an excellent setting to investigate this biological process.",0,0
343,102501,No,Representational preconditions for understanding other minds in the service of human collaboration and social learning,"The central aim of the proposed research project is to systematically explore the empirical implications of a novel theoretical approach to the early representational preconditions and the functional structure of the mechanisms dedicated for understanding other minds. We aim to explore and shed new theoretical light on the basic cognitive and brain mechanisms  of the human social mind. One of these mechanisms that has received much attention by earlier approaches to ‘theory-of-mind’ research concerns the ability to infer and represent the mental states of others. Standard theories and research in the last twenty five years have suggested that representing other’s beliefs is an effortful and late developing capacity (Wellman et al., 2001) whose main function is to explain others’ behavior. Here we advance and propose to explore a new theoretical perspective according to which the mechanisms of mental state monitoring and representation involve primarily automatic and effortless processes grounded in on-line cooperative social interactions. Our approach is part of an on-going paradigm change in the field of theory-of-mind research motivated by the recent evidence showing that infants in their second year understand mental states (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005). Our own research has gone a significant step further by demonstrating that these mechanisms are present as early as 7 month of age, and by showing that both young infants and adults seem to automatically compute others’ beliefs even in situations where they are not required to do so (Kovács et al., 2010). The present project explores the functional sub-components and triggering conditions of young infants’ powerful belief computation abilities and to chart their developmental unfolding. Furthermore, we shall explore the implications of the new theoretical proposal that this dedicated system presupposes as its proper domain the on-going collaborative and communicative interactions.",0,0
726,222057,No,Voting on the future: Imaginaries and motivations in referendum decisions against extractive industries in Colombia.,"For countries in the global south, extractive industries can provide governments with a shortcut to economic development. For countries in the global south, extractive industries can provide governments with a shorcut to economic development. However, many communities where those project would take place reject them upfront and advocate for development of a different kind. In a unique and recent phenomenon, local communities in Colombia are organising referendums that halt resource extraction altogether. Since their appearance, very little research has been done to understand this phenomenon. Voting for or against a particular extractive project gathers an array of values, motivations and imaginaries that go beyond endorsement or rejection. Yet, voting in a certain way need not mean unity of opinions, and can obscure the struggles of campesinos and ethnic minorities for equality and access to land. Colombia’s legal framework permits citizens to call for referendums to decide issues that affect them. Wanting to vote for or against extractivism implies a desire to define the terms of the future in a region. The objective of this project is to explain the role of referendums against and in favour of extractive industries in articulating, or not, alternatives to extractivist development. It will do so by questioning whether a No to extractivism means a Yes to an alternative path to development, or if it means the continuation of the current social struggles. This in-depth study will employ ethnographic fieldwork, including participant-observation, interviews, and photography, to document the practices and discourses of actors involved in referendums. Referendums in Colombia provide insight of the wider trend of plebiscite democracy (e.g. Colombian peace and corruption referendums, Brexit, Catalonia) as supplement to institutional democracy (e.g. centralised, technocratic), in which casting a vote means more than endorsement or rejection of a particular political project.",1,0
985,187848,No,Understanding and Preserving Early Islamic Jericho: Towards a Management Plan for the Site of Khirbet el-Mafjar (Palestine),"Khirbet al-Mafjar is the most outstanding and best preserved Umayyad palace in the Near East and represents the first steps in the development of early Islamic architecture. It was built by the Umayyad Caliphs in their pursuit of a new visual culture and a theatre for their protocol apparatus, reinforcing their political identity, while establishing an instrument for territorial control in the making of the newly established Caliphate. It stands nowadays as an essential component of the Palestinian identity, and a basic landmark of their Cultural Heritage. The main objective of the project is to conduct interdisciplinary research on this complex, assessing its present condition and reviewing previous research, in order to draft a Management Plan which will guarantee its preservation and public enjoyment. The project involves researching how Cultural Heritage can become an engine of socio-economic development, a tool to reinforce the cultural identity of the local population and in the establishment of intercommunity dialogue that might help in the resolution of the current conflict.The fragmentary character of previous research was due mainly to approaches applied, as well as to political vicissitudes related to its location. This proposal intends to make an important step forward by building up an analytical strategy based on the methodological principles of Archaeology of Architecture, using the monument as a document, a stratified repository of material and social information about its transformation and change of use, gathering all sources of information into interdisciplinary interpretative models. This integration of archaeological, technological and historical research of the built heritage with its preservation and management provides the chance of finding in the material culture sources of historical and technological information which offer simultaneously the choice to understand its History and to provide technical knowledge required for its preservation.",0,0
219,59300,No,Psychology and Economics,"The standard economic theory often fails to provide results that fit the empirical evidence we have on human decision-making both at the micro-economic and at the macro-economic levels. Recently, the scientific communities in Psychology and Economics have demonstrated their willingness to co-ordinate their expertise in order to find a coherent formal framework that would capture the true preferences of individuals. Yet, only a few attempts in this direction have been made to date. The main objective of the proposed Euroworkshops is to promote a systematic co-operation between scholars in these two dynamics fields. Indeed, by bringing together academics in Economics and Psychology, the two conferences are expected to start developing a dual scientific community that would result in the creation of a new and more realistic approach to explain human behaviour. Moreover, this should help studying important issues such as environment, management of resources and growth. The proposed Euroworkshops will address two of the most important and controversial topics concerning human judgement, decision-making and, more generally, the relation between Economics and Psychology.  These are: 'Preferences and Utility Functions' and 'Judgement under Uncertainly'. First, it is widely argued in the psychology literature that the standard utility functions used in formal economic analyses fail to capture many aspects of individual decision-making. Therefore, identifying the essential modifications to the usual utility functions and incorporating these new elements would enable economists to provide a more realistic representation of agents' preferences and would result in more accurate predictions. Second, there is substantial evidence that incomplete information, together with the imperfect ability to acquire pieces of news, affect the decisions of individuals in systematic ways. Again, characterising the patterns of behaviour in each circumstance is essential to better understand human conduct, and to make predictions on future reactions. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-1999-00175-1.pdf",0,0
368,195993,No,"Adolescents, Parents and Digital Media: Looking for the pattern that dis/connects","This project will use a trans-disciplinary framework of social and developmental psychology and media and communications and the innovative methods of the First Person Perspective and Digital Ethnography to address existing gaps in research into the use of Information Communication Technologies, child development and family communication. Commenting upon research in the field, the recent report www.eukidsonline noted a prevalence of studies based on quantitative methods and a neglect of focus on mobile, convergent and emerging technologies. It also identified a persistent focus on risks and harm rather than opportunities and benefits and the lack of information on the role of adults, safety mediation and their effectiveness. This project fills these gaps by: (1) capturing the actual practices of adolescents with ICTs; (2) understanding how ICTs, family communication and parenting mutually shape one another; (3) exploring the opportunities and risks of ICTs for family and child development and the role of parents as safety mediators. A minimum of ten families with at least one adolescent child aged 13-16 will be recruited through Italian secondary schools to participate in the research which will involve data gathering via micro cameras (subcams) and video-interviews. Our innovative methods will provide new knowledge on: parents’ and adolescents’ individual and interpersonal practices in relation to ICTs; the goals, motives, representations and emotions underlying these practices and ICTs mediation processes in everyday family life. The implications of ICTs use for families and children’s health will also be considered. The results will be disseminated to socio-educational and clinical agencies, policy makers, and the general public. The fellowship will be  hosted by the Department of Social Psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, a pioneer in Digital Ethnography and co-supervised by the Department of Media and Communications.",1,0
214,107223,No,Assessing the effects of climate change on soil ecosystem functioning using an established alpine Microbial Observatory,"Soils are an invaluable asset for human wellbeing. Thus monitoring their quality and sustainable functioning should be a priority in a time of global change with unpredictable consequences. Climate-induced changes in species assemblages of biological communities are well documented. However, relatively little is known about such changes in microbial communities, in spite of their critical importance for ecosystem health. Microorganisms adapt faster to changing local conditions than plants and other macro-organisms, making them ideal as indicators for soil and ecosystem health. Thanks to their steep altitudinal gradients, mountain areas are particularly well suited for studying soil microbial community changes induced by climate change. This also makes them more vulnerable, increasing the risk for loss of biodiversity through mountaintop extinction and perturbations of ecosystem integrity. The advancement of DNA sequencing technologies now enables us to explore microbial diversity in-depth and to monitor microbial community composition and dynamics. In MicrObs, I propose an innovative study utilising “next generation” sequencing to survey and monitor the functional and compositional diversity patterns of soil microbial communities along an altitudinal gradient in response to climate change. A soil transplantation experiment will also be carried out to accelerate climate-induced changes. I seek to combine my existing skills with the expertise of the Soil Microbial Ecology Group at NEIKER, utilising the group’s unique “Microbial Observatory” Project. MicrObs will improve the current understanding of the impact of climate change on soil microbial communities and associated ecological processes, on local and global scales. In addition, it will facilitate for continued monitoring. The conceptual and methodological training objectives proposed will strengthen my scientific and management skills, enabling a future establishment as an independent researcher.",0,0

700,222779,No,Biological Physics of Living Active Nematics,"The growth of a bacterial colony is a fascinating example of a biological process that can be interpreted in physical terms as the interaction of a collection of elementary units - the cells - with the surrounding environment and within themselves, whereby energy is harnessed and dissipated, thus determining inherent non-equilibrium conditions. Although bacterial cells are one of the simplest forms of life, scientists have so far found difficult to build theoretical models of bacterial growth and morphology as well as to perform controlled experiments of the real systems occurring in nature. These difficulties arise from the naturally occurring conditions that are characterized by a large degree of complexity in both morphological and chemical terms. The aim of this project is to investigate through novel experimental approaches the biological physics which is at the foundation of the formation of 2D bacterial microcolony and its successive development to a 3D structure. To this purpose, several experimental techniques, from traction force microscopy, through laser ablation and soft lithography will be exploited. Furthermore, experimental results obtained from these studies will be of great relevance for the validation of numerical and theoretical models of bacterial colony morphogenesis and antibiotics exposure. The planned research activities will be carried out in one of the top research laboratory in Europe for active matter and within the wider context of École Normale Supérieure, a world renowned academic institution in the fields of statistical mechanics, soft matter and optics. This project aims thus at providing fundamental insights into the development of early stages of bacterial community formation, trying to establish what physical parameters related to the cells, the environment and their interactions determine the transitions from a 2D to a 3D structure, and lastly to gain control over these parameters.",0,0

3,225605,Yes,Emotional Acculturation:  Emotions as Gateways to Minority Inclusion,"International migration has often been referred to as one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Numbers of immigrants have been increasing, but social integration of migrants and their children is lagging at the detriment of immigrant minorities themselves and often resulting in conflict within receiving societies. EmotionAcculturation investigates the role of emotions, as key processes of interaction, for immigrant minorities’ social inclusion, and their wellbeing. It builds on research showing that, in each culture, emotions are socialized to fit the most valued kinds of relationships, and that the prevalent emotions, therefore, vary across different cultures. I postulate that misfit of the emotions of immigrant minorities with the typical majority emotions compromises interactions, and that this will hamper their social integration, and therefore their opportunities in the larger society. I study how and when emotional acculturation forms an important gateway to the social inclusion and wellbeing of immigrant minority individuals. The grant is organized around three Objectives: to better understand 1) the nature of emotional acculturation, 2) its conditions, and 3) its outcomes. I adopt a multi-method approach, following large numbers of immigrant minority and majority participants over time, in their everyday lives, and in real-time interactions in the laboratory. The project will span two receiving national contexts with different diversity climates (Belgium, California). It will shed light on understudied micro-processes involved in minority inclusion, and their social and health consequences. EmotionAcculturation offers a novel approach to psychological acculturation that goes beyond attitude change. Moreover, by studying emotional change beyond childhood, it also contributes to our understanding of how emotions are constructed through relational engagements, and how they facilitate social coordination and cohesion.",1,1

806,194553,No,3D Model Catalysts to explore new routes to sustainable fuels,"Currently fuels, plastics, and drugs are predominantly manufactured from oil. A transition towards renewable resources critically depends on new catalysts, for instance to convert small molecules (such as solar or biomass derived hydrogen, carbon monoxide, water and carbon dioxide) into more complex ones (such as oxygenates, containing oxygen atoms in their structure). Catalyst development now often depends on trial and error rather than rational design, as the heterogeneity of these composite systems hampers detailed understanding of the role of each of the components.    I propose 3D model catalysts as a novel enabling tool to overcome this problem. Their well-defined nature allows unprecedented precision in the variation of structural parameters (morphology, spatial distribution) of the individual components, while at the same time they mimic real catalysts closely enough to allow testing under industrially relevant conditions. Using this approach I will address fundamental questions, such as: * What are the mechanisms (structural, electronic, chemical) by which non-metal promoters influence the functionality of copper-based catalysts? * Which nanoalloys can be formed, how does their composition influence the surface active sites and catalytic functionality under reaction conditions? * Which size and interface effects occur, and how can we use them to tune the actitivity and selectivity towards desired products?  Our 3D model catalysts will be assembled from ordered mesoporous silica and carbon support materials and Cu-based promoted and bimetallic nanoparticles. The combination with high resolution characterization and testing under realistic conditions allows detailed insight into the role of the different components; critical for the rational design of novel catalysts for a future more sustainable production of chemicals and fuels from renewable resources.",0,0
507,96574,No,DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ANIMAL MODELS OF GLUTAMATERGIC CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS USING IN VIVO SIRNA AND TRANSGENIC APPROACHES,"Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory transmitter in the brain. However, very few models exist to explore the potential of drugs that modulate glutamate transmission. Because altered glutamate transmission is involved in numerous psychiatric diseases, there is a strong need for such models, to characterise the effects of hypo- and hyper-glutamatergic states on the onset and development of such diseases. AGLAEA will develop and characterise models of selective, partial knockdown of specific components of the brain glutamatergic system in mice. This will provide better comprehension of the implication of glutamate signalling in diseases such as schizophrenia, anxiety and cognitive disorders. AGLAEA will lead to breakthrough research on the neurobiological and neurochemical bases of psychiatric disorders and will enable the further testing of new drugs for treatment. In order to selectively turn off specific components of the glutamatergic pathways, an siRNA approach will be used. The effect of modulation of glutamate signalling will be characterised using functional MRI (fMRI) and microdialysis/microsensor analysis. Specific behavioural tests will be carried out on live animals for the assessment of glutamate-related psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the data collected from siRNA experiments will be applied to the generation of transgenic mice, in which modulation of glutamate signaling will be induced at different stages of development. Therefore, AGLAEA will provide both the pharmaceutical and the academic world with potent models. These models will be used to test novel compounds and assess their therapeutic value and will benefit researchers investigating the neurobiological and neurochemical bases of those diseases. The consortium set up to reach the objectives of AGLAEA gathers 3 high tech SMEs, 2 academic groups and one large group for the management of the project (ALMA), representing all together 4 European countries (FR, HU, UK, NL).",0,0

871,225727,No,A Model-driven development framework for highly Parallel and EneRgy-Efficient computation supporting multi-criteria optimisation,"Complex, dependable and physically-entangled systems of systems must be supported by innovations to allow a significant reduction of the cost and complexity of system design targeting computing platforms composed of parallel heterogeneous architectures. Software development is one key challenge, as current programming tools do not fully support emerging processor architectures. Parallel and heterogeneous platforms are difficult to program and even more to optimise for the multiple conflicting criteria imposed by applications, such as performance, energy efficiency, real-time response, resiliency and fault tolerance. AMPERE addresses this challenge by incorporating model-driven engineering (MDE) as the key element for the construction of complex software architectures. MDE enables to efficiently capture system's functional and non-functional requirements, including multiple conflicting requirements, as well as enabling the use of domain specific model-driven languages (DSML) to further refine the description of cyber/physical interactions. The vision of AMPERE is that there is a clear necessity of developing a new generation of code synthesis methods and tools capable to implement correct-by-construction systems, in which the constraints captured by the system model are efficiently transformed to the parallel programming models supported by the underlying parallel heterogeneous platform, whilst providing the level of performance required. Moreover, AMPERE will provide computing software composed of a set of advanced run-time methods implementing monitoring and dynamic reconfiguration techniques, that will support the parallel execution to improve the overall system's efficiency, and guarantee that the non-functional requirements capture by the DSML are fulfilled. AMPERE advances will be integrated in a set of ready-to-use tools and libraries, and validated through demonstration in two reference applications, from automotive and railway domains.",0,0

701,195159,No,"Towards a new framework for reception: Gongora’s poetics, ‘new’ readers and the material world","Luis de Góngora’s (1561-1627) two major compositions, Polifemo and Soledades (1613) represent a watershed in the trajectory of Spanish poetics; prompting a polemic over their stylistic innovations that would continue for three centuries. To date there has been suppression of the polemic’s politico-ideological underpinnings and undisputed acceptance that Góngora’s poetry was written to be read by an aristocratic, erudite elite. Consequently research on the reception of his work has been conceptually constrained and confined within the rigid parameters of documents relating to the controversy. The primary aim of this project is to challenge these fundamental assumptions of readership and reception and to propose a new methodological framework which has at its core a confluence of: (a) archival investigation; (b) analysis (qualitative and quantitative) of material evidence with digitalised data presentation; (c) a sophisticated theoretical underpinning that conceptualises literary reception within the wider tensions of socio-cultural self-constitution. The key sustaining hypothesis is that Góngora’s ‘new’ readers were not restricted to the intellectually-renovated receivers anticipated by the poet, but encompassed ‘other’ recipients drawn from a much broader socio-cultural spectrum (archival research carried out by the researcher informs this). Outputs include a journal article, a project website with open-access database, a book-length study and the organisation of an international conference. In line with MSCA objectives the project will enable a transfer of knowledge and interdisciplinary skills of mutual benefit to researcher and host; strengthen the contact networks of both, and enhance the career opportunities of the researcher through international exposure and inter-sectoral mobility. The project will promote collaboration between researchers, archivists and librarians, thus contributing to the recuperation of a significant aspect of Spain’s cultural heritage.-",0,0

Trento, Italy (UniTn), (ii) data analysis as being researched in various contexts at the Catholic University of Rio Grande del Sul, Brazil (PUCRS) and (iii) research in trust and privacy as pursued in the context of health, inclusion and other application areas at Newcastle University, UK (UNEW). Leveraging the ongoing collaboration with health professionals and research institutes in health and ageing, we ground our technology-driven work in real-life. We propose an exchange program that includes both research and teaching elements. In so doing, the proposed exchange program creates unique transfer of knowledge between the partners, beneficial for each individual partner, shifting and synergising the focus of the three concerned research groups, and with an exciting potential for follow-up and parallel projects in this important area.",0,0
478,209578,No,"The DIffuse Galaxy Expansion SignaTures In Various Observables project: understanding the emergence of diffuse, low surface brightness galaxies and the link to their dark matter haloes","I propose to carry out the ‘DIffuse Galaxy Expansion SignaTures In Various Observables’ (DIGESTIVO) project, a joint theoretical and observational effort alongside observers at the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC), to study the evolution and formation of Low Surface Brightness galaxies (LSBs), including the recently discovered Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs). LSBs are extremely dark matter dominated, faint objects hardly distinguishable from the night sky. In the last decade it has became clear that large numbers of LSB galaxies exist, opening a new window on galaxy evolution and formation. How do such diffuse galaxies form and evolve? How are they linked to their dark matter haloes, and how do they fit within the current cosmological model of galaxy formation?   To answer these questions, I will make use of state-of-the-art, sophisticated hydrodynamical numerical simulations of galaxies, my field of expertise, combined with new observational data of LSBs/UDGs, which will be attained by observers at the host institution thanks to new techniques that will push the frontier of LSB imaging with optical telescopes. The goal is to study and understand the properties of diffuse galaxies: we will test our current theory according to which LSBs/UDGs arise from gas outflow episodes driven by supernovae feedback, which give rise to an expanded distribution of dark matter and stars. Searching for signatures of dark matter and stellar expansion in LSB galaxies is indeed a central theme of the proposed research, as we try to  understand how LSBs  arise in a galaxy formation context, which is currently an open issue.  This is the first time that a joint theoretical and observational effort on LSBs is developed: ultimately, this will offer invaluable insights on the formation of such elusive galaxies and increase our understanding of the role of baryonic feedback in galaxy formation.",0,0
940,96931,No,MEMS-Based Electric Micropropulsion for Small Spacecraft to Enable Robotic Space Exploration and Space Science,"Our MicroThrust proposal addresses the FP7 target for advanced in-space propulsion technologies for solar system exploration. This research provides a key component in facilitating exploration missions: a technology that can substantially reduce the cost of undertaking particular types of robotic exploration. Building on the framework of a successful ESA study, our team of leading academics, research institutions and space companies has developed a conceptual design of a very small, yet highly performant electrical propulsion system. The conceptual design is based upon experimental data already obtained by team members. As a result we are confident that this system can provide the transportation element for taking nano/micro satellites to any location in the Earth-Moon system and will even allow missions to nearby planets and asteroids. The propulsion system will thus permit new exploration mission concepts. These missions due to their size will be developed within a fraction of the time for conventional missions. Their simplicity, perhaps even single instrument spacecraft, will reduce risk for carrying out the mission. Overall this will dramatically reduce cost of individual missions, thus providing more flight opportunities for planetary scientists and planetary exploration. To achieve these goals the propulsion technology has high performance at low mass and low power demand. The propulsion system is a microfabricated colloid thruster having a high degree of subsystem integration. Our work so far has demonstrated the capability of this concept to have a radically reduced part set making substantial progress towards a thruster-on-a-chip. Our experienced team will take the technology through to the significant position of having tested and fully characterized a breadboard model. The design approach is that this is also a proto-flight model such that gaining the final step of a flight test for the hardware is low risk and low development cost.",0,0
466,206989,No,"Fundamental physics, Cosmology and Astrophysics: Galaxy Clusters at the Cross-roads","The ClustersXCosmo ERC Starting Grant proposal has the goal of investigating the role of Galaxy Clusters as a cosmological probe and of exploiting the strong synergies between observational cosmology, galaxy formation and fundamental physics related to the tracers of the extreme peaks in the matter density field. In the last decade, astronomical data-sets have started to be widely and quantitatively used by the scientific community to address important physical questions such as: the nature of the dark matter and dark energy components and their evolution; the physical properties of the baryonic matter; the variation of fundamental constants over cosmic time; the sum of neutrino masses; the interplay between the galaxy population and the intergalactic medium; the nature of gravity over megaparsec scales and over cosmic times; the temperature evolution of the Universe. Most of these results are based on well-established geometrical cosmological probes (e.g., galaxies, supernovae, cosmic microwave background). Galaxy clusters provide a complementary and necessary approach, as their distribution as a function of time and observables is sensitive to both the geometrical and the dynamical evolution of the Universe, driven by the growth of structures. Among different cluster surveys, Sunyaev Zel'Dovich effect (SZE) detected catalogs have registered the most dramatic improvement over the last ~5 years, yielding samples extending up to the earliest times these systems appeared. This proposal aims at using a combination of the best available SZE cluster surveys and to interpret them by means of state-of-the-art computational facilities in order to firmly establish the yet controversial role of Galaxy Clusters as a probe for cosmology, fundamental physics and astrophysics. The timely convergence of current and next generation multi-wavelength surveys (DES/SPT/Planck/eRosita/Euclid) will be important to establish the role of Galaxy Clusters as a cosmological tool.",0,0

It will do this by investigating quotidian practices of mobility and in particular the early, liminal phases of migrant journeys through the city, producing a closely-focused study of spaces of first arrival for mobile people in Venice, such as inns, lodging houses, ferry stations and quays. Employing an innovative, interdisciplinary methodology, the project will map these key entry-points where new arrivals first sought shelter, food, work, information and human connection, revealing them as crucial sites of interaction and negotiation between newcomers and the local community and as hubs of the authorities’ developing systems of migrant surveillance and identification.  Dissemination of the research via a monograph, journal articles and conference papers, as well as planned Public Engagement activities including a digital map of sites of arrival, a radio documentary pitch and an interdisciplinary workshop, will provide a vital historical perspective to contemporary debates on European migration. More broadly, the research will foster knowledge and expertise on vital themes of European history such as the development of policies of reception and hospitality, integration and assimilation, border control and identification, and their impact on states and urban centres as well as on local communities and migrants themselves. The Fellowship will also offer the candidate exceptional knowledge transfer, training and career development opportunities; in particular, her research will be enriched by participation, at the host institution, in an unrivaled concentration of expertise on comparative, transnational and interdisciplinary dimensions of  European migration.",0,1

287,88101,No,"Role of ColQ, a specific collagen in the functionnal organisation of the neuromuscular junction","My research project is based on one principal axis: how extracellular matrix proteins participate to the functional organisation of the synapse. The goal of my research project is to study ColQ induced regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) expression process. Recently, during a collaborative project between Jean Cartaud and Claire Legay groups, we have shown that the C-terminal part of ColQ interacts with MuSK (muscle-specific tyrosine kinase receptor) ectodomain. This association is not only responsible for anchoring AChE in the synaptic basal lamina but could also play an important role in regulating AChR expression. Other works have shown that ColQ interacts with another partner, the perlecan, an extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) interacting with the Dystroglycan (DG). Based on these evidence, we hypothesized that ColQ could regulate the number of AChR via MuSK and/or perlecan/dystroglycan pathways. These signalling pathways would then be used as pivot adapting the number of AChE molecules to the number of AChR. Preliminary results from the laboratory confirm this hypothesis and suggest that ColQ regulates AChR and synaptic proteins expression and also suggest that ColQ may act via the two signalling pathways MuSK and perlecan/dystroglycan. Using various complementary approaches of biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology both in vitro and in vivo in mice, I will identify the signalling pathways induced by ColQ, in particular those involving ColQ/perlecan/dystroglycan and ColQ/MuSK.    This study will allow me to better understand the mechanisms by which ColQ controls the postsynaptic domain differentiation at the NMJ.",0,0
126,80818,Yes,Gender auditing the constitution for Europe,"The project 'Gender Auditing the Constitution for Europe' will evaluate from a gender perspective the legal implications of the present debate on the constitutional future of the European Union. While sex equality has always been an item on the agenda of the European Community, notably in the area of equal rights and treatment for women and men in employment, the work of the Constitutional Convention with its elaboration of a Constitution for Europe has highlighted the many and diverse implications of constitutional change for women in Europe.  The purpose of this research project is to 'audit' these changes for their capacity to further equality between women and men and to enhance the pursuit of gender justice within an enlarged Union; it being maintained that the task of developing a constitutionalist solution to the marginalisation of women from society is an imperative. The audit will be both technical (measuring the legal modifications proposed by the Constitution for Europe alongside the existing acquis communautaire on gender equality) and theoretical (assessing the lessons learned by the Convention process for furthering parity democracy and the representation of women in decision-making at the European level).  The objectives are (1) to produce a balance sheet demonstrating the gains and losses of the Constitution building exercise and (2) to make recommendations for the consolidation and future development of constitutional reform from a gender perspective.  The project is orientated around two major axes, which will audit (1) the gender input and (2) the gender output of the Constitution building process.  The first theme - gender input - comprises an audit of the level and effectiveness of female representation within the Constitutional Convention and beyond it. This part of the study will be framed within the wider social scientific debates on parity democracy and the desirability of constitutions alised quotas.",1,1
138,216509,Yes,"Inclusive Public Space: Law, Universality and Difference in the Accessibility of Streets","This project considers the accessibility of public space – focusing on pedestrian access to streets. It explores law’s engagement with the exclusion which occurs when streets are designed, operated or managed so as to deny access to pedestrians whose bodies, minds or life circumstances do not ‘fit’. Such exclusion is damaging both to individuals and communities. With a view to understanding how states and the EU can more effectively ensure that public space is inclusive, the project aims to deepen understanding of what physical features of streets are experienced as exclusionary in 5 countries and by whom; how effectively law is used to challenge such exclusion in these countries; and how the problem is perceived and politically challenged. It also aims to foster shared concern about this form of exclusion, in the 5 countries and beyond, and to raise awareness of how law can be used to challenge it. The methodology will be comparative, transdisciplinary and participatory in nature. It will develop innovative videovoice techniques for data gathering. It will also develop groundbreaking awareness-raising tools – such as software to simulate experiences of pedestrian exclusion – as well as digital story telling and legal orientation guides. Theoretical context and framing will be provided by an innovative blending of Martha Fineman’s universal vulnerability thesis with the social model of disability.  The project will be the first to bring a multinational sociolegal perspective to bear on this significant social justice problem. It is timely - given concerns about the move in EU countries (often supported by EU funding) toward streets in which space is shared by vehicles and pedestrians; and the ratification (including by the EU) of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is the first such treaty to include provisions on the accessibility of public space.",1,1

259,14532,No,Socioeconomic and Technological Impact Assessment and Forecasts,"The objective of this project is to assess the major socio-economic and technological issues facing Europe in the development of advanced communications. Research is being focused in three main directions:   - Quantitative and qualitative macroeconomics assessment of the contribution of increased investment in telecommunications infrastructures to increase productive efficiency and overall economic growth. - Potential of advanced telecommunications for the delivery of socially critical services (opportunities and barriers to deployment). - Socio-cultural needs at the individual and household level to access 'user-driven, computer-aided, multimedia, two-way communication services'.   In the third year, the project objective expands to address T.765 (Application Strategies for Advanced Communications), integrate conclusions with those relative to the current work and devise strategies which will enable advanced communications to reach its full potential both as a market and a tool for users. The objective of this research was to assess the major socioeconomic and technological issues facing Europe in the development of advanced communications. Research was focused in 3 main directions: quantitative and qualitative macroeconomic assessment of the contribution of increased investment in telecommunications infrastructures to increase productive efficiency and overall economic growth; the potential of advanced telecommunications for the delivery of socially critical services (opportunities and barriers to deployment); sociocultural needs at the individual and household level to access user driven, computer aided, multimedia, 2-way communication services.  The methodology followed for the macroeconomic assessment combined field research in the form of interviews with representative organizations from a range of industry sectors and member states of the European Community and input output causal analysis of Eurostat and other statistical tables with due consideration paid to diffusion models of advanced communication technology innovations, their effect on employment, and implications for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) and lesser developed regions.  The research has resulted in the following recommendations: It is most important that decision makers be made aware of the developing change of perspective for integrated broadband communications (IBC); Where action is taking place already, European players should be encouraged to compete right away with the United States for potential European business, and European firms should not wait for the United States to take the initiative for new project developments; Undue regulatory constraints, which bar the emergence of true multimedia communications at the initiative of telecommunication, cable television or others, should be removed; Progressive but strict new regulation is required to ensure that operators of the new network infrastructures will provide easy access for all organizations involved in the delivery of those socially critical services that could benefit much from advanced communication support, in particular schools, other educational institutions, hospitals and clinics; Public incentives may be in order to fill the gaps that will develop in the deployment process, either to get it started, to facilitate interconnection between national networks, or to encourage early deployment to less favoured areas. However, this should be on an ad hoc basis rather than planned and controlled centrally. Technical Approach   - Collect and consolidate, in co-operation with the concerned project teams, results of usage experience of advanced communications as experimented in RACE projects of relevance (Project Line 7 - ACE) and in other programmes/projects from elsewhere in the EC and other regions. - To develop and analyse the criteria that affect successful implementation and exploitation of advanced communication applications. - Develop, to the extent feasible, socio-economic cost benefit analyses and establish what incentives may be required to accelerate the process where appropriate.   Key Issues   - Telecommunication networks are entering a new era with breakthrough functionality and price/performance improvement potential. - User needs have yet to be consolidated and translated into Common Functional Specifications or the preparation of Common Practice Recommendations. - Even the qualitative assessment of how they can be put to work for the best benefit of the individual and the community requires much creative and forward looking thinking to reach beyond what a simplistic extrapolation of the past may suggest.   Expected Impact   The objective of the project is to develop recommendations for proactive deployment of effective pan-European advanced communication services to support economic and social objectives that are not directly market-driven.   It addresses the Commission's and Parliament's requests to develop an up-to-date assessment of socio-economic issues related to the deployment of IBC in Europe.",0,0
489,34944,No,Monitoring biodiversity in the North Sea using groundfish surveys,"1) To establish the value of existing national ground-fish surveys of the North Sea as monitors of fish and epibenthic biodiversity. 2) Where possible, to link trends in fish and epibenthic biodiversity for selected non-commercial species as revealed by these surveys with trends in fishing effort and methods, and/or environmental and ecological factors. 3) To try out and recommend practical methods for enhancing ground-fish surveys so that they better monitor fish and epibenthic biodiversity without disrupting their primary functions in the management and assessment of commercial fish stocks. Where necessary, to produce taxonomic aids suitable for use on survey vessels using the recommended methods. 4) To recommend protocols for the reporting and assessment of trends in biodiversity in order to monitor the well-being of North Sea fish and epibenthic ecosystems in relation to commercial fishing.  SUMMARY  Several nations undertake ground-fish surveys in the North Sea. This 3-year project is intended to show how value may be added to these surveys by monitoring biodiversity of non-commercial species in support of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio de Janeiro, 1992). The project is divided into four tasks. Firstly, existing ground-fish survey data on non-commercial fish, and where possible, epibenthic invertebrates, were analysed for information on biodiversity. It was concluded, as expected, that fish survey trawls are not good sampling tools for monitoring biodiversity. Secondly, a 2-metre beam trawl constructed from steel was tested at stations throughout the North Sea, and found to be a rugged and dependable survey tool for epibenthic biodiversity. Attempts are now being made to standardise towing distances. Thirdly, taxonomic material is being prepared to assist scientists on ground-fish surveys to readily identify benthic species caught by the beam trawl. This is taking the form of a computerised database with photographs. A fourth task, to be addressed in the final year of the project is the development of protocols for the reporting and assessment of trends in biodiversity so that the results of any future monitoring can be as relevant and accessible as possible. PROGRESS  1. Analyses of existing national ground-fish survey data for biodiversity data about the North Sea were undertaken by each national partner, and presented at a project symposium held at Aberdeen, Scotland in March 1997. Papers by specialists in related fields also came forward. The collected papers will be submitted to the European Commission as a project report, and a selection of them is also being refereed for publication. A general conclusion of the work was that ground-fish surveys using commercial trawling gear catch only a sub sample of the marine fauna, and additional gear must be deployed when monitoring biodiversity is the objective. A 2-metre, lightweight, steel beam trawl catches additional fish and epibenthic invertebrates, and was recommended as the supplementary gear. 2. Fishing effort by beam and otter trawlers in the North Sea from all fishing nations except Belgium and France has been compiled regionally (by ICES rectangle) for the years 1990-1995, and for Norway, Scotland, England and Wales for 1977-1989. These data will permit variations in trawling effort to be compared with variations in epibenthic communities and demersal fish. 3. The 2-metre beam trawl has been extensively fished on a wide range of substrate types in the North Sea, and found to be a rugged and dependable device for sampling the epifauna. A device to monitor the time spent actually fishing on the bottom has satisfactorily undergone preliminary trials, and is being developed further to permit the distance trawled to be standardised, an important consideration when assessing the occurrence of rare species. Trials have also been made with benthic grabs but these are less satisfactory because of variable performance on different substrates, the smallness of the sample, and the time and expertise taken to process the sample. This may mean that the infauna are not routinely sampled by a biodiversity monitoring programme as part of a ground-fish survey. In addition, equipment to assess the sea floor acoustically has been tested. These are likely to provide a useful supplement to trawl samples. A photographic archive of over 100 epibenthic species has been assembled for preparation of a taxonomic guide. The photos are being edited electronically and put into a computerised database to assist rapid identifications at sea with a minimum of specialised knowledge. 4. A working group has been arranged for April 1998 to test possible methods of analysing and reporting epibenthic biodiversity data. The data recently collected with the survey trawl by several project participants will be used.  DISCUSSION Experience in the first two years of this three year project has indicated that monitoring of epibenthic biodiversity during national ground-fish surveys in the North Sea is definitely feasible. Additional costs would be minimal. The epibenthic environment is, of course, only part of the marine system, and a recommendation to monitor the species present there as part of a ground-fish survey would not be meant to deny the importance to biodiversity of the benthic infauna, the plankton, the pelagic fish, marine mammals, the sea birds, etc. The problem with including these components in a monitoring programme is that they require special facilities and/or large amounts of time, which may not be available on all ground-fish surveys. The epibenthos also have particular relevance to studies of fish and fishing because they are directly vulnerable to heavy trawling gear, and because they form a component of fish diets.  An environmental concern about the North Sea is that many epibenthic species are opportunistic scavengers feeding on the living material broken or exposed by trawls, or on the fish caught and subsequently discarded from the fishing vessels. A time-series of epibenthic monitoring data obtained from a good spread of localities in the North Sea, as would be possible using ground-fish surveys, could help us to assess this concern, particularly if good figures on the locations of trawling effort can be obtained for the same time periods. The data collected so far on fishing effort by ICES rectangle reflect a valuable new international effort. Finer resolution geographically may be obtainable from national enforcement activities such as aerial spotting, but so far data from only one country have been obtained.  There are undoubtedly several other factors apart from trawling effort which help to shape epibenthic communities. A regular and complete series of monitoring data could provide the raw material for many academic and applied studies of these factors. One interesting study already begun in association with this project concerns the influence of life history strategies of different species on their present-day survival in the North Sea. However, in addition to the needs of scientists, a biodiversity monitoring programme should also provide information in summarised form to fisheries managers, other marine authorities, and to interested members of the public. It is these people who will decide whether something should be done to alter any ecologically unsatisfactory situations, which come to light. The challenge will be to capture and hold their attention with some kind of annual report of biodiversity monitoring data.  REFERENCES  Albert, O.T. (1993).

INTRODUCTION  New political significance was given to biodiversity by the Convention on Biological Diversity signed by heads of state at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Since fishing in the North Sea under the Common Fisheries Policy has been intense in recent years, and several commercial stocks are reported to be overexploited (Anon, 1994), significant mortalities of non-target and rare species are likely to have occurred as well. Changes in the balance of species could have led to a radically altered ecosystem, particularly on and near the sea bottom, parts of which are towed over repeatedly each year by heavy trawling gear. A recent review of global marine biological diversity (Norse, 1993) endorses this point, and states that there has been 'astoundingly little study of the effects of intense fishing pressure on sustainability' (of the marine ecosystem).  Several national ground-fish surveys are conducted in the North Sea, and are likely to continue in some form for the foreseeable future. Aside from their main purpose for estimating abundance indices of commercial fish, they provide records of the occurrence of a variety of non-commercial fish and, in some cases, epibenthic (i.e. living on the sea bottom) invertebrates which can be caught by the commercial-type trawling gear (usually of the GOV design) fitted with small mesh codend liners which is used on these surveys. The species collected form a subset of the full range of species present in these groups in the North Sea, but existing data extend over many years (back to the 1920s for one set). Studies of fish species were reported by Green-street (1992) and Green-street & Hall (1994).  Using small beam trawls, grabs, and/or sonic devices capable of identifying characteristics of the sea bottom, it is possible that future information on biodiversity coming from ground-fish surveys could be considerably enhanced without necessarily disrupting normal working practices or adding significantly to costs. It is necessary that special gear be deployable quickly and easily, and that resources for taxonomic identification are available. Provided that the inconvenience and extra costs of monitoring biodiversity could be kept small, countries participating in this project could consider augmenting their surveys for this new purpose.  Rees (1994) recently conducted epibenthic surveys in the North Sea and elsewhere around England and Wales using a 2-metre beam trawl with a 10 mm square mesh belly, 3 mm mesh codend liner and three tickler chains. More than 300 species were found, considerably more than would have been taken by a GOV or similar commercial trawling gear. Comparable but more intensive surveys of the North Sea epifauna have been reported by, for example, Dyer et al. (1983), Frauenheim et al. (1989) and Duineveld and van Noort (1990). Rees (1994) reports that despite differences in sampling methodology, all have identified a broad division between a 'northern' and 'southern' fauna approximately along the northern edge of the Dogger Bank. This division was similar to that proposed by Glenmarec (1973) for the North Sea, based upon thermal stability of the water-column.  Fish communities in the North Sea, as revealed by Scottish trawl surveys, were studied by Green-street (1992, 1994). Differences in diversity and size spectra were found among three north western regions near Scotland, and between the periods 1929-1956 and 1975-1993. This implies that existing ground-fish survey data can provide useful information on biodiversity of fish, and that fuller analyses of a wider range of data will be worthwhile. Examples of special ecological studies of fish communities in the North Sea have been published by Bergstad (1990) and Albert (1993).",0,0
50,84612,Yes,Women scientists in Gender-Specific Technological R&D - How do women scientists in technological R&D respond to the needs of women end-users?,"The project aims at clarifying the process of how women scientists engaged in technological R&D respond to the needs of women end-users. The study will display economic and socio-cultural factors that influence gender-specific end-user interaction with women researchers by comparing and analysing gender equality in R&D in the cases of two transition economies - Poland and China - and two technological applications - teleservices and agricultural implement. The Polish and Chinese societies are experiencing a rapid economic and technological transition. Demand for technology is diversifying and the structures of end-users in different technological fields are being re-shaped. In the process, women in China and Poland have become crucial user groups for technical applications both in the traditional agricultural sector and the rapidly growing telecom sector.  This development requires more gender-specific R&D and the harnessing of social capital of women in R&D. An attractive environment for investors and strong scientific bases make both China and Poland significant actors in technological research. Women have equal opportunities for higher education in these countries and in Poland women are generally better educated than men. However, women are poorly represented in scientific research, particularly in the fields of engineering and natural sciences. Moreover, the male perspective is the norm in technological R&D and articulation of demand for new products is the prerogative of men. Gender equality may be on the political agenda but is hardly addressed in technological R&D.  This study will clarify the opportunities for women scientists in technological R&D to interact with women end-users. Based on the results of the study, policy recommendations will be formulated for better gender equality in technological R&D. This study will increase awareness and comprehension of the gender issue in scientific research among decision makers and the broader public.",1,1

SoCaTel will create, implement and pilot a multi-module/multi-stakeholder platform, which fosters ageing-in- place in a friendly environment and community. This platform, based on past project results such as OASIS and its open government platform Ozwillo, will facilitate end-users’ free choice of government and non-government long-term care services according to their needs, and will empower citizens’ voices and their representatives to champion their causes. Users, public services and innovators will collaborate throughout the process, from design through to development and testing, and onto implementation – facilitating the co-creation of novel services to address emerging needs and opportunities, while encouraging bottom-up innovation. SoCaTel will use governmental and private data sources, via links to platforms such as UniversAAL and PERLIS elderly supervision system, thus also creating additional business opportunities. The SoCaTel approach and platform will be piloted in 4 countries, involving service users, government authorities, universities and the private sector: Spain, Finland, Hungary and Ireland, thus covering different welfare state models and addressing different challenges and cultural settings.  SoCaTel puts forward solid frameworks for co-creation, impact assessment, ethics and change management, promoting a smooth introduction of co-creation approaches into public administration. The outputs of the project will be a range of services co-created during the pilots and ready to be deployed.

903,110503,No,Innovation Framework for Privacy and Cyber Security Market Opportunities,"Innovation drives new product realisation and development. Significant opportunities exist for innovation in the privacy and cyber security (PACS) technology space, yet complex market, regulatory, policy, commercial, and economic considerations create several barriers to transforming research outputs into market-centric product and service applications. In response, Innovation Framework for Privacy and Cyber Security Market Opportunities (IPaCSO) will develop a structured knowledge and decision-support innovation framework for identifying, assessing and exploiting market opportunities in the privacy and cyber security technology space. IPaCSO will support security innovators, policy makers and research spectrum stakeholders in identifying, assessing and exploiting new ideas and research assets using innovation and market assessment best-practice and guidelines and bringing them to market.Achieving project impact objectives can be challenging for ICT security research projects thus through the adoption and utilisation of the IPaCSO innovation framework we propose that projects can increase the impact of their project results. IPaCSO will address the following main goals:\tAssess existing innovation processes used in the  PACS domain  via in-depth stakeholder engagement\tIdentifiy a set of innovation framework requirements, interleaving improved innovation practices and case study scenarios, that support PACs domain concerns\tAssess existing economic barriers to innovation and identify appropriate economic incentives needed to increase security product and service adoption\tDevelop an appropriate knowledgebase and decision support approach that is transferrable to PACS technologies exploiting potential market opportunities.\tDevelop effective training, exploitation and dissemination of the resultant IPaCSO framework to target stakeholder groups, both during and beyond the project lifecycle.The proposed work will focus on key thematic areas within the PACs domain, for example, security concerns across different OSI layers, emerging mobile and telecoms security, security monitoring and incident response, emerging notions of privacy and identity, embedded security, and emerging managed security services models. Such concerns will be considered in the context of wider ICT factors such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, emerging internets of services and things, and similar IT macro factors. IPaCSO project activities will lead to a structured understanding of such thematic market areas, a clearer understanding of how existing market barriers can be addressed within innovation frameworks, providing practical support for PACs stakeholders in producing improved market focussed outputs in the future.",0,0
693,186988,No,A European Maritime e-Compliance Cooperation Model,"e-Compliance will build upon strengths created across numerous EU projects in order to facilitate tighter integration and co-operation in the fragmented field of regulatory compliance in the maritime domain. Regulations are created by numerous different bodies, with little co-operation between them. As such, there is a significant lack of cohesion between the vast array of regulations and the possibility of conflicting regulations is very real. By creating a model for managing regulations digitally and creating services for all the different stakeholders, e-Compliance can harmonize these regulations and allow for co-operation between the different stakeholder groups. Not only will this improve the quality of regulations, but it will also reduce the burden for those having to enforce the regulations as well as those who must comply, resulting in a regulatory regime that is more effectively implemented. e-Compliance will also develop capabilities to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the current active regulations and allow preparation for regulations that will take effect in the future.",0,0
288,40090,No,Long-term regional effects of climate change on european forests: Impact assessment and consequences for carbon budgets,"Forests are especially vulnerable to climate change, due to the longevity of trees and the expected climate change within their lifespan. Through its impact on forest growth, climate change will affect both long-term wood supply and carbon sequestration in trees, forest soils and wood products. The central objective of the LTEEF-II project is to assess climate change impacts on European forests with respect to water and carbon fluxes, regional differences, long-term effects, and the overall carbon budget for forests in Europe. The results of this assessment will be used to identify sustainable forest management strategies that account for these impacts, and that maximise carbon sequestration.  Extensive research has been performed over the last decades: 1) determination how climate affects plant physiological processes and forest growth, both by experiments and by process-based models; 2) compilation and analysis of forest inventory data throughout Europe; 3) analysis and use of remote sensing data for NPP studies at a European scale; and  4) down-scaling of climate change prediction to the regional scale. Using results of this, it is now feasible to make future projections of long-term impacts of climate change based on the main forest types in Europe (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean), and to scale up from local to regional, national and European level.  This will be done by:  A. assessment and process-based modelling of the long-term regional impacts of climate change on European forests, and  B. upscaling of such regional responses to the European scale by both forest inventory data and remote sensing data.  The results will include:  1) assessment of likely responses of forest to climate change in the main regions in Europe;  2) quantification of changes in fluxes of carbon and water between vegetation and the atmosphere, in both timing and magnitude;  3) assessment of possibilities of acclimation by means of self-regulating processes of existing forests;  4) identification of response strategies for forest management; 5) assessment of the carbon balance for the forest sector.  The consortium proposing the project consists of 14 groups working throughout Europe within the field of:  1) mechanistic modelling of forests growth,  2) analysing growth and yield based on forest inventories (large scale forestry model), and  3) GIS and remote sensing.  The proposed project directly builds upon a recently finished European project (LTEEF, 1994-1996) in which the potential for existing forest stands to acclimate to changing climatic conditions was analysed. The project has direct links to the ECOCRAFT and EUROFLUX initiatives, and intensive collaboration with these groups is agreed upon.",0,0
191,215050,No,Fire Impacts in Rainforest Ecotones,"Amazonian rainforest ecotones (AREs) are one of the most heavily exploited and most threatened ecosystems in the Amazon. Fire plays an integral role in maintaining these vegetation transition zones from fire-averse rainforest to fire-prone savanna vegetation. Synergies between direct human activity and indirect climate change impacts threaten to accelerate forest transformation through positive feedback loops by increasing future fire susceptibility, fuel loads and fire intensity. As regional precipitation is expected to decrease due to deforestation and reduced evapotranspiration, and natural- and human-caused ignitions are projected to increase fire in AREs. The combined results will likely drive the expansion of savanna forests at the expense of the rainforest vegetation. AREs have largely been neglected in fire management strategies and the long-term  ecological effects of fire in AREs remain poorly understood. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the long-term effects of climate variability and human disturbance on fire in these vital ecosystems to inform future land-management and conservation efforts.  The objective of this proposal is to determine the natural and human-caused drivers of fire in the Bolivian ARE for the past 8,000 years. I have thus developed a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary framework integrating high-quality palaeoecological, palaeoclimatological data with current archaeological survey data to provide long-term records of natural variability and human land-use change. These new data will be incorporated into various scenarios in statistical Structural Equation Models to investigate natural and human factors driving fire in AREs for the past 8 thousand years. I will develop a case study for proof-of-concept of a new interdisciplinary framework that will result in a greater understanding of the long-term drivers of fire in AREs and inform how future climate and changes in land-use practices may impact these vital ecosystems.",0,0
831,209523,No,Brain-speech tracking in noisy conditions: towards the identification and remediation of dyslexia.,"Dyslexia is a developmental disorder leading to reading difficulties. It affects 5–12 % of children and young adults. Unfortunately, we still lack efficient and cost effective methods to identify and remedy this disorder. Dyslexia appears to be frequently linked to hindered phonological processing at the cortical level, with drastic consequences in the presence of noise. The overarching goal of this project is to better understand cortical speech processing in the presence of noise, in order to provide novel identification and remediation methods for dyslexia. Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography studies have uncovered the phenomenon of brain-speech tracking, that is, the tracking of continuous speech sounds by cortical activity. This tracking is suggested to reflect speech sound chunking and parsing mechanisms, and is altered in dyslexic readers. Importantly, it can be used to evaluate brain capacity to track a sound stream of interest in the presence of noise. Given that individuals’ capabilities to discriminate speech in noisy conditions improve until age ~12, we propose, as a first step, to characterize brain-speech tracking in the presence of noise 1) across the normal development and 2) in children with dyslexia. To modulate task difficulty, we will use several types of noise (from white noise to babble), with or without visual information of the speaker’s lip movements. We will then attempt to predict subjects’ reading skills based on their brain-speech tracking parameters (i.e. their fingerprint of brain-speech tracking capabilities). Finally, we will evaluate whether neurofeedback sessions can sustainably boost brain-speech tracking. These developments are instrumental to the realization of future studies intended to restore the integrity of brain-speech tracking capabilities, with the aim of alleviating the reading deficits of dyslexic readers.",0,0
638,198460,No,"An ARTery of EMPIRE. Conquest, Commerce, Crisis, Culture and the Panamanian Junction (1513-1671)","European incursions onto the narrow isthmian pass that divided and connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans made it a strategic node of the Spanish Empire and a crucial site for early modern globalization.  On the front lines of the convergence of four continents, Old Panama offers an unusual opportunity for examining the diverse, often asymmetrical impacts of cultural and commercial contacts. The role of Italian, Portuguese, British, Dutch, and French interests in the area, as well as an influx of African slaves and Asian merchandise, have left a unique material legacy that requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to its varied sources. Bones, teeth and artifacts on this artery of Empire offer the possibility of new insights into the cultural and biological impact of early globalization.  They also invite an interdisciplinary approach to different groups’ tactics for survival, including possible dietary changes, and the pursuit of profit. Such strategies may have led the diverse peoples inhabiting this junction, from indigenous allies to African and Asian bandits to European corsairs, to develop and to favor local production and Pacific trade networks at the expense of commerce with the metropolis. This project applies historical, archaeological and archaeometric methodologies to evidence of encounters between peoples and goods from Europe, America, Africa and Asia that took place on the Isthmus of Panama during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Forging an interdisciplinary approach to early globalization, it challenges both Euro-centric and Hispano-phobic interpretations of the impact of the conquest of America, traditionally seen as a demographic catastrophe that reached its nadir in the so-called seventeenth-century crisis.  Rather than applying quantitative methods to incomplete source material, researchers will adopt a contextualized, inter-disciplinary, qualitative approach to diverse agents involved in cultural and commercial exchange.",0,0
770,97662,No,European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours - Structuring clinical research on adrenal cancers in adults,"Among patients with adrenal masses Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and malignant pheochromocytomas (MPH) are found with a low incidence but very unfavorable prognosis. Due to this poor clinical outcome, concomitant hormone dysregulation and limited treatment options the two cancer entities severely impact on affected patients. However, the rarity of the tumors also impedes clinical studies which are affected by fragmentation and low cohort sizes. The European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENS@T) has recently implemented a collection of adrenal tumor related databases and defined an associated network of Biological Resource Centers devoted to research on adrenal tumors. The concurrence of recent achievements of this evolving network, the progress in the understanding of molecular mechanisms and increasing availability of specific diagnostic and therapeutic tools for adrenal cancers provides the unique opportunity to achieve unmatched progress in the implementation of both translation and clinical research dedicated to ACC and MPH. Specifically, the newly formed ENS@T-CANCER consortium will address the following topics: 1. Structuring European clinical and translational research through implementation of a virtual research environment, 2. Improving clinical outcome of patients with adrenal cancer by conducting interventional trials carried out by European centers of excellence, 3. Improvement of differential diagnosis and risk stratification of adrenal cancer, 4. Identification and validation of tools for follow-up of patients with adrenal cancer, 5. Identification of novel biomarkers for treatment response. The ultimate aim of the ENS@T-CANCER Consortium is to develop research in the field of adrenal cancers to improve diagnosis and treatment abilities. The Network will allow recruiting sufficient patients in all relevant European centers, to harmonize diagnosis criteria and to use the various technological approaches of a number of laboratories.",0,0

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies have been envisioned as a key to the successful deployment of next generation networks, which are challenged by many practical constraints, such as spectrum scarcity and dynamical wireless environments. The ATOM project will set an ambitious research agenda to fully exploit the potentials of MIMO technologies for revolutionizing wireless networks. Particularly the overall objective of ATOM is to accelerate the transfer and deployment of research knowledge between European countries and third-country partners in order to provide a framework of advanced MIMO solutions for realizing green, secure and high data throughput wireless communications. The novelty of this project is four-fold. Firstly the project brings together two advanced MIMO technologies, massive MIMO and cloud radio access networks (C-RAN), where a novel heterogeneous network architecture is proposed to boost network capacity by effectively exploiting the advantages of massive MIMO and C-RAN. Secondly a rigorous algorithm-theoretic framework for maximizing energy efficiency is developed for the proposed heterogeneous architecture, where energy harvesting is realized by applying the novel concept, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Thirdly dynamic physical layer conditions in wireless environments are used to develop comprehensive security solutions for implementing keyless secure transmissions as well as key establishment, which will bridge the gap between physical layer security and the conventional cryptography. Finally we will extend the existing wireless network testbed available at the consortium and carry out experimental evaluations for closing the gap between theory and practice.",0,0
434,220861,No,Understanding the diversity of galaxy morphology in the era of large spectroscopic surveys,"Galaxies are the building blocks of structure in the Universe; this proposal seeks to understand how their shapes, colours and dynamics are determined. For example, what happened in the history of some galaxies to transform them into passive ellipticals while others, seemingly of the same mass and in the same environment, are star-forming spirals? Even such a basic question about the link between morphology and star formation has not yet been answered, revealing our theories of galaxy formation are inadequate. This is a major concern in an era where understanding the shapes of galaxies and how they relate to the underlying dark matter is essential for progress in precision cosmology.    This project will build the missing link between the history of a galaxy and its observational properties (i.e. between cause and effect) by using numerical simulations.  Current research in this area rightly gives significant attention to the crucial problem of how feedback – energy input from supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and more – affect observable properties.  But as well as investigating this avenue, GM Galaxies will uniquely make use of my new technique (“genetic modification”) to systematically investigate the role of the galaxy’s merging and accretion history at high resolution.  To distinguish the fingerprints of history from the effects of feedback, we will compare to rich new data from integral field unit surveys; these reveal, for example, galactic metallicity and velocity maps. My pilot study for this project shows that such measures of a galaxy disambiguate between alternative formation routes to galaxies which would appear similar by photometric measures alone. Similarly, we will make predictions for the observable properties of the gas reservoir surrounding galaxies and for integral field observations at high redshift. In this way we will make a predictive account of how galactic structure is determined by the interaction of the accretion history with feedback.",0,0

It needs to prepare to respond to new threats and assist casualties after security incidents. In response to this challenge, NO-FEAR proposes to bring together a pan-European network of practitioners, decision and policy makers in the medical and security fields. They will collaborate to achieve a common understanding of needs, as well as - in collaboration with academia and industries – increase the EU innovation potential that could better fill the operational gaps and recommend areas for future innovations.  NO-FEAR main objectives are to: - create a long-lasting community of practitioners, interacting with a network of suppliers and academia, - elaborate an innovation roadmap, with practical recommendations for uptake,  - advise relevant Research and Innovation projects,  - support market uptake of EU research results,  - issue policy and regulatory recommendations enabling collective procurement, - indicate priorities for standardisation;  - support quick wins and practical short term results, - implement a transactional dynamic portal providing fora, a catalogue, market place and flexibility to address new threats. The project will be conducted by a consortium of 18 partners, of which 11 and the coordinator are practitioners, under the advice of the EC Community of Users. It aggregates the various dimensions of the project (acute care, operations and training), supported by the already large networks. To disseminate and exploit the NO-FEAR recommendations, an ambitious strategy will be implemented, including workshops, demonstrations and communication events every 6 months.

653,65248,No,Superfluidity in an ultracold mixture of lithium bose-fermi gases,"Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is at the basis of several phenomena in physics: super fluidity and superconductivity are believed to be manifestations of BEC. While BEC's have been successfully created in ultra-cold atomic gases since 1995, its counterpart of a super fluid Fermi gas (BCS) still remains to be realized. The achievement of a Fermi super fluid in an ultra cold gas is considered as the next major breakthrough in atomic physics. The lithium experiment at ENS has the ability to combine these types of super fluids, because it utilizes a mixture of both fermionic and bosonic isotopes. For the creation of a super fluid Fermi gas the properties of two-body interactions are much more critical then fora BEC, and regular interaction strengths give a critical temperature estimate far out of range in current experiments. However, scattering properties can be manipulated with magnetic fields and give rise to a strong coupling mechanism. We will investigate the incorporation of these microscopic resonant interactions into the many-body descriptions of these quantum gases, and work in close collaboration with the experimentalists on difficulties along the road to BCS. The goal is to find a way to experimentally realize a super fluid Fermi gas , and to do new experiments which involve the coherences of both BEC and BCS sysems, and shed light on the connection between these two regimes. A field of study will be the formation of cold molecules out of these two types of quantum fluids .At ENS, I will largely benefit from the presence of the lithium Bose- Fermi mixtures experiment of prof. Salomon, and the ability to interact with all the experimentalists in this group. My theoretical supervisor prof. Shlyapnikov is well known in atomic physics and has many contributions in the field of ultra-cold many-body quantum systems. Moreover, the physics department of ENS is largely devoted to cold atomic physics, and the interaction with other people at the institute, both face to face and in group meetings, will be very stimulating for the research. The institute ENS will benefit from my background in cold collision physics, which was my field of research during my doctoral period.

308,72293,No,Analysis of Marketing Information for Small- and Mediumsized Enterprises,"Enterprises, who want to branch out their products in new markets, have to collect and analyse information to assure marketing decisions. The necessary information can affect the aimed market, customer needs, potential competition, laws, regulations, pending patents etc. This task needs special know how and considerable efforts, which can hardly adduced by small and medium-sized enterprises. Today research institutes, by information specialists and of course in the internet, already offer a huge quantity of information. Search and use of this information turn out to be difficult, because it is hard to answer questions for a foreign market, which is completely or partly unknown. This question has to be answered today by marketing specialists and sales representatives. But a typical SME cannot afford continuous and extensive market research.

The main research core of INDESMOF is based on the nano-encapsulation of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) within the ordered porous structures of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF), in order to obtain a highly porous MOF material, combined with the metal chelation and solvation specificity of DES. Incorporation of high-capacity high-selectivity adsorbent materials within polymeric support is a crucial challenge faces in INDESMOF towards the real application of the MOF@DES materials in water filtering systems, indispensable for mining and industrial water environmental remediation technologies. Development and improvement of advanced filtering technologies requires the joint effort of a multidisciplinary researcher collective, involving the expertise of participants on different disciplines including physics, chemistry, environmental chemistry, materials and polymer science and engineering. Background knowledge and knowhow of INDEMOF´s partners combine the complementarities and synergies needed to undertake an integrative and concerted effort through innovation and breakthrough actions towards the fabrication of advanced and specific filters for polluted water remediation. Results will be widely disseminated through publications, workshops, post-graduate courses to train new researchers, a dedicated webpage, and visits to companies working in the area.

592,80659,No,Detection and identification of rare audio-visual cues,"The machine handling of complex sensory stimuli is an extremely important but, as yet, elusive engineering goal. Biological organisms are good at detecting and identifying 'out-of-the-ordinary' events. Machines function best in unchanging, stationary environments, in which all event types are represented in the training data. The goal of the project is to address this machine weakness.  We will design and develop an environment-adaptive autonomous active system that will detect and identify rare events from the information derived by multiple, active information-seeking sensors. Such a system will probe for relevant cues, will autonomously adapt to new and changing environments, and will reliably discard non-informative data.  The project offers an integrated approach, ranging from neurophysiological research at the single cell level, up to building an engineering system. We aim at safety and security applications, but the results of the development will be equally relevant to a wide range of other applications in information and communication technology, unobtrusive monitoring in healthcare, and intelligent devices that enhance human cognitive performance.  The progress in our research will be measured by two criteria: - qualitative - consistency of new models with physiological and psychophysical data, and -quantitative - including the newly developed techniques in state-of-the-art information processing technology and evaluating the improvements in performance.  To achieve our goals, we have assembled partners with a strong motivation to advance the basic science of understanding and modeling cognitive systems, with equally strong interest in building useful technology.  Besides the fulfilment of our scientific and technological goals, another important result of DIRAC will be long lasting collaboration between cognitive sciences and engineering, resulting in a new generation of researchers, trained in both cognitive disciplines and in engineering.",0,0

The objectives of the project are to provide a detailed molecular and functional description of novel peptide-based communication pathways that are thought to modulate pain in the nervous system. One pathway makes use of nociceptin, the recently identified natural agonist of ORL1, a Gprotein-coupled neuroreceptor closely related to opioid receptors. The other may utilize F15Q, a peptide of yet unknown receptor, which is also present as one potentially excisable copy in pronociceptin, nociceptin's precursorpolypeptide. When centrally (i.c.v.) administered in rnice, nociceptin and F15Qboth render the animals' hyperreactive to thermal nociceptive stimulation, suggesting that the two heptadecapeptides may normally act to produce orexacerbate the pain sensation. Most irnportantly then, antagonists of thenociceptin (ORL1) and/or F15Q (unknown) receptors should display analgesic activity. Molecular description: in order to provide a structural basis to the rational design of better adapted ligands, including antagonists (potential new analgesics), the functional architecture of the ORLI receptor and the structure-activity relationships of nociceptin (Noc) will be analysed by means of protein engineering (receptor) and peptide synthesis (ligand). 3-D models of the Noc-ORLl receptor complex will provide assistance. In parallel, a specific receptor for the F15Q 'orphan' peptide will be searched for as a specific, high affinity [3HlF15Q binding site in nerve tissue. If the site proves to exist, we propose to clone the cDNA encoding the F15Q receptor.  Functional description: localization of pronociceptin's mRNA and/or of the peptides (nociceptin and F15Q) along pain pathways in the rat and/or mouse nervous system will provide additional although indirect evidence that the pronociceptin gene products are involved in nociperception. More directly the two peptides will be tested for pro-nociceptive (and other) activities in vivo, using behavioural paradigms based on various pain modalities (thermal vs. mechanical, cutaneous vs. visceral, spinal vs. supraspinal, acute vs. chronic) and electrophysiological studies will be carried out to demonstrate direct (spinal) or indirect (supraspinal) stimulatory effects of nociceptin and/orF15Q on spinal nociceptive neurons in situ. It is also envisaged to generate transgenic mouse strains, which do not express a functional ORLl orpronociceptin gene, hence, which might display reduced pain sensitivity. Along this same line, we propose to search for mutations of the ORLl and pronociceptin genes in blood samples from patients suffering congenital insensitivity to pain. This multidisciplinary approach involving five research teams with complementary technological abilities should speed up comprehension of the physiological roles of pronociceptin-derived neuropeptides and, most importantly, provide the pharmaceutical industry with new targets and the tools to develop novel, non-opiate analgesics. 07",0,0
824,204698,No,"Fair and Consistent Border Controls? A Critical, Multi-methodological and Interdisciplinary Study of Asylum Adjudication in Europe","‘Consistency’ is regularly cited as a desirable attribute of border control, but it has received little critical social scientific attention. This inter-disciplinary project, at the inter-face between critical human geography, border studies and law, will scrutinise the consistency of European asylum adjudication in order to develop richer theoretical understanding of this lynchpin concept. It will move beyond the administrative legal concepts of substantive and procedural consistency by advancing a three-fold conceptualisation of consistency – as everyday practice, discursive deployment of facts and disciplinary technique. In order to generate productive intellectual tension it will also employ an explicitly antagonistic conceptualisation of the relationship between geography and law that views law as seeking to constrain and systematise lived space. The project will employ an innovative combination of methodologies that will produce unique and rich data sets including quantitative analysis, multi-sited legal ethnography, discourse analysis and interviews, and the findings are likely to be of interest both to academic communities like geographers, legal and border scholars and to policy makers and activists working in border control settings. In 2013 the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) was launched to standardise the procedures of asylum determination. But as yet no sustained multi-methodological assessment of the claims of consistency inherent to the CEAS has been carried out. This project offers not only the opportunity to assess progress towards harmonisation of asylum determination processes in Europe, but will also provide a new conceptual framework with which to approach the dilemmas and risks of inconsistency in an area of law fraught with political controversy and uncertainty around the world. Most fundamentally, the project promises to debunk the myths surrounding the possibility of fair and consistent border controls in Europe and elsewhere.",0,0

797,222355,No,Hypothalamic Modulation of Neocortical States,"The neocortex is densely innervated by neuromodulatory systems that act through the release of hormones, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters such as histamine (HA), acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT), which modulate cortical function by diffusely targeting neurons and synapses in neural microcircuits. These neuromodulators regulate shifts between behavioral states such as sleep and wakefulness, or distraction and attention by controlling rhythmic network activity. It is thought that neuromodulators regulate rhythmic activity by controlling the intrinsic characteristics of neuronal networks across different organizational levels – dendritic properties, cellular physiology, synaptic plasticity, and microcircuit dynamics. Recent work has demonstrated that high-frequency “gamma” oscillations (30-80 Hz), which crucially subserve cognitive processes such as attention, learning and memory, are associated with an increase in HA levels in subcortical regions. Altered levels of HA in the neocortex and dysfunction of its receptors have been implicated in the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease – pathologies whose economic cost to Europe has been estimated at about € 200 billion per year. Despite the importance of HA in brain function and dysfunction, the mechanisms through which it controls neuronal, synaptic, dendritic, and microcircuit activity in the neocortex are unknown. Therefore, the objective of the HYMNS project is to employ an innovative combination of experiments and computational modelling to provide a unifying view of the mechanisms by which HA enables rhythmic microcircuit activity by controlling different organizational levels in the neocortex. The novel methods established in HYMNS will be useful not only for studies of HA but also for future investigations of other neuromodulators.",0,0
703,79866,No,Understanding prion strains and species barriers and devising novel diagnostic approaches,"The existence of stable strains of prions, differing in incubation times, clinical features, and neuroanatomical PrPSc deposition, is disquieting. The structural and biological features which encode strains and determine their disease phenotype are obscure. Some strains, including BSE, easily traverse species barriers causing serious concerns in the EU. Promiscuous strains present a public health threat if they propagate through the food chain, while remaining either undetected or misidentified. These dangers are illustrated by the atypical cases of scrapie which have appeared throughout the EU, including in sheep hitherto considered genetically resistant, and by the identification of BSE in a goat in France. As yet there are no diagnostic procedures to identify TSE strains, except in some rare cases. We propose studying fundamental and applied aspects of prions strains and their relationship to the species barrier, and to use the knowledge generated to initiate diagnostic methodologies to detect strains and predict their epidemiological behaviour. We have assembled a powerful consortium of partners with proven experimental and industrial achievements. We will (i) systematically examine the properties of field strains and their species barriers when propagated (ii) examine strain-dependent biochemical and biophysical properties of PrPSc (iii) apply novel cryoelectron tomographical techniques to determine the 3-D structure (at 4 nm resolution) of PrPSc in various strains in neuronal (stem) cells (iv) study strain-specific features of prion infection in cultured cells, including their uptake receptors, (v) characterize strain dependent cytopathogenic mechanisms in infected cells. We will prepare novel diagnostic and research reagents such as a) possibly strain specific, PrP monoclonal antibodies, b) a goat PrP transgenic mouse, and c) novel ovine, caprine and bovine neuronal stem cells susceptible to prion infection.",0,0

513,204336,No,Adaptive Nozzle valve system for Solar Water powered desalination,"Solar Water Solutions (SWS) is a company developing solar and wind powered reverse osmosis (RO) water desalination plants for remote islands and locations. In the core of the business is a patented innovation, ANVS technology which enables the use of solar panels or wind turbines without the need of using expensive batteries in RO desalination which is not possible with the current desalination plants. Furthermore, Solar Water Solutions water desalination plant has zero fuel costs and zero CO2 emissions. The business opportunity for Solar Water Solutions in remote islands and locations is potentially over a 100 million € yearly. SWS solution fits small water desalination plant market well. This is a niche in the total fresh water production market. The global water desalination market is expected to grow to 30 billion US$ market in 2025 and experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.8% from 1997 to 2019. The areas which rely on water desalination for fresh water are found in Oceania, the Middle East and Africa. All coastal (or brackish water) areas without municipal and water infrastructure are potential markets. Small communities, islands, resorts, private properties and catastrophic units could use this solution for fresh water supply. Jordan, which practically has no natural sweet water, has 80 million m3 of brackish water available in the Jordan valley. In our case study of a small rural community of 3,000 people, the daily use of sweet water is less than 3 liters per capita. With our approach we could grow it to 10 litres.  The SWS technology is now ready for industrial size pilot testing and the product will be ready for market in Q3/2016. SWS would be the first-to-market with a battery-less solar powered desalination plant.

875,30471,No,Using mobile personal telecommunications innovation for the disabled in umts pervasive integration,"To develop proposals for meeting user requirements for applications and services, usability requirements, non-conventional uses supporting social integration; To specify interfaces, in particular common application programming interfaces, to system services; To develop applications and services, taking account of appropriate HCI; To demonstrate the applications and services in a networked environment, eventually evolving towards UMTS type network, using emerging technology and equipment, adapted where necessary. The project has established through its initial trial the requirements for multimedia applications over mobile networks for the specific domain of people with special needs. From this it will base its developments in the interim phase, (services and applications) with a view to future integration with broadband mobile networks such as UMTS. Within ETSI TC Human Factors the project has initiated two new work items concerned with standardisation of text-telephony (a key service for the deaf) and the further analysis of requirements for mobile video telephony. In its interim phase, the project aims to bring a key contribution to UMTS specifications in the standardisation of protocols and services to support the work on human factors. As the standardisation of the UMTS air interface progresses, the results of the project will encourage the exposure of interfaces and services and related QoS requirements needed to support services for special needs. In parallel with this, the role of IN will be demonstrated together with integration of B-ISDN services. Expected Impact Influence on standards for data communications and mobile networking, thus paving the way towards future UMTS implementation.Establish terminal, services and applications that are accessible to, and usable by, all citizens of the EU.Validate networked multimedia applications for people with special needs.  An explanatory note The name of the UMPTIDUMPTI project is derived from an English nursery rhyme about an egg, Humptidumpti:  Humptidumpti sat on a wall, Humptidumpti had a great fall; All the kings horses and all the king's men, couldn't put Humpti together again  This led us to the image below, the smashed egg, representing the fragmented state of mobile services and the problems of providing for special needs (the egg). Putting the egg together is the task of all contributing into the standardisation of UMTS.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Mobile multimedia services for People with Special Needs combining voice, moving pictures, text or other data streams, integration of the users' environment in the personal communications space, control and monitoring at a distance and security. Contribution to the programme The research work of the project is validated through the demonstration of services and applications developed for the disabled and elderly using existing as well as high-speed mobile communications infrastructure. Technical Approach The objectives will be achieved through trials, demonstrating the optimisation to the mobile environment of existing and new applications for special needs and validating their use for a range of impairments. Workshops will be organised throughout the project in order to present results and to obtain feedback from interested communities. The work will build on already existing results, such as IPNSI and proposals made by the MONET project for example. The IBC infrastructure that evolves during the period of the project will enable these results to be extended further, integrating them with advanced mobile services that will appear as UMTS matures. The role of B-ISDN as the core interconnect with the functions of the Intelligent Network supporting access to specialised services is considered to have major influence on the work. In turn, innovative use of services and protocols in wireless mobile networks will generate input into the standardisation of UMTS, focusing on common service specifications and application programming interfaces. A close involvement in the ACTS consensus process will encourage this cycle of development through direct interaction with other projects assuring early validation of their results. Summary of Trial Three series of trials are planned, with mobile communication infrastructure procured through National Hosts and local services. This programme of trialing is continuous throughout the project's duration and includes: an initial phase to remove speculation about the real issues in supporting special needs and based on existing mobile services; an interim phase to incorporate new technologies and services and further develop the cooperation with other projects; and a final phase, expecting to coincide with the commercial deployment of UMTS and enabling the deployment of applications on UMTS platforms, where acceptability, cost benefit and usability are validated. Key Issues Multimedia - the provision of applications containing text, audio and video as well as conversion between these media and representations optimised for special needs; Quality of service - particularly critical in mobile networks, especially when considering interworking with other networks, e.g Internet, ISDN and PSTN; Security - the authentication of called and calling parties by means appropriate to special needs; Interfaces- service specifications in view of eventual integration into UMTS platforms, protocols, especially for data transfer, application programming interface, ergonomics of terminal design; Value-added services- special applications, or assistance provided by third parties, to improve quality of life for special needs.",0,0
208,18094,No,RESEARCH FOR NEW MAGNETIC MATERIALS TO BE USED IN ELECTRIC MOTORS FOR MOTOR-VEHICLE APPLICATIONS,"To develop new high performance permanent magnets of the type Nd-Fe-B for use in electric motors for vehicular application and for other industrial applications. Specifically, this project concentrates on the permanent magnets to be used in future hybrid electric vehicles (large magnets, high magnetic properties) and advanced car accessories (small magnets, medium magnetic properties).  The project was as follows: the preparation and characterisation of related magnetic alloys, with improved properties and processing, compared to existing ferrite based magnets; the characterisation of the magnetic formulations through a study of the relationship between magnetic microstructure and magnetic properties; the development of magnetic components using new manufacturing systems.  The scientific and technical aims of the project included analysis of the impact of the new magnets on the features of the electric motors, definition of new concepts for the design of such motors and identification of the manufacturing processes of the permanent magnets, suitable for production at industrial level. The technology included: model calculations for determining the optimum geometry and magnetic properties of component magnets; powder metal sintering and melt spinning polymer bonding for the manufacturing process; electrochemical methods and Mossbauer spectroscopy for studying corrosion behaviour and high temperature oxidation kinetics; development of processing routes for Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. Progress has been made in corrosion protection, thermal stability and development of cost effective production processes.  A process has been developed for manufacturing polymer bonded magnets based on the new material neodymium (15) iron (77) boron (8). The received material was crushed and melted under argon. The melt was squirted onto a fast rotating water coled roller can converted into magnetizable ribbons. The ribbons were ball milled into a fine powder and mixed with a phenobic formaldehyde resin in the volume ration 2 to 1. The mixture was moulded at 60 kg cm{-2} and cured by ultrasound with a process time of approximately 10 S. An unrestrained postcuring at 150 C for 3 hours developed the full dimensional stability. The magnets were corrosion protected by a 2 component epoxy lacquer although internal protection through additives in the resin was considered. This process for making polymer bonded magnets is advantageous compared to known processes. The loading of magnetizable material can be much higher than in traditional viscosity limited processes. The process can be fully automated and high productivity can be obtained. The process can be further optimized especially by curing under an applied magnetic field. The corrosion behaviour of neodymium iron boride type magnets with different additives has been investigated using various techniques. THE PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER ELECTRIC MOTOR VEHICLE AND MAGNET INDUSTRIES. THE WORK IS CARRIED OUT IN A NUMBER OF PHASES :   - THE PREPARATION, CHARACTERISATION AND EVALUATION OF RELATED MAGNETIC ALLOYS WITH IMPROVED PROPERTIES AND PROCESSING.  - THE CHARACTERISATION OF MAGNETIC COMPONENTS THROUGH A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAGNET MICROSTRUCTURE AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES.  - NEW ELECTRICAL MOTORS CONCEPTS AND MAGNETIC COMPONENTS SPECIFICATIONS, TO CHECK WITH PRACTICAL TESTING EVALUATION AND SYSTEM ECONOMICS.  - THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAGNETIC COMPONENTS ON THE BASIS OF ECONOMICAL INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.   THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AIMS OF THE PROJECT COVERS THE FOLLOWING AREAS :   - ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE PERMANENT MAGNETS, TYPE ND-FE-B, ON THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICAL FEATURES OF ELECTRIC MOTORS.  - DEFINITION OF NEW CONCEPTS FOR THE DESIGN OF SUCH MOTORS.  - DEFINITION OF THE MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERMANENT MAGNETS.  - IDENTIFICATION OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OF THE PERMANENT MAGNETS SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION AT THE INDUSTRIAL LEVEL.

777,42388,No,Transcriptional regulation by bhlh-pas proteins; a novel family of transcription factors,"Regulation of gene expression under hypoxic conditions is an important feature of many medically very relevant processes. The hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-la mediates transcriptional responses to hypoxia by dimerizing with the transcription factor Arnt. Both HIF-la and Arnt are members of a novel subclass, bHLH-PAS, of the basic helix-loophelix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. Regulation of gene expression by HIF-1 will be examined in detail at two critical steps in the signal transduction cascade: ? Mechanism of conditional regulation of HIF-1, i.e. mechanism of repression and derepression. ? Identification and characterization of co-factors that mediate (or repress) transcriptional activation by HIF-1. Are these factors similar to or distinct from coactivators of members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily? Is the functional communication with these factors by HIF- 1 regulated by hypoxia? More specifically, the domain of HIF mediating hypoxia responsiveness will be identified, and it will be examined if this domain represents a novel ligand binding domain for an as yet unknown class of compounds. Moreover, to understand the mechanism of HIF-1 signaling we will examine if HIF- 1, a putative orphan receptor, recruits a similar battery of transcrptional co-activators as steroid hormone receptors, and whether the already indentified factors, are, in fact, also facilitating transcriptional activation by conditionally regulated bHLH-PAS factors. If this is not the case, novel co-activators will be identified in parallel two-hybrid screens in yeast. The present program aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of conditional regulation of the HIF- I, a potential orphan receptor. These studies will be important for our understanding of the phyisological function of HIF and the mechanism of pathophysiology during hypoxia under a great number of medically very relevant conditions. Moreover, this study represent a critical step in the investigation of the biology of the novel class of bHLH/PAS factors, which, in addition to HIF and the dioxin receptor, includes a number of key developmental factors. The program combines the expertice of the applicant in steroid hormone receptor signaling with a laboratory with a proven track record in bHLH-PAS factor biology, and it is expected to generate results of high impact with regard to our understanding of the biology of this very interesting novel family of putative intracellular orphan receptors Lints with industry / industrial relevance (22)",0,0
86,98862,Yes,Equality without borders? The protection of individuals against EU equality law,"'The first new target for the Europe 2020 Strategy is an employment rate of 75%. The focus is on increasing labour market participation of women, young, older workers and legal migrants. This ambitious political objective must be read in conjunction with a very powerful legal instrument: EU equality law. It for example prohibits discrimination between male and female workers. EU equality law is a most useful tool to increase the competitiveness of European labour markets while reducing inequalities. EU equality law is therefore developing very rapidly, too quickly. The prohibition to discriminate prevents decision-makers from freely making strategic choices: for example the prohibition of age discrimination prevents employers from having a recruitment policy focused on 'young' applicants. Equality law limits individual (economic) freedoms. These negative effects of EU Equality law have not been sufficiently explored and considered by policy makers. This proposal fills this gap: it will suggest safeguards to ensure that the rapid expansion of EU equality law is complemented with adequate protection of individual freedoms. The research will identify the constitutional checks and balances normally required in the rule of law for intervention by a supra-national entity (such as the EU) in individual freedoms. It will then identify the areas of EU equality law that are most restrictive of individual freedoms. Finally, it will draw conclusions on the exact additional institutional guarantees needed to compensate for the limitations placed on individual freedoms by EU Equality law. This will result in suggestions for legislative reform and coherent judicial policy, they are necessary before any further development of EU equality law. The applicant wishes to become an internationally recognised expert on EU equality and constitutional law and to gain access to Dutch Academia. Maastricht Law Faculty will provide expert supervision and excellent career perspectives.'",1,1
686,209053,No,FRAGMENT screening from advanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations on a proteOME scale.,"In Fragment-Based Lead Discovery (FBLD) highly sensitive biochemical and biophysical screening technologies are used to detect the low-affinity binding of low-molecular-weight compounds (the so-called fragments) to biological targets that are involved in pathophysiological processes. Knowledge of the molecular interactions between fragment hit(s) and the target protein allows the rational generation of high-quality leads for drug development. Thus, high-resolution (e.g. X-ray crystallography) and relatively high-throughput structure determination technologies are key to this approach but they can become a limiting factor for both technical and economical reasons. As a matter of fact, when the experimental characterization of binding mode fails, the success rate of FBLD approaches drastically drops. To overcome current limitations in FLBD, here we propose the development of a computational framework based on advanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations to map the binding of fragments to protein surfaces on the proteome scale---thus generating the Fragmentome Altas. For each individual target this will allow to: a) systematically identify fragments binding to protein surfaces and cryptic pockets; b) reconstruct the mechanism of binding with atomistic spatiotemporal resolution; c) characterize the molecular determinants of affinity and kinetics in fragment-protein complexes. This insight is fundamental for optimizing and evolving fragments to lead compounds with desired thermodynamics and kinetics features. To date, neither experimental nor computational approaches can provide such information at affordable costs while maintaining the high throughput needed for screening campaigns. The successful implementation of this ambitious project lies in the unique combination of expertise of its participants, and it will allow a novel state-of-the-art for modern drug discovery to be established. The Fragentome Atlas will be a freely accessible on-line server.",0,0
516,25042,No,"Efficient Use of Parallel Computers: Architecture, Mapping and Communication","Three types of problems of the overall mapping problem are addressed: graph embedding to realize the mapping, the use of the most efficient methods to decrease the influence of the communication, and the study of the properties of interconnection network. These three topics are investigated theoretically and experimentally. The study of embedding is concentrated on multi-dimensional grids, De-Bruijn networks and other fixed degree networks. Communications will be studied under different models, for instance the store-and-forward mode or the circuit-switched mode. Fault-tolerant communication protocols using different faults model are investigated. The complexity of the graph embedding and the communication problem highlights the importance of the underlying network. A network should be of low degree, high regularity, high connectivity and of good extentability. Constructions for networks based on Cayley graphs or compound techniques will be studied. The properties of the important class of multistage networks will be investigated. The existence of disjoint Hamiltonian cycles embedding the binary trees into various networks like toroidal grids in de Bruijn networks was established. A library of mapping algorithms was implemented and integrated into the commercial Parix operating system of Parsytec Computer, Aachen, Germany. Lower and upper bounds on broadcasting in various networks like de Bruijn and shuffle exchange were given. Systolic algorithms for broadcasting, accumulation and gossiping have been developed for various networks. Construction of a family of dense bus networks of diameter 2 has been done.

The governance of cultural diversity is a key issue for contemporary Europe. Accommodating increased cultural diversity by balancing the recognition of differences with the promotion of equal participation in the common public sphere is a task that will, for the foreseeable future, be with us to stay. The proposal will represent a crucial moment for a stronger institutionalisation of the existing collaborations among the partner institutions, giving a systematic character to the transfer of knowledge on the issue of cultural diversity, through methodological workshops, which will clarify definitions and conceptualizations, through the implementation of   comparative research, the implementation of joint courses (Master programs, doctoral studies) and the launching of a scientific journal in English. The comparative research projects implemented will focus on the relations between, on one side, the institutional framework and the governments’ policies, and, on the other, the empirical dynamics of the cultural construction, social formation and political mobilization of collective identities, deployed by migrants, ethno-national minorities, religious minorities, indigenous peoples. The  proposal’s research outcomes will enable a better understanding of the complex dynamics in plural and multi-ethnic societies and may possibly suggest new paths for policies and governance at national and at EU-level.",0,1
113,200113,Yes,Adult Education as a Means for Active Participatory Citizenship,"The existing research and policy reports show that adult education policies and practices are designed and carried out in ways and using means which are not always appropriate to vulnerable minority groups. In the EduMAP Project the diversity of societal participation and the wide range of cultural contexts and communicative practices among learners will be acknowledged. In particular, the educational needs of young people with low levels of basic and functional literacy, with deficient language and cultural skills (foreign newcomers, ethnic minorities), those who have dropped out of school and those not in education or training due to handicap, are in the focus of the project. The main research question is: What policies and practices are needed in the field of adult education to include young adults at risk of social exclusion in active participatory citizenship in Europe?  Through the implementation of six work packages, EduMAP will help European, national and local policymakers, educational authorities and educators to tailor adult education policies and practices to meet the needs of young adults with low levels of education or who are otherwise in a vulnerable position. The project will provide comprehensive analyses and practical insights on the efficacy of the European adult education system in preventing social exclusion and compile an inventory of successful initiatives and communicative practices in and outside the EU. Communicative ecologies in the field of adult education will be mapped and analysed, and the findings will be utilized to create innovative platforms for enhancing dialogue between the providers and potential users of educational initiatives. An IDSS will be developed for the use of policymakers and other stakeholders.

892,224789,No,SOC & Csirt Response to Attacks & Threats based on attack defence graphs Evaluation Systems,"Organisations in Europe face the difficult task of detecting and responding to increasing numbers of cyber-attacks and threats, given that their own ICT infrastructures are complex, constantly changing (e.g. by introduction of new technologies)  and there is a shortage of qualified cybersecurity experts. There is a great need to drastically reduce the time to detect and respond to cyber-attacks, and to enable organisations to structurally stay ahead of the threat. SOCCRATES will develop and implement a new security platform for Security Operation Centres (SOCs) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), that will significantly improve an organisation’s capability to quickly and effectively detect and respond to new cyber threats and ongoing attacks. The SOCCRATES Platform consists of an orchestrating function and a set of innovative components for automated infrastructure modelling, attack detection, cyber threat intelligence utilization, threat trend prediction, and automated analysis using attack defence graphs and business impact modelling to aid human analysis and decision making on response actions, and enable the execution of defensive actions at machine-speed. The SOCCRATES platform will be implemented and deployed at two pilot environments with highly complex and diverse ICT environments and typical application scenarios: an organisation’s internal SOC, and a Managed Security Service Provider. The threat trend prediction component will be deployed at a third pilot environment at which large amount of malicious infrastructure data is collected and analysed. The aim is to exploit the SOCCRATES platform and its components in commercial products.  The SOCCRATES platform and innovative components enables organisations to improve the resilience of their infrastructures and increase productivity and efficiency at the SOC. SOCCRATES’s outcome contributes to a more secure cyberspace and strengthens competitiveness in the EU digital single market.",0,0

At the heart of the JAES is an overtly political relationship and among the features distinguishing JAES from previous Africa-Europe policy initiatives is an associated rolling action plan addressing priority areas for Africa-Europe cooperation. The contribution of scientific and technological research, development and innovation, and the centrality of capacity research for economic and social growth and poverty alleviation, and for addressing global societal challenges of mutual interest is implicit. The value of cooperation between the continents is central and under JAES has already led to significant achievements for mutual benefit. CAAST-Net Plus objectives encourage more and better bi-regional STI cooperation between for enhanced outcomes around topics of mutual interest, and particularly in relation to the global societal challenges of climate change, food insecurity and health. CAAST-Net Plus actions rely on bi-regional dialogue among stakeholders for gathering informed opinion and experience about the bi-regional cooperation process, formulating and disseminating it in such a way as to be admissible to the formal bi-regional STI policy dialogue process and to programme owners. Through informing the bi-regional policy dialogue for mutual learning and awareness, through building support for coordinated and innovative approaches to bilateral funding of bi-regional cooperation around global challenges, brokering the public-private relationship to foster improved uptake and translation of bi-regional research partnership outputs into innovative technologies, good and services, and through dedicated mechanisms to encourage bi-regional research partnerships, CAAST-Net Plus will make invaluable contributions to the quality and scope of the Africa-Europe STI relationship for mutual benefit.",1,1
407,103742,No,Designing Institutions to Evaluate Ideas,"'Not all new ideas are equally valuable from a social perspective. As the readers of this document know all too well, “picking the winners” is challenging because innovations have highly uncertain outcomes.  The aim of this research project is to develop a general theoretical framework to investigate the design of institutions and mechanisms for evaluating new ideas and innovations. The proposed framework examine how these institutions function, draw parallels between them and suggest changes to ensure more accurate evaluation of ideas. Accurate evaluation is of paramount importance because in order for an idea to be successful, it is not enough that the idea be good. It is also necessary that the idea is recognized as good by those who evaluate it.  As the evaluation process becomes more accurate, good ideas are more likely to be funded and incentives for the creation of good ideas are enhanced.  A key contribution of our framework is a characterization of the role played by evaluating institutions in overcoming the inefficiencies resulting from decentralized interaction. These institutions act as intermediaries between innovators and users, and thus are able to redress the market failure resulting when ideas are evaluated in a more decentralized way.  By viewing evaluating institutions through a common lens, we perform a comparative analysis of the workings of such diverse institutions as research funding bodies, government regulators, and screening panels of venture capitalists. With techniques from the economic theory of mechanism design, we intend to characterize the best institutional design for idea evaluation. We then compare this ideal benchmark with actual institutions and characterize how it depends on the primitive ingredients of the environment. Lastly, through empirical and experimental testing, we propose changes to institution design parameters and suggest modifications to the mechanisms created for the purpose of evaluating ideas.'",0,0
793,78819,No,"Public Policy, market organization and transition economies","The aim of this training project is to prepare students for careers in teaching, research or government services and to prepare researchers for active participation in the analysis of the fundamental economic questions facing mixed-market regulated and tra nsition economies. The programme is designed to ensure that students acquire rigorous and state of the art knowledge of core areas of economic theory and research methodology and to offer them research opportunities under close supervision. Instead of sett ing out the theory in an abstract mathematical way, we believe that there is a strong case for reversing the usual order by conveying the concepts of economic theory through the medium of their use and application market regulation and to the problem faced by formerly centrally-planned economies in their transition to the market economy. The proposed project will provide state-of-the-art training in the fields of public policy, industrial organization and transition economics. These fields of modern econom ics are complementary and closely related in several respects. In particular they enjoy a dual status of leading economic fields from an academic point of view and of important sources of guidance for key public policy issues into one of the most interest ing and important areas of economic transition in the world. In addition, their reliance on the same advanced methodology is one of the contributing factors to their suitability for joint advanced training. The fields under consideration provide the intell ectual background and expertise for effective decision-making in such critical areas of public policy as industrial policy, antitrust, regulation, taxation, labor market programs, economic decentralization, and institutional design of transition economies. By providing effective training in the proposed fields with the highest standards to future academic and public sector personnel, this program will make a contribution to the quality of public policy in EU.",0,0
100,209325,Yes,"Tackling early school leaving and low school performance through working with students’ representational spaces. The case of 15 years old students in France, Italy and Greece.","The project explores the question of early school leaving and low performance two of the five EU headlines for education in the Horizon 2020 agenda, addressing the wider societal challenge of employment and social inclusion of young people. The project argues that the theorization of “context” in current state of the art cannot capture the new emerging dynamics caused by globalization and multiple migrations and seeks to establish that students’ “representational spaces” operationalized through their imagined geographies operate as an unidentified and powerful hidden curriculum affecting their educational trajectories and career choices. Towards this purpose, a three step field research will be conducted in three EU countries (France, Italy, Greece). First, the representational spaces of 150 15 years old students, of both urban and rural areas, will be explored through questionnaires and visual methodologies.  Second, a discourse analysis of the national education policy documents will be conducted to investigate the responsiveness of national policies to the change of scale (EU, global). Third, focus groups and interviews will be conducted in order to investigate if changing students’ representational spaces, involves changes in their attitudes towards school and learning. Correlations will be explored and cross-group comparisons will be made to transcend the existing categorization of the state of the art. These objectives will contribute to the better understanding of students’ educational and life paths under the lens of the current sociopolitical and economic dynamics.  The project is anchored on a well structured training scheme and on a strategic communication, dissemination and public engagement plan permitting the maximization of project’s impact.The project deepens the problem of marginalization of young people, sheds light on unidentified ontologies lying in the shadows of the existing conceptual categories and proposes a new language for school pedagogy.",1,1
360,90378,No,Regulation of plant growth by MADS box organ identity genes,"The development of organs in the plant body occurs post-embryonically and can be characterised by three distinct steps. Firstly, the position of future organ primordia must be specified. Subsequently the identity of organs is determined, followed by differentiation and growth of specialised cell types. Although substantial amount of data generated in the past resulted in identification of players involved in each step, the crucial question how organ identity determination is linked to organ growth and differentiation remains to be addressed. Several preliminary observations imply that genes essential for the specification of floral organ identity, namely MADS box transcription factors, might also play important roles in later steps of organ development and growth. Pilot experiments revealed that MADS box transcription factors are expressed during later steps of organ development and are able to interact with proteins involved in the regulation of organ growth, like TCP transcription factors. The main objective of my research will be to characterise the exact function of MADS box organ identity genes in the molecular and cellular processes underlying growth and establishment of final organ size. I intend to focus predominantly on the development of the floral organs sepals and petals in the model species Arabidopsis given their simple structure yet distinct size and identity. I will confirm and identify “late” interaction partners and targets of the MADS box proteins. Furthermore, the role of the identified genes and proteins in the growth process of floral organs will be analysed by achieving time and site specific activation/inactivation. The proposed research will not only substantially contribute to the knowledge about regulation of plant growth, but will also open new horizons in the field of plant development. Detailed characterisation of molecular mechanisms governing flower and hence fruit growth could provide tools for future agricultural applications.",0,0

Understanding and effective use of technologies is essential to effective participation and prosperity A Telework 'Shop Window' During 1997 ETD seeks to further increase the value and use of the website by those who need to reach and engage with the market: suppliers and buyers exemplars and innovators telework associations and other user groups employers and unions policy makers and citizens and to further strengthen the network with partner sites in all European languages and in key international markets. Getting Europe Connected Many individuals who are ready to participate in the Information Society encounter barriers and difficulties. During 1997 ETD seeks to partner with other projects and enterprises to make the first steps easier and more productive for new users. Teletrade Effectiveness Users complain that many European enterprises (and projects!) waste time and resources on websites that are unattractive or even unusable for the audiences they want to attract. Companies investing in websites too often fail to appreciate and respond to the inherently interactive nature of communications and relationship-building on-line, so that their website becomes a costly overhead instead of a revenue generator. During 1997 ETD seeks to codify this feedback into assessment mechanisms and cost effectiveness guidelines that will improve return on investment in websites, on-line marketing and on-line customer services. Broadening Concertation During 1997 ETD seeks to enhance cross-programme concertation initiatives being undertaken through the ACTS Telework Chain (GAT), so as to improve the overall market reach of Information Society initiatives generally and the results-to-cost ratios of individual programmes and projects. Expected Impact European confidence and competence in telework, teletrade and telecooperation is being monitored directly (scale and quality of on-line activity), through status reports from national coordinators, and by analysis of data from Eurostat, OECD, EITO, FAIR and other sources. In 1997 ETD will publish a first consolidated status report and from 1998 an annual progress report. These reports are expected to be of considerable value for researchers, developers, suppliers and users of Information Society products and services as well as in policy making.

Its home website (http://www.eto.org.uk) is the world's most complete and active connection point for telework, as well as a focal point for teletrade and telecooperation. Facilities include: a multiview events calendar a sources and resources database commented and tested links to other relevant sites and services frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers interactive discussion support news and announcement services Available to all the ACTS community and its target audiences, these facilities also support other European programmes and initiatives on an open-to-all basis. A data-driven approach enables any Internet user to add a new event, publication or link to the pool of resources. Communities of Interest ETD stimulates on line working among communities of interest, providing advice, guidelines and sometimes the initial web pages and on-line discussion facilities. Market Development ETD supports activities to increase acceptance and uptake of Information Society technologies. Telework examples in 1997 include: the Commission's Telework 1997 report telework handbooks in multiple languages the flagship Telework97 conference in Stockholm, Sept 24-26 contributions to the European IT Observatory (EITO) European Telework Week, Nov 3-10 The Media ETD partners with NEWSdesk to deliver on-line services to more than 3500 editors and journalists in TV, radio, newspapers and magazines. A library of audio and video clips will further enhance media facilities during 1997. The on-line facilities are complemented by conventional press releases, briefings and interviews. Local language contact points handle responses. ETD participants support a wide range of conferences and seminars. In Member States ETD engages directly with users through national coordinators, who develop and communicate a shared vision in ways appropriate to local cultures and make first hand assessments of grass roots perceptions and realities. The national coordinators are active in national and local Information Society affairs. Summary of Trial The website is a fully operational working testbed for best practice in on-line methods and the practical application of technologies, frequented by tens of thousands of users. ETD uses action research to develop, test and refine enhanced mechanisms for information sharing and telecooperation and can provide a high profile test or demonstration platform for end user or service support applications. Key Issues The main issues being addressed by ETD are: communicating ACTS concepts and Information Society technologies in ways that motivate busy managers, policy makers and citizens overcoming prejudice against the technologies, often caused by fear, uncertainty and doubt but also rooted in real concerns closing the gap with others (notably North America) in awareness, understanding and take up increasing synergy across European programmes, to make them more meaningful to citizens, entrepreneurs and organisations understanding the barriers to acceptance of telework, teletrade and telecooperation understanding the nature and speed of change towards new ways of working  Why synergy across European programmes is essential to develop confidence and competence",0,0

820,31980,No,Development of a cost-effective manufacturing process for a multiparameter disposable sensor microsystem,"- A CMOS-compatible manufacturing process for the targeted sensor microsystem has been developed, which is proven to work in principle. This includes processing of the CMOS front-end, and non-standard sensor specific back-end process modules such as planar structuring of Ag, Pt, Au, Ti and Polyimide on top of the CMOS front-end.  - for the first time, three major electrochemical measurement principles (potentiometric ISFET, amperometric and conductometric) have been integrated on a cost-effective CMOS-compatible microsystem platform, along with signal processing and system control functionality (temperature control, potentiostat, multiplexing, non-volatile memory). In the combination of these measurement principles, it could be shown that any combination of the following analyte classes can be realized very flexibly on the same chip substrate, by just varying dispensed sensitive/selective membranes on top of the ISFET gates or the electrochemical micro-electrodes: - gas partial pressures in fluids, like ph, pO2, pCO2 - electrolyte ions like Ca, K, Na, Cl - other ions like NH4, Nitrate - organic ions / metabolites like Glucose, Lactate, Glutamine, Lactose, Saccharose, Maltose, Galactose - conductivity-characteristic features of fluidic mixtures, like hematocrit  - Ready-to-use wafer-level dispensing equipment for various fluids with leading-edge specifications has been developed, which is scaleable for automated volume production. Positioning accuracy of the systems is better than 10 µm, dispensing of volumes in the nanoliter range on a spot size of 100µm was achieved.  - supporting technology such as housing, assembly, fluid handling circuit, calibration solutions, and some aspects of a sterilization procedure, has been developed in parallel.  - The major remaining risks and problems are: - insufficient yield of the last batch run, such that available sensor wafers would not be suitable for a market introduction. If market exploitation were considered, the process would have to be transferred from IMEC into a commercial fab environment with a suitable quality control infrastructure, and then fine-tuned to increase the yield such that market-compatible prices for the sensor microsystem can be achieved. - a quality-assured and volume-scaleable electroplating process for Ag/AgCl on wafer level still requires major investment. Objectives and content   There is a very high market potential for multiparameter microsensor systems, which are capable of monitoring continuously and on-line important constituents of liquids in a production process, such as partial gas pressures, electrolytes, or metabolites. Process monitoring permits a much faster reaction on a process variation improving quality and reproducibility of the process. There are urgent user needs for such process monitoring devices especially in the biotechnological industry, but also in the food industry. Other highly important fields for monitoring constituents in liquids is health care (monitoring critically ill patients in intensive care units or in the operating room) and environmental measurements (water quality, pollutants). Sensor devices suitable for such monitoring should ideally fulfil these requirements: be small (to be implemented directly in processing equipment, save analyte material), measure many different parameters, and be cheap. Silicon microsensors based on ISFETs (Ion-Selective Field-Effect Transistors) are a very promising technology which fulfils these requirements:  - they have the potential for cheap mass production, using planar thinfilm photolithography technology  - a broad spectrum of measured parameters is possible, all using the same sensing technology  - the sensor elements are very small, they can he integrated in sensor microsystems   The extensive research in this field in the last decade lead to a solid understanding of the functional bases of this sensor technology, and the satisfying performance has been proven in many evaluation studies. But these sensors up to now were only manufactured in scientifically oriented institutions, the costs per sensor are still far beyond a price that allows marketing the sensor. Market acceptance will only he given if the sensor is cheap. The sensor will only be cheap if cost-effective mass-production can be achieved. What is needed today is the transfer of the scientific know-how to the development of a cost-effective high volume production technology. In this project, a sampletaking multiparameter ISFET sensor device, developed by Siemens Corporate R&D, measuring po2, pCo2 and pH, will be used. The major obstacle of a cheap high volume production technology is the current non-compatibility of the technology with industrial CMOS lines. The major goals of the project are:   - redesign of the manufacturing process to be compatible with industrial planar thinfilm production lines.  - implementation of the compatibility with a broad application range during the design phase of the process  - adding further measurement parameters to open up more applications - increase degree of integration in the microelectronics of the sensor, to further decrease the price.    The following achievements are expected after successful completion of the project:   - development of a manufacturing technology for an ISFET based multiparameter sensor microdevice in monolithic integration with CMOS electronics, which closes the gap between scientific manufacturing of single pieces and industrial high volume production by being both cost-cffective and transferable.  - tailoring the manufacturing process for SMEs, since the expected market volume of some million pieces per year is too high for scientifically oriented organisations, but too low for typical mass production lines. - development of cost-optimised microassembly and packaging, including fluid circuit, for the microsensor.  - use the synergetic potential of the microsensor by assuring the applicability in a broad range of applications - to make available to the industry a leading edge technology for process monitoring.",0,0
129,83784,Yes,Social heterogeneity and visibility in urban Europe,"This is a sociological qualitative research focused on how socio-cultural diversity and heterogeneity are created and reproduced in concrete, immediate social action and normative interaction. Relationships of visibility and inter-visibility among social actors are of particular importance in this context. Visibility is at the basis of the production and circulations of social representations and socio-types. Indeed, visibility is a strategic site for understanding the social working of law - at least, when we understand law as the architecture of human interaction.  Once law is seen from a pluralistic point of view as fundamentally behavioural and fundamentally linked to people's commitments, we might start enquiring on issues such as: how is law created and applied to different subjects in different social positions, according to their relative visibility? How does social and cultural diversity emerges and is shaped in these processes? How much does embodied, inescapably visible, difference matter f or legal relationships (classification, discrimination, etc.)?  From this point of view, European cities offer complex environments where visibility mechanisms take place as people moves throughout them. Because of its own peculiar history, each European city creates its places of passage and visibility. The research aims at both raising theoretical questions that interrogate traditional sociology from novel perspectives, and to suggest new directions for future empirical research.",1,1
172,207152,No,Outdoor Lean Elderly Assistant,"The world population is ageing fast. By 2050, the global population of elderly is projected to more than double the size of 2015, reaching nearly 2.1 billion. This growth results in a growing care demand and less people to pay for it. An effective strategy to tackle the challenges of both the expected shortage of caregivers and the ever increasing healthcare expenses is needed. Disruptive innovations, ICT solutions as well as solutions from e.g. the creative sector and robotics can provide a solution to enable the elderly to live independently for longer and promote their health and physical condition.  Studies have shown that promoting physical activity leads to healthier people and cost reductions. Unfortunately, elderly and people with mobility problems need additional care to stay active both indoors and outdoors. Robot Care Systems has found the solution for these people in the OLEA, the Outdoor Lean Elderly Assistant, a robot, disguised as a rollator and mobile scooter in one. The already existing LEA (time to market < a year) has a large number of sensors and sophisticated software solutions, offering balance support, posture correction and assistance in standing up and sitting down and many functionalities accessible through LEA’s touch screen (easy social contact, assistance in care tasks). The new outdoor variant, will additionally stimulate and support physical activities both in- and outdoors, and in general enables elderly to be more independent of care givers and being able to live longer at home. Although preliminary research shows the potential market for the OLEA is large (14% of the general population), the OLEA can result in reducing care with 10 hours/week/patient, resulting in immense economic and social advantages, more detailed market analysis, economic viability research, technical feasibility research and user opinions are required to increase the investor readiness of this product and come up with a detailed business plan.",0,0
567,197091,No,Versatility of scaffold complexes in vivo to control synaptic plasticity,"Receptors and associated scaffolds, together called receptosome, are relatively stable structures, but exchange of individual adaptor proteins can occur on a short time scale and in a highly regulated manner, which provides fine-tuning, speed, and specificity to the receptor signaling. Therefore, understanding how receptor function is affected by the composition and dynamics of complexes is an essential biological concern that will offer the opportunity to target exclusively the therapeutically relevant signaling pathway of a given receptor. We propose that in the brain, receptosome dynamics is involved in fine-tuning synaptic transmission and plasticity, which might be crucial for cognitive functions. First, we will establish the link between molecular events, neuronal signaling and memory performance. More than correlations, this project proposes live recording of molecular events and cellular signaling during memory encoding. Second, new specific therapeutic targets will be proposed for the treatment of cognitive deficiencies: instead of interfering with the ligand-biding pocket of the receptor, we propose to target specific scaffold interactions. This strategy will only modify a specific altered function of a receptor without modifying other functions (thus, avoiding undesired side effects). Third, within the scope of this proposal, we will develop innovative, powerful techniques that will be of high interest for a broad community of researchers in life sciences. These technologies will enable to monitor the versatility of protein-protein interactions in space and time ranging from in cellulo to in vivo BRET imaging in freely behaving animals. To conclude, we will establish the functional significance of oligomer remodeling in the physiological synaptic plasticity and try to restore it in neurological disorders.",0,0
971,46974,No,New automated laser cladding equipment and technique based on high power laser diode,"Today, more and more applications in various industrial branches (transport, tools and more generally mechanics) have important needs in wear resistance. In aerospace, mining, drilling or offshore applications, the parts facing real hard wear conditions are large and are done in resistant ( but expensive) materials. Furthermore the major part of industrial tools used or warn is destroyed and replaced by new ones leading to a considerable amount of raw materials wastes and economical loss. This represents a cost of around 1 billion ECUs per year in Europe. Cladding is wider in its application and includes the protection of parts against corrosion. Cladding also includes the reconstruction of worn out parts with a usual alloy. The laser cladding technique is currently using a CO2 laser combined with a mobile bench which enables an automated process. The main disadvantages of this technique are the size and weight of a CO2 laser cladding equipment, the reflection on metals to be cladded which lead to a considerable energy loss during this process the size of the equipment limits the use only to simple shapes The high power laser diode will improve flexibility in laser cladding thanks to its smaller size, and weight compared to a CO2 one and also because the investment to be made will be lowered. Association of high power laser diode with cladding technique will therefore have positive impact on the following: Initial investment cost will be divided by two: the whole laser cladding equipment price willbelowered clown from tol 000 000 ECUs (equipment and laserCO2) to100 000 ECUs (with the new robot and laser diode). In fact, laser diode has just appeared on the industrial market they are commercially available with a power of 3 kW which enables its use in cladding application. Consequently, our project targets to develop a new automated laser cladding technique based on high power laser diode and consequently improvement of wear characteristics of parts and their possible repairing. This will be done thanks to two developments: - development of optical means to focus the laser beam - development of the linked bench system to automate the cladding operation. Areas if the Brite Euram workprogramme covered by this proposal are the following: Applications of appropriate automation, intelligent assembly, mechatronics and microsystem technologies to improve cleanliness, reliability, repeatability and control of production processes, and to replace repetitive, tedious, and dangerous functions, while optimising the use of human labour. New systems will take into consideration the suitability of the working environment and enable the application of new production approaches including technologies for new methods of construction. Other areas covered by the proposal: 1. l.7.M :Development of new and improved production systems able to provide increased speed and accuracy of cutting, forming, rolling, casting, shaping, welding, surface treatment machining and other manufacturing operation. 2.1.3.M:Environmentally compatible surface engineering, coating (both organic and inorganic) and joining technologies to improve durability, performance, and functionality (e.g. physical, chemical and biochemical characteristics).",0,0
625,199461,No,Statistical modelling across price and time scales: a quantitative approach to modern financial regulation,"This project aims at providing a new quantitative approach to financial regulation, notably in the context of high frequency trading. The key idea of our method is to build relevant statistical models through price and time scales, connecting the microstructure of financial markets to the long term behavior of prices.  Doing so, we will be able to understand and quantify the macroscopic consequences of regulatory measures modifying the microscopic design of the market. Succeeding in this modelling task will require to address several intricate statistical problems.  In particular new results will be needed in the fields of limit theory for semi-martingales, multifractal processes, rough stochastic differential equations, Hawkes processes and high-dimensional statistics. Hence, through this project, we not only have the hope to provide groundbreaking tools for worldwide regulation of financial markets but, concurrently, to answer important and challenging mathematical problems. In term of analyzing concrete regulatory measures, particular attention will be devoted to the issue of the choice of a proper tick value, that is the minimal price increment allowed on a financial market. Indeed, the tick value is the tool which seems to be favored by most policy makers in order to regulate high frequency trading.",0,0
109,212248,Yes,"Refugees are Migrants: Refugee Mobility, Recognition and Rights","This project begins with the basic premise that refugees are migrants: by legal definition and political conception, they have left their home countries to seek refuge.  This project aims to re-assess refugee protection through a lens of mobility and migration, locating the study of refugee law in the context of the refugee regime.  It examines the three key aspects of refugee law – access to protection, refugee status determination, and refugee rights – bringing them into conversation with the refugee regime’s norms and practices on responsibility-sharing and solutions. Crucially, the project takes a long and broad view of refugee protection, in order to open up new possibilities and trajectories.     It also integrates a legal assessment of the role of non-state actors in refugee protection.    Using the broad notion of ‘intermediary’ in the migration process, it will assess the regulatory environment on access to protection, so-called ‘secondary movement’ and onward migration.  It will provide an important legal assessment of the role of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the duties of humanitarian actors in refugee protection.    It addresses the EU, not as a singularity, but as an actor in the global regime.  The project is methodologically ground-breaking.   It identifies practices that determine access to and the quality of refugee protection, and how these practices have developed across jurisdictions and over time, thereby historicizing and reframing the practices in question. As well as rigorous doctrinal (‘black letter’) legal analysis, it will use go beyond doctrine, and draw on theoretical conceptions of legality to explore the particular modes of regulating mobility and migration that are now central to refugee protection.  It will also develop new inter-disciplinary methods, using comparative legal, historical and political-scientific tools.",1,1
712,219233,No,Memory Across Borders: Dealing with the Legacy of Disputed Territories,"DisTerrMem is an integrated programme of training and mobility opportunities for researchers and non-academic partners, who will co-create an innovative transnational, interdisciplinary and multi-level approach to the pressing problem of managing competing memories of disputed territories across borders. Taking an interdisciplinary collaborative approach, the planned secondments and training will share and extend interdisciplinary knowledge. Methods to share knowledge will include cross-disciplinary seminar series, the co-production of literature reviews and a shared methodological and theoretical framework, the organisation of internal conferences and summer schools, the production of jointly-authored academic publications, as well as an international conference. These activities will facilitate the co-creation of a new theoretical and methodological approach to a significant problem. Dealing with competing and often antagonistic memories of disputed territory remains a pressing challenge not just within the EU, but globally. However, the solution to such tensions is not necessarily the formulation of a ‘shared’ memory of such territories, which in any case may prove difficult to achieve. As a recent report of the European Parliament (2013: 5-6) notes, while historical memory is already disputed at the national level, beyond the national frame ‘the perception of the past proves all the more heterogeneous and problems for having a collective memory or even defining common historical landmarks are multiplied.’ Researchers on this project will receive the training necessary for them to address the challenge of managing competing memories of disputed territories in three key regions (Europe, South Asia and the South Caucasus), producing insights into best practice that will be useful to policymakers at the national and supranational level, to civil society groups and to cultural practitioners.",0,0
416,26775,No,Evaluating the potential for bambara groundnut as a food crop in semi-arid Africa,"This multidisciplinary research programme will link field experiments in Botswana and Tanzania with controlled-environment experiments and analysis at the Universities of Nottingham and Wageningen. Within three years the project will assess the food potential of bambara groundnut, an under-utilized legume crop indigenous to Africa.  Contrasting field sites in Botswana and Tanzania will provide a range of rainfall and soil environments in which the growth, development and yield of bambara groundnut genotypes will be measured over three field seasons. Results from the field experiments in Africa will be combined with research at Nottingham and Wageningen to develop a robust model of bambara groundnut. A preliminary version of the model will be produced within the first year of the project and during the second year, data from the field experiments will be incorporated in order to refine and adjust the model. Data from the final field season will be used to test whether the model can reasonably predict the yields of contrasting bambara groundnut genotypes in different tropical regions. The model will also determine the sensitivity of yield to genetic and environmental factors.  The project will identify agroclimatic regions, sustainable agronomic strategies which do not require high levels of fertilizers and pesticides, and research priorities for bambara groundnut.  The experience gained and the research procedures followed during the project will be used to develop a general methodology for assessing the potential of a wide range of under-utilized crops.

132,30534,Yes,Forecast and assessment of socio-economic impact of advanced communications and recommendations,"To support the ongoing impact assessment and forecasting of global developments (encompassing political, regulatory, strategic, industrial, service provision, application, tariffing, and technical issues) affecting the development of advanced communications in Europe. More specifically: to assess and analyse the impacts of global developments in advanced communication in Europe and outside Europe on the work in the ACTS programme; to assess the continued relevance and likely impact of ACTS work; to produce a major contribution on this basis to the strategic audit of advanced communications development and subsequent Impact Assessment and Forecast reports on a yearly basis. FAIR aims to support the Commission action in directing and managing ACTS and ensuring its ability to reach its goals. It is also providing relevant information and input to programme participants. FAIR will also distribute widely information and interact with external parties, through workshops and publications aimed at specific targets, thereby increasing awareness of the advanced communication potential benefits and of the relevance of ACTS programme work. Expected Impact Research and technology development initiatives are needed to build European capabilities in producing and using advanced communication technologies and services. Without such initiatives, Europe is likely to lag behind developments in other parts of the world and miss opportunities for businesses and citizens to participate in the benefits of the Information Society. Policy choices must be made to shape the social and economic impacts of advanced communication technologies and services. FAIR aims to point out specific initiatives and policies for enhancing the contribution of the ACTS Programme and improving its contribution to the European Information Society. The scenarios developed by FAIR in its first year of work and presented in June 1996 point out that there are different possible trajectories to the Information Society, and not all of them guarantee the best possible outcomes in terms of reducing social inequality and supporting diffused welfare. In the medium term, up to 2003, infrastructure and service diffusion is likely to be dominated either by Incumbents (Public Telecom operators, Cable TV operators, allied with audio-visual companies) or by Insurgents (newcomers from the information technologies world, such as Microsoft, and others) resulting in a stronger development of mass market consumer services and services aimed to large business. Market forces in these scenarios are likely to focus on higher income users and more developed regions. The best chance for a balanced economic growth and the reduction of social exclusion lies instead with a third scenario, called the Virtual Community Renaissance. This scenario implies a full exploitation of liberalisation through widespread and open access to infrastructures and services, and the blossoming of a variety of service and content providers from all sectors, with an active role of the education and social services sectors. Developments in the past months broadly confirm this view, but the most important event is the ever growing impact of the Internet and the WWW growth on suppliers strategies and markets development, which seems strengthening the Insurgents. Incumbents strategies appear to be largely defensive. Opportunities for the Virtual Communities constituency, strongly identified in 1996 Main Report with the Internet community, appear to be influenced by the problems of network development, uncertainty in critical security and privacy protection issues, particularly relevant for SMEs use of the Internet. The ACTS programme can play an important role in these developments, by building European technological capabilities, by encouraging participation of new content and service providers in its activities, by involving SMEs as much as possible in its advanced communications trials, by paying special attention to SMEs and professionals interests in its work on standards, security, quality, privacy and interconnection issues.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Impact assessment & forecasting of global developments in advanced communications Contribution to the programme High impact of scenarios and results including input to G7/8 meeting in Ottowa Technical Approach This project views technological developments as one component of a complex socio-political, economic and technical system that is characterised by mutual interdependencies. The project FAIR provides a multi-disciplinary approach designed to bridge the gap between the expectations of technical experts and the constraints and opportunities in the socio-economic environment. In particular, project FAIR produces and disseminates a series of working papers addressed to a wide range of targeted groups and individuals and focused on major socio-economic issues such as employment and new job creation, universal service and consumer aspects, sustainable development, regional development and SMEs access (and barriers) to advanced communications services and technologies. produces a yearly Main Report, a comprehensive summary of results and recommendations derived from a detailed analysis of major socio-economic issues and policy impact scenarios under three main aspects: (a) socio-political and techno-economic analysis; (b) technical infrastructure and service trends analysis; (c) socio-economic impacts of advanced communications' analysis. monitors the ACTS Programme in order to assess the contribution of the Programme with respect to the socio-economic impact of broadband advanced communications (ATM) in Europe. FAIR can be met on the WWW, at the following address: http://www.analysys.co.uk/acts/fair/  Summary of Trial FAIR is not an R&D project. However, ACTS programme participants and external experts can be identified as 'users' in a broad sense of the project output. The planned validation and feedback via electronic networks of the structured results of ACTS monitoring, and of the ACTS-SEP Matrix scenarios by the international experts networks, can be defined as a trial of the projects results. Key Issues If the ACTS Programme is to be a foretaste of the future, the social, political, cultural and economic consequences of advanced communication services must be positive on balance, engaging public interest and support. Positive consequences include the potential for strengthening European competitiveness, regional development and employment while increasing social cohesion and enhancing the social and cultural environment of Europe. Negative impacts to be overcome include reconciling divergent producer and supplier interests, reducing access inequalities, and building public confidence in the Information Society.",0,1
48,206131,Yes,Social Investment Perspective in Work-Family Reconciliation Measures in Europe and East Asia,"This project aims to explore the effects of social investment perspective on women and to identify effective work-family reconciliation measures in fostering social inclusion of women in the labour market and family. It adopts a mixed method approach to compare the social investment perspective in the work-family reconciliation measures in five European and two East Asian countries (Sweden, Germany, Hungary, the UK, France, Hong Kong and South Korea); and examines its relationship with women’s participation in the production and reproduction spheres. Systematic comparison of policy designs with the aid of country based policy grids, statistical analysis under the economic defamilisation index and state-led care-focused defamilisation index, semi-structural interviews with policy experts, secondment in non-academic organisations and dissemination activities will be conducted. Against the backdrop of the Lisbon Agenda and Horizon 2020, the social investment perspective has become a new social policy paradigm in Europe. It stresses on investing in human capital development, making efficient use of human capital and fostering social inclusion. It shares similarities with the productive approach in some East Asian countries which is regarded as important to economic success. This project will enhance the researcher’s comparative social research skills and cross-regional knowledge on related policies; add value to the hosting university’s leadership in international social policy study; promote knowledge transfer between the two regions; and derive policy suggestions on social inclusion of women in the labour market and family. It is built on the expertise of the supervisor and the researcher on welfare policies in Europe and East Asia; and will be an integral part of the work plan of the interdisciplinary East Asian Social Policy Research Network and Social Policy Cluster of the hosting University. This is a project to be considered by the Reintegration Panel (RI).",1,1
950,220672,No,Globalized Memorial Museums.Exhibiting Atrocities in the Era of Claims for Moral Universals,"The ‘universalization of the Holocaust’ has established the Shoah as an historical reference point legitimizing a global moral imperative to respect human rights. Much has been written about the ostensible ‘globalization of memory’, but as yet no genuinely global comparative study systematically confronting this hypothesis with the actual representations of atrocities exists. GMM breaks new ground by examining memorial museums on four continents, arguing that what is called ‘globalization’ in fact comprises three to some degree contradictory trends: 1) The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem are role models for a universal moral orientation that focuses on the individual victim and generates aesthetic ‘standards’ for musealization. 2) The German concept of negative memory, self-critically confronting the crimes committed by her own population, has inspired museums to tackle the question of one’s own complicity in order to challenge collective self-victimization and the externalization of responsibility. 3) The genocides of the 1990s led to a ‘forensic turn’: the investigation of bones & other material evidence of atrocities has changed the way in situ memorial museums deal with material traces of violence. This shift has also impacted ‘old’ memorial sites like Sobibor, which has become a site of archaeological research after 70 years. GMM examines 50 memorial museums dealing with - the WWII period in the US, Israel, Europe, China, and Japan; - recent genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Scholars claim that ‘globalized’ memorial museums reflect new moral standards and a new language of commemoration, but what is the price of the attendant de-contextualization in the name of moral universals? GMM’s wholly original global typology of memorial museums has the potential to act as a genuine game changer that challenges the concept of ‘universal memory’ and the notion that memorial museums constitute a globalized space of communication and negotiation.",0,0
481,98752,No,Single-molecule junction capabilities to map the electron pathways in redox bio-molecular architectures,"This proposal presents a novel methodology to explore the mechanisms of different electron pathways in redox bio-molecular architectures at the single-molecule level. Single-molecule contacts have been shown to be experimentally realizable at room temperature.  Scanning Probe Microscopies are the most employed techniques for creating contacts due to the high spatial resolution. A huge variety of molecular systems has been already explored bringing a more robust understanding of the critical parameters required to build and measure charge transport through single-molecule devices; stable molecule-electrode chemical binding, univocal detection of a single-molecule contact formation or the elucidation of the effect on charge transport by different chemical groups. Single-molecule junctions with more complex bio-molecular systems are less explored but their feasibility has been already demonstrated on well-know structures like DNA or alpha-helices. Sulfur-content chemical groups are targeted in these systems to allow long-lived electrical contacts to the metal electrodes. Here we propose to use the above methodologies to achieve a complete picture of the electron pathways on an individual bio-molecular redox structure. Different electron pathways can be selected by forming single-molecule junctions at different positions of the outer shell of the protein structure. Site-directed mutagenesis can be used for creating the specific sites. A step further in this project will be to explore the dominant parameters involved in the sequential-step hopping electron transfer (ET). Such a study will provide clues for the understanding of the structural effects on the long-range ET in living organisms. This proposal assures a novel pioneering research particularly designed for the present host institution specialized in Biochemistry to be led by an expert researcher in the field of Molecular Electronics.",0,0

Using the same voice for every application is not acceptable to users.<br/>But creating a speech synthesiser for a new language or domain is too expensive, because current technology relies on labelled data and human expertise. Systems comprise rules, statistical models, and data, requiring careful tuning by experienced engineers.<br/>So, speech synthesis is available from a small number of vendors, offering generic products, not tailored to any application domain. Systems are not portable: creating a bespoke system for a specific application is hard, because it involves substantial effort to re-engineer every component of the system.

783,78123,No,G@me,"In the year 2004 over half of the Western European population will be online. A generation of children and young people, the so-called 'Generation @', grow up in a new multimedia environment with mobile phones, interactive devices, digital TV and new forms of interactive entertainment. The proposed High- Level Scientific Conference, 'Generation @ in Multimedia Environments (G@ME)' shall focus on social, cultural and economic aspects of interactive entertainment for children and young people in Europe.  The main objectives are:  - With regard to Interactive Entertainment a clear generational gap is to be observed. Many academics do not pay attention to a phenomenon that never became a relevant part of their own lives. It seems that it needs a generation of academics that have grown up with computer and video games. The Workshop sets out to involve young researchers who belong to this generation.   - Interactive Entertainment has to be analysed from different disciplinary perspectives. Social, economic, cultural and educational perspectives have to be integrated in order to reach a comprehensive understanding of this field. The Workshop shall bring together scholars from media and communication studies, economic psychology and education.   - Current developments in interactive entertainment raise the question of cultural identity or cultural dominance. Successful computer games, most of them being produced in the U.S.A. or in Japan (e.g. EA, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft), are global phenomena which go far beyond the games market itself. Instead they shape the whole range of cultural symbols making up children' s and young peoples ' environments. Thus, the proposed Workshop will include an intercultural comparative perspective.  - The markets of interactive entertainment are developing quite fast. As a rule, the development of technology and content is far ahead of scientific research. In order to further the exchange between these two spheres, the proposed Workshop shall include academics as well as representatives of the industry.  - With interactive entertainment becoming a core element of young people's media environments, this field earns increasing attention with regard to the debates on media education and media literacy and on a 'User friendly Information Society'. This aspect is particularly important against the background of substantial differences between genders and social groups in whether and how they make use of new technologies. The contributions to the proposed Workshop will pay particular attention to these questions.",1,0
57,82641,Yes,No Longer Researching About Us Without Us,"As a research project 'Nothing about us without us' is based on the values of belonging, equality, and respect. These values are at the core of the concept of equal opportunity and full participation of people with learning disabilities in their quest for inclusive lives. The project responds to the criticism made by members of disabled groups that in the past research has succeeded in doing things to people with disabilities rather than including them in the setting of the research agenda.  This latter approach has been described by the Incoming International Fellow as inclusive research. This project has four main aims and will work in an inclusive/participatory manner with a group of 15 participants with learning disabilities and five without as well as a reference group of interested stakeholders. The four stages of the project will cover participants undertaking a professional development course on inclusive research that leads to accessible outcomes for all involved; then implementing inclusive re search projects focussed upon the participants lives, such as, oral histories; followed by implementing inclusive research projects in collaboration with local agencies and community groups within Ireland; and finally setting up inclusive research networks between Ireland and across the European Union.",1,1

Summary of the project  SPEECH supports the development and implementation of legislative actions by the Commission where safety and environmental protection is at stake. The project operates the well-established 'European Pressure Equipment Research Council' (EPERC), which performs Research and Development activities and in particular pre-normative and co-normative research needed to assist the development of harmonised standards useful for EU legislation. Considerable support is given to the implementation of the EC Directive on Pressure Equipment (PED 97/23/CE) that will become mandatory in member states in May 2002. With its 195 signatory organisations of industries, research institutions, inspection and governmental bodies, EPERC is fostering collaborative research, ensuring technology transfer (particularly towards SMEs) and liasing with the services of the Commission and CEN (Comité Européen de Normalisation) for the design, the manufacture and the safe operation of new pressure equipment to be placed on the market.  In 2002 SPEECH will address two new initiatives relevant to other EU policies and in particular related to the recent communication on alternative fuels for road transportation and on a set of measures to promote the use of bio fuels:  - the promotion of the use of alternative fuels for the transport sector, in particular in the field of safety of energy storage systems. Motivated by air quality concerns, alternative fuels (natural gas, bio fuels, hydrogen for fuel cells) attract considerable interest as a way to reduce urban pollution. SPEECH includes R&D activities and implementation of testing facilities for fuel storage tank technologies, a key issue for the development of vehicles powered by these fuels. - measures for the implementation of infrastructures required for safe and efficient distribution and transmission of those clean alternative fuels in order to assure their availability.  Rationale  The implementation of the Pressure Equipment Directive (PED 97/23/CE) as well as its improvement is requiring harmonised standards for pressure equipment design, manufacture and safe operation. In addition, several nuclear manufacturers are following the PED for selected nuclear reactor components (class 2 and 3). The major concern here is the harmonisation of national legislation with regard to the free movement of pressure equipment in order to ensure personal safety and health protection. The European Union also needs a coherent and consolidated policy to deal with industrial risk management. Monitoring the detrimental effect of Hydrogen in large and heavy chemical facilities (gas pipelines, Hydro crackers) is one important issue. Additionally, and in the short term, the EU is committed under the Kyoto Protocol, to achieving an 8% reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 compared to the 1990 level. The transport sector accounts for close to 30% of total CO2 emissions in the EU and a major growth of up to 40% is forecast for 2010. Therefore, research is needed on alternative fuels (Hydrogen, natural gas, bio fuels) offering low or zero carbon emissions. This includes the study of fuel storage technologies providing the automotive and transport industry with reliable information on the design of on-board energy storage, upstream of the fuel cell. EPERC provides this added value by conducting relevant scientific research and development to support the implementation of EU legislations.",0,0
253,111544,No,Algorithms and Lower Bounds: A Unified Approach,"One of the fundamental goals of theoretical computer science is to understand the possibilities and limits of efficient computation. This quest has two dimensions. The theory of algorithms focuses on finding efficient solutions to problems, while computational complexity theory aims to understand when and why problems are hard to solve. These two areas have different philosophies and use different sets of techniques. However, in recent years there have been indications of deep and mysterious connections between them.  In this project, we propose to explore and develop the connections between algorithmic analysis and complexity lower bounds in a systematic way. On the one hand, we plan to use complexity lower bound techniques as inspiration to design new and improved algorithms for Satisfiability and other NP-complete problems, as well as to analyze existing algorithms better. On the other hand, we plan to strengthen implications yielding circuit lower bounds from non-trivial algorithms for Satisfiability, and to derive new circuit lower bounds using these stronger implications.  This project has potential for massive impact in both the areas of algorithms and computational complexity. Improved algorithms for Satisfiability could lead to improved SAT solvers, and the new analytical tools would lead to a better understanding of existing heuristics. Complexity lower bound questions are fundamental but notoriously difficult, and new lower bounds would open the way to unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols and derandomization of probabilistic algorithms. More broadly, this project aims to initiate greater dialogue between the two areas, with an exchange of ideas and techniques which leads to accelerated progress in both, as well as a deeper understanding of the nature of efficient computation.",0,0
936,206354,No,Cross-layer modEl-based fRamework for multi-oBjective dEsign of Reconfigurable systems in unceRtain hybRid envirOnments,"ICT is embedded and pervasive into our daily lives. The notion of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has emerged: embedded computational collaborating devices, capable of controlling physical elements and responding to humans. The Cross-layer modEl-based fRamework for multi-oBjective dEsign of Reconfigurable systems in unceRtain hybRid envirOnments (CERBERO) project aims at developing a design environment for CPS based of two pillars: a cross-layer model based approach to describe, optimize, and analyze the system and all its different views concurrently; an advanced adaptivity support based on a multi-layer autonomous engine. To overcome the limit of current tools, CERBERO provides: libraries of generic Key Performance Indicators for reconfigurable CPSs in hybrid/uncertain environments; novel formal and simulation-based methods; a continuous design environment guaranteeing early-stage analysis and optimization of functional and non-functional requirements, including energy, reliability and security. CERBERO effectiveness will be assessed in challenging and diverse scenarios, brought by industrial leaders: an embedded CPS with self-healing capabilities for planetary explorations (TASE-S&T), an ocean monitoring CPSoS (AS), and a Smart Travelling CPSoS for Electric Vehicle (TNO-CRF-S&T). CERBERO will automate multi-objective decisions to meet requirements and correct/optimized–by–construction designs. Interoperable components (i.e. DynAA by TNO, AOW by IBM, PREESM by INSA, PAPI-ARTICo3 by UPM, MDC by UniCA-UniSS) will be enhanced with additional features (as security, USI), mostly released as open-source to foster open innovation and a real path to standardisation, and integrated (IBM- AI) into a unique framework. Design speed up (one order of magnitude), increased performance (30% less energy) and reduced costs of deployment (by rapid prototyping and system in the loop incremental design) and maintenance (by runtime verification and adaptivity) of CPSoS are expected.",0,0
648,195194,No,Enacting heritage: The aesthetic dynamics of cultural transmission,"Aesthetic behaviours and expressive activities carry out a crucial role in human cultural evolution. Aesthetic cognition is important for intersubjective attunement already in early childhood, and attends to cultural emergence and transmission of ideas, practices and norms. However, anthropological scholars haven't ever investigated the cognitive dynamics whereby aesthetic behaviours shape the symbolic processes of constitution and re-enactment of cultural heritage. The proposed research project seeks to address this lacuna by dealing with key issues relating to the role of aesthetic behaviours in cultural transmission. The study focuses on how aesthetic and expressive elements are mobilized in the course of social interaction creatively transforming and communicating knowledge. The originality of the proposed approach lies in the interdisciplinary methodology that has not been used in previous studies of the subject matter. For the first time, a naturalistic and cross-cultural model of aesthetic behaviour will be applied to the context of cultural evolution. Existing naturalistic studies of aesthetics are characterized by a reductionist approach, whereas research on cultural transmission suffers due to the divide between cultural and evolutionary perspectives. This project aims to overcome the traditional opposition of “evolutionary psychology versus ethnography” through an interdisciplinary study of the multimodal, expressive, symbolic, and non-verbal practices whereby human beings collectively perform and share knowledge. The principal result of the project will be the first systematic and comparative analysis of aesthetic behaviours as operative components of cultural transmission. This result will be of interest to a broad scientific audience and will enhance several branches of European research and education, including aesthetics, cultural evolution, anthropology of art, and cultural heritage, by combining research methods derived from different disciplines.",0,0
386,198545,No,THE NANO EYE DEVICE,"The project, named NED (Nano Eye Device), hereinafter referred as “NED”, aims at developing a fully automated, small size, lightweight, self-powered and portable optical system for imaging at micro/nano dimensional range, with a field of view between 0,5 millimeters down to a pixel size of 50 nanometers. NED is automated in XYZ axis movement and has a two-way (input/output) interface, via LAN connectivity (USB backup connection anyway available), with any portable (and/or desktop) device, like tablets, smartphones, HDMI TVs screens and PCs. Traditional optical microscopes aren’t able to operate at nanometric level, so NED can operate in the area between low cost traditional microscopes and bigger, more costly and very sophisticated laser microscopes. Thanks to an innovative patented optical-laser coupling, NED will be able to record pictures and videos even at nanoparticles size level, from any biological (and non biological) sample put on a standard microscope glass coverslip. So it can be profitable used with optical biosensor for virus detection. The captured data will be then made available in real-time to any external imaging device over any TCP/IP data network, locally and remotely (live imaging). Thanks to its internal micro-computer, NED is a powerful portable device, thus representing a key enabling technology (KET) for anyone working on clinical microscopy and optical biosensors, for example thanks to the possibility to quickly and easily display specific parameters. NED’s flexible and simplified design also offers the possibility to adapt its micro and nanometric visualization capabilities to several different industry and market applications, including on-line monitoring of biological processes, pharmaceutical sector, micro-nanocode based counterfeiting applications, food certification and traceability quick visual inspection of biological samples either in “outdoor” (i.e. first-aid) or in “strategic” (i.e.: bioterrorism prevention) environments.",0,0
300,105793,No,Therapies for inborn errors of metabolism,"We discovered that phenylbutyrate, prevents both in vitro and in vivo the inactivation by phosphorylation of the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). We show that phenylbutyrate is effective for treatment of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) due to deficiency of branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), and has potential for therapy of deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). We propose to investigate phenylbutyrate for PDHC deficiency in a zebrafish model and in PDHC-deficient patients. We have recently developed a systems biology tool for prediction of drug mode of action starting from their gene expression profiles. This tool has a significant potential for drug discovery and repositioning. Through this approach, we found several FDA-approved drugs sharing with phenylbutyrate a similar mode of action. We propose to investigate the efficacy of these drugs for increasing the enzymatic activity of both BCKDC and PDHC and their therapeutic potential. While useful for proof-of-concept studies animal models are not suited to predict patient response to drugs which depends upon multiple factors including type of mutation and affected enzyme subunit. We propose to develop PDHC deficient neurons and MSUD hepatocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients’ fibroblasts. Drug response in these disease-relevant cell types will better predict clinical response of patients. Human iPSCs will be generated through a novel system based on high cloning capacity, non-integrating helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector expressing a combination of reprogramming factors. We will investigate altered metabolic pathways in PDHC deficient neurons and MSUD hepatocytes to search for effective drugs by an innovative systems biology approach. In summary, the results of the proposed study have the potential to provide novel and effective treatments for MSUD and PDHC deficiency.",0,0
600,217533,No,"Genetics of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) in children, and the childhood predictors of adulthood MHO and MUNW","Background: Recent large-scale genomic studies have provided evidence that a number of genetic variants implicate an inverse relationship between increased adiposity and an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile. So far, it is not known whether the loci showing “favorable adiposity”-like associations exert their influence already in childhood.  Objectives: The aims of the project proposed are 1.The identification of gene variants associated with increased adiposity yet a favorable cardiometabolic profile in children and adolescents and  2. Identification of the childhood genetic and environmental predictors of adult metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW).  The approach: To study, whether such “favorable adiposity” genetic effects are found already in childhood, I will perform a meta-analysis of six child populations from Finland, Denmark and England including a total sample size of 10,038 children and adolescents aged 3-18 years.  To examine associations of childhood genetic and environmental factors with MHO and MUNW in adulthood, I will utilize follow-up data from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study.  The impact: Identification of MHO and MUNW related genetic variants in children and the childhood predictors of adult MHO and MUNW will help to assess the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease as well as to target interventions in the high-risk groups. The ability to improve advice and intervention measures would help alleviate the burden of obesity-related comorbidities on health care systems worldwide. Moreover, this project will allow me to learn highly valuable research skills in the area of genetics and meta-analyses related to cardiometabolic risk factors and support my professional and research advancement.",0,0
307,81745,No,Social representations in action and construction in Media and Society: European Ph.D. on social representations and communication international lab Meetings,"The European PhD on Social Representations and Communication International Lab Meetings, successor to the decade of International Summer Schools, provides an important opportunity for young researchers to obtain advanced academic and technical skills needed to conduct state-of-the-art research. Twelve ten days-long courses are organised around the theme of Social Representations in Action and Construction in Media and Society and focus on advanced practical training for 25 participants.  The first two events each year integrate virtual and face-to-face sessions, aimed at training doctoral students in meta-theoretical analysis of the literature. The following one is face-to-face intensive training courses requiring the physical mobility of participants and op en to long-term dissemination via web. These events share common objectives and have a didactic structure with multiple training opportunities for critical analysis of the link between multi-media communication systems and social representations. The methods, techniques, software packages and related method theory guiding applications in research design, will provide the unifying theme for each event of the proposed advanced courses.  The topics developed in the participants' research projects presented and discussed during the workshops will provide a variety of societal issues mediated and constructed via traditional and new media. The program's originality is in its training methods, integrating face-to-face interaction (workshops, lectures, presentations) with mediated virtual interaction (Internet forum discussion, web-videoconferencing, streaming videos). Key lectures expand the horizon to other communication fields (semiotics, linguistics, sociology, mass communications, media studies etc.).  The phenomena we cover (information society, new socialization and communication strategies and applications for politics, health, the environment, social minorities, gender, etc.) are clearly relevant to EU policy.",0,0
884,199843,No,Innovative Dermatology Healthcare based on Label-Free Spectral Optoacoustic Mesoscopy,"Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) brings a revolution to bio-optical imaging. Being insensitive to photon scattering, MSOT dramatically improves upon conventional bio-optic barriers by enabling (1) three-dimensional high-resolution optical imaging deep inside tissues (several millimetres to centimetres), by (2) high-scalability, ranging from optical-resolution microscopy to acoustic-resolution optical mesoscopy and macroscopy and by (3) novel label-free anatomical, physiological and molecular contrast at the tissue and single-cell-level, based on spectrally-resolved optical absorption. MSOT, originally supported by an ERC Advanced Award (2008) (TUM: Prof. Ntziachristos), is already commercialized by iThera Medical for macroscopy with systems sold around the world for small animal imaging. In parallel, ERC MSOT funding developed a mesoscopic implementation, termed raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM), which has demonstrated innovative imaging capacity at 1-5mm depths.  Driven by leading dermatologists (TUM: Prof. Biedermann; SUR: Prof. Costanzo) and market leader SMEs in optoacoustic and ultrasound technology (iThera, Rayfos, Sonaxis), INNODERM will design and prototype a handheld, portable, scalable, label-free RSOM device for point-of care dermatology applications, based on recommendations developed under an ERC proof of concept grant (2013) on MSOT. INNODERM brings together key photonic & ultrasound technologies and will validate the technical and economic viability of RSOM in dermatology suites for fast diagnosis and skin disease monitoring. RSOM can go beyond the abilities of current optical or optoacoustic devices and offer a paradigm shift in dermatology imaging, substantiating successful business cases.",0,0
500,199862,No,STREAMLINE,"STREAMLINE will address the competitive advantage needs of European online media businesses (EOMB) by delivering fast reactive analytics suitable in solving a wide array of problems, including addressing customer retention, personalised recommendation, and more broadly targeted services. STREAMLINE will develop cross-sectorial analytics drawing on multi-source data originating from online media consumption, online games, telecommunications services, and multilingual web content.   STREAMLINE partners face big and fast data challenges. They serve over 100 million users, offer services that produce billions of events, yielding over 10 TB of data daily, and possess over a PB of data at rest. Their business use-cases are representative of EOMB, which cannot be handled efficiently & effectively by state-of-the-art technologies, as a consequence of system and human latencies.  System latency issues arise due to the lack of appropriate (data) stream-oriented analytics tools and more importantly the added complexity, cost, and burden associated with jointly supporting analytics for both “data at rest” and “data in motion.” Human latency results from the heterogeneity of existing tools and the low level programming languages required for development using an inordinate number of boilerplate codes that are system specific (e.g., Hadoop, SolR, Esper, Storm, and databases) and a plethora of scripts required to glue systems together.  Our research and innovation actions, include addressing the challenges brought on by system and human latencies. In this regard, STREAMLINE will: 1. Develop a high level declarative language and user-interface, and corresponding automatic optimisation, parallelisation, and system adaptation technologies that reduce the programming expertise required by data scientists, thereby enabling them to more freely focus on domain specific matters. 2. Overcome the complexity of the so-called ‘lambda architecture’ by delivering simplified operations that jointly support “data at rest” and “data in motion” in a single system and is compatible with the Hadoop ecosystem. 3. Develop fast reactive machine learning technologies based on distributed parameter servers and fully distributed asynchronous and approximate algorithms for fast results at high input rates.  The impact of developing a European open source tool for analysing “data at rest” and “data in motion” in a single system featuring a high level declarative language and a fast reactive machine learning library is much wider than just the recommender, ad targeting, and customer retention applications that the industrial partners in STREAMLINE will use to demonstrate the business value of our work for the data economy. Our open source tools will help Europe, in general, since they lower the big data analytics skills barrier, broaden the reach of data analytics tools, and are applicable to diverse market sectors, including healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. Thereby, enabling a broad number of European SMEs in other markets to explore and integrate these technologies into their businesses. At the same time, STREAMLINE will provide a solid foundation for big data leadership in Europe, by providing an open-source platform ready to be used by millions of stakeholders in companies, households, and government.  The STREAMLINE consortium comprises world-renowned scientists and innovators in the areas of database systems (DFKI), distributed systems (SICS), and machine learning (SZTAKI) who have won many international awards, hold 18 patents collectively, and have founded and advised nine startups. Complementing the research excellence are four leading European enterprises in the data economy, in the areas of global telecommunication services (e.g., Internet, IPTV, mobile, and landline networks) (PT), games and entertainment (Rovio), media content streaming (NMusic), and web-scale data extraction and business analytics (IMR), with P etab",0,0
396,54340,No,OpenHeritage: enabling the European Culture Economy,"The project will provide core building blocks to support the European digital cultural heritage and to enable the effective access of citizens, professionals and business operators. An analysis of the scenario of the 'cultural economy' leads to a socio-economic model that will leverage technology in balanced and sustainable ways, with the goal of making CH economically self-sustainable and of increasing European competitiveness.  By integrating the multimedia value chain, the project aims at the development and validation of: 1) dynamic models of territorial CH systems; 2) an innovative collections management solution to enhance smaller museums through modular access stations endowed with rich interactive media; 3) territorial infrastructures (Service Centres) for the management and valorisation of local networks of memory institutions; 4) a global portal mixing community areas with b2b services for the trading of rich media  Objectives: The main objectives of the project are: - Development of dynamic, computable models of territorial cultural systems to assess and valorise the qualities and strengths of each regional or local cultural system. - Development through integration of an innovative solution for collections management and user access in memory institutions based on existing systems developed by two of the partners. - Deployment of Territorial Service Centres supporting memory institutions through facilities management, customer relationship management, storage, promotion and transaction services (a new model of cultural Application Service Provider (ASP)). - Validation of the model and related technologies and services in significant test beds, through a range of technological and territorial validation activities. - Launch of a global 'openheritage.com' enterprise for the exploitation of the European CH through an advanced portal encompassing both traditional 'community' features and b2b areas for the trading of rich media asset  Work description: The project plans to design, to verify, to implement through adequate enabling technologies and to validate a comprehensive model for the valorisation of the European Cultural Heritage by leveraging sustainable innovation and by exploiting the opportunities offered by the so-called 'new economy' with its rapid shift towards the accessibility of user-driven cultural services and 'experimential' entertainment values. The application of technological solutions to memory institutions has failed to express substantive and sustainable results, mostly because of the lack of a self-supporting economic model for the promotion and exploitation of CH through ICT and because of an improper use of innovation, very often deployed in an auto-referential and 'technology push' way. The ongoing shift towards a new 'cultural economy' based on intangible services and on accessible, on-demand 'experiences' places memory institutions in the uncomfortable position of having to compete (in terms of entertainment and experience value) in a new, unusual horizon subject to market forces. This is a particularly severe problem for the multitude of 'minor' memory institutions that represent up to 95% of the existing heritage in most European countries.  The project addresses the above scenario by providing: - dynamic models of territorial CH systems aimed at valorising the qualities and strengths of each regional or local cultural system; - an innovative solution for collections management and user access in memory institutions based on existing systems developed by two of the partners; - Territorial Service Centres supporting memory institutions through facilities management, customer relationship management, storage, promotion and transaction services (a new model of cultural Application service Provider (ASP)); - a global 'openheritage.com' enterprise for the exploitation of the European CH through an advanced portal specialised in the b2b trading of rich media assets.  Milestones: The main milestones and expected results are: M1.1 - Progress Report 1; M1.2 - Progress Report 2; M1.3 - Progress Report 3; M1.4 - Progress report 4 and Final Report; M1.5 - Consortium and exploitation agreement; M2.1 - Requirements analysis; M3.1 - Modelling software prototype; M3.2 - Collections Management software prototype; M3.3 - Territorial Service Centre prototypes; M3.4 - Portal prototype; M4.1 - Business plan; M4.2 - Start of the openheritage.com company; M4.3 - Major dissemination event; M5.1 - demonstration Report; M5.2 - Evaluation Report.",0,0

Few novel treatments have emerged in recent years, because their aetiology is poorly understood. The recent development of new, high resolution, high-throughput research technologies, including large-scale genetic studies using microarrays and genome sequencing, high-resolution neuroimaging, neurobiology and medical/bioinformatics provide an opportunity to advance the field rapidly through the translation of knowledge on fundamental aetiology into benefit for the patient. TRiP is a joint initiative by five of the world’s leading psychiatric research centres, two in Europe and one in the USA with two emerging powerhouses of neuroscience research in China, formed to accelerate basic and clinical research into mental illness. These key research players will exchange state of the art research methodology and provide training in psychiatry research. The international dimension in TRiP directly addresses the IRSES action, which encourages long-term research collaboration between MS/AC and eligible third country partners. The participants are ideal partners, because of their world-class research expertise, complementarities, and track record of cooperation, which will result in enduring scientific exchange and collaboration between key players in the field in the EU, China and the USA. TRIP will harmonize state of the art research across the centres in order to tackle the most difficult research problems in biological psychiatry, allowing the harmonisation of phenotype measurements in patient populations, the development and dissemination of complex and advanced techniques and methodologies, the pooling of resources for direct comparison and combination of large datasets, the cross-disciplinary training of future leaders in this field and the translation of these findings for patient benefit, such as drug development and clinical genetics.",0,0
154,214112,No,Reclaiming the Cities in the post-Yugoslav space,"Over the last decade citizens of the Western Balkans region, an area interested by the enlargement of the European Union (EU), have increasingly been advocating for inclusion in decision-making affecting the restructuring of their urban habitat. This emerging activism addresses the so-called “Right to the City” (RTC), defined as the collective right to intervene to reshape the urbanisation process. A variety of citizen initiatives emerged, brought about by grassroots groups reclaiming, through different tactics, the citizens’ right to participate in decisions related to urban planning and the use of public space. These bottom-up demands have been echoed by both the United Nations’ New Urban Agenda (2016) and the European Union’s Pact of Amsterdam (2016), which called for a global commitment to sustainable urban development to be accomplished in cooperation with local communities and civil society actors.  By bridging Critical Citizenship Studies with Social Movement Studies and Europeanization theories, this comparative research explores the dynamics of urban activism in the post-Yugoslav space. It examines the diverse ways in which RTC groups have responded to projects of urban restructuring of their cities and to the on-going privatisation of the public space resulting from the transition of former Yugoslav republics from socialist to market economies. By employing qualitative methods for collecting and analysing empirical data, specifically in-depth semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observation as well as analysis of primary and secondary sources, this project aims at providing new theoretical insights useful in understanding how citizens in post-socialist countries enact their citizenship today. Moreover, the research illuminates the extent to which urban grassroots initiatives are shaped both by their embeddedness in European social movement networks and by the opportunities and constraints offered by the EU enlargement process.",1,0
225,64796,No,Computer design of a bio-mimetic single-molecule molecular motor,"Recently much attention has been paid to the construction of different prototypes of molecular motors powered by chemical, electrochemical and photochemical reactions. However, the task of designing bio-mimetic molecular devices capable to achieve an efficient photo driven rotary motion is still far from complete. The objective of the present research project is to demonstrate, through a series of theoretical-computational studies that is possible to approach a rational design of a bio-mimetic device. In particular the ultimate target of the research is the first-principle design of a bio-mimetic single-molecule molecular motor based on the 4-cyclopent-2 ' -enylidene-3 , 4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole framework or its higher homologous. To our knowledge, compounds based on this framework have never been investigated/synthesized and can thus potentially lead to a new class of molecular devices. The design strategy proposed in the present project is based on the successful development of computer tools that allow for an accurate and systematic description of the photochemical reaction paths in organic molecules. The major target is to define the size of the substituents and the pattern of substitution that allow for peak unidirectional efficiency for both the Z->E and E->Z rotary motion. We will employ abinitio MCSCF and multireference-MP2 (MR-MP2) methods to construct torsional analytic force field controlling the photoisomerization of the target chromophores, superior homologues and the corresponding chiral derivatives along their photoisomerization paths. Additionally, we will use the MCSCF and MR-MP2 computations to predict the most likely photoinduced decomposition pathways for aforementioned compound, as well as to evaluate the time scale of the photoisomerization event and the prevalency of unidirectional rotary motion on the excited state. We believe that the above project will provide a formative experience in the field of advanced computational chemistry. During the research work the applicant will learn how to use different advanced computational chemistry packages for the search and characterization of organic reaction mechanisms and conformational analysis. In particular, the applicant will have the opportunity, through the proposed research, to become an expert in the field of computational investigation of photochemical reactivity. More importantly the applicant will have the chance to acquire skill in the use of high level abinitio data for the construction non-standard torsional analytic force fields to be used in the design of novel bio-mimetic materials and/or for tackling mechanistic problems in photochemistry. The group of Prof. Massimo Olivucci has long been involved in the investigation of the photophysical and photochemical properties of biological chromophores. Thus, the new computational strategies, the development of which is part of the proposed project, and the integration of different computational tools, shall be of fundamental importance in further studies of chromophores photostability.",0,0

A surprising fact is that twothirds of the older adults who said that they felt lonely were either married or living with a partner of some kind. But loneliness is not only an issue for older generations. Nowadays there is growing concern about the loss of values and the increase of loneliness in youngsters, there is a lack of intergenerational communication: many young people is not enjoying the opportunity to learn from experience and values through the direct contact with elderly people. The society has evolved in this sense while formal and non-formal education is not covering this issue. In this context, the objective of Adopt Grandparents is to implement a social business model to connect elderly people living in care homes and youngsters. They will carry out shared activities where: - Elders will enjoy direct contact with young people sharing experiences and interests. - Youngsters complement their education through the contact with the experience of elderly people within a complete programme of activities. Adopt Grandparents provides a Social & Education Training Programme for youngsters with a formal roadmap for young trainees and a visits schedule for the elderly under the supervision of instructors. After three years operating as a non-profit organisation, Intergenerational Technologies SL was constituted as a company to launch Adopt Grandparents initiative as a social economy business. For the time being Adopt Grandparents has been launched in Spain and Portugal and the plans of the company is to scale to global level.

842,109638,No,Evolutionary strategy for plant breeding,"'Large proportions of eukaryotic genomes consist of transposable elements (TEs), predominantly of retrotransposons. They are generally considered as intra-chromosomal parasites. However, their periodical activity bursts influenced organization of host genomes and contributed to beneficial traits. Remarkably, number of transposon generated phenotypic innovations was subsequently selected by humans during plant domestication and breeding. Therefore, retrotransposons could be also considered as attractive endogenous source of genetic variation. Unfortunately so far there is no experimental/technological means to exploit this potential in a controlled fashion.  Recently my laboratory revealed surprisingly selective epigenetic, environmental and developmental mechanisms controlling retrotransposition in Arabidopsis. Here, I intend to build on this knowledge and establish well controlled retrotransposition system a crop plant to liberate its innate genetic diversity buried in silenced TEs.  To achieve this, I propose a stepwise strategy with the following three objectives:  1. Deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and environmental cues controlling retrotransposition in Arabidopsis thaliana and use this model plant to develop universal methodology for detection of retrotransposition. 2. Transfer the knowledge and methodologies to non model plant. I propose to use Arabidopsis lyrata as close relative of A. thaliana, however with 50% enlarged genome due to expansion of retrotransposon populations. 3. Using methodologies and experimental conditions developed for A. thaliana and A. lyrata we will apply them to maize where we can also take advantage of genetic resources (mutants in epigenetic regulation) in conjunction with responses to selected abiotic stresses.  If the progress towards above listed objectives was swift, I will initiate collaboration with a corn breeding company to create EVOBREED generated population for evaluation of its phenotypic diversity.'",0,0
425,111331,No,VALorising European Research for Innovation in agriculturE and forestry,"Many EU and nationally funded research projects in the fields of agriculture and forestry provide excellent results, but the outreach and translation of these results into field practices is limited. The overall aim of VALERIE is to boost the outreach of research by facilitating the integration into innovative field practices. The work in VALERIE consists of three major approaches. (1). Stakeholder-driven approach. Ten case studies set the central stage for the bottom-up approach of the project, aided by highly effective tools of web semantics and ontology. Cases are centred around a specific supply-chain, a farming sector or a landscape. The stakeholder communities (SHC) represent the natural networks engaged in innovation. They drive the process of articulating innovation needs, enabling the retrieval of precisely matching knowledge and solutions, and evaluating their potential in the local context. (2) Theme-driven approach. VALERIE retains six thematic domains that are at the heart of sustainable production and resource use. These six provide the back-bone for structuring the annotation and summarising activities, which in turn will provide a vast body of knowledge accessible via the Communication Facility (CF). (3) Knowledge disclosure. VALERIE will launch a ‘Communication Facility’ (CF) for the EIP-Networking Facility. The CF supports communication amongst actors in the field and researchers. Next, it injects new knowledge into the innovation process, by enabling users to retrieve highly relevant (tailored-to-needs) information, based on their own vocabularies. In offering tools for communication, as well as content structured for efficient knowledge retrieval, the CF fuses the advantages typical of ‘learning networks’ and ‘linear’ modes of knowledge sharing. The CF will be set up, tested and integrated into the EIP-NF platform, as a generic infrastructure for use by ‘fresh’ stakeholder communities, also beyond the life of the VALERIE project.",0,0

908,9070,No,Computational Mechanisms of Interaction in Cooperative Work,"The increased prominence of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) as a research area and the recent emergence of groupware products within the USA and Japan has highlighted the growing market for this form of IT product. It is imperative that Europe captures a significant share of this future market. To do so, future CSCW developers will need to construct effective and well-founded cooperative systems. This basic research project examines the fundamental research questions which need to be solved to improve future CSCW systems development. A central aim of the project is the development of effective support cooperative work based on an understanding of the social character of work. Theories and techniques necessary to support the development of future computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems are being developed. These will be informed by a range of disciplines which combine an understanding of the nature of groups with the technology to support cooperative work within a real world setting. The project involves researchers from computer science and social science backgrounds working together on the techniques and theories to support cooperative systems development.   With respect to organizational setting, a number of different perspectives of organizations of direct relevance to the development of CSCW systems have been highlighted and contrasted. An initial framework to allow multiple perspectives of organizations has been developed.  Consideration of the effectiveness of different requirements methods for CSCW systems has been undertaken with the outlining of initial support for constructing CSCW systems requirements. Also, a wide range of available CSCW systems and products have been assessed in terms of their use of notation. This assessment will inform a set of recommendations for the use of notations in future CSCW systems.  Interaction has been considered in terms of its spatial characteristics and a spatial model of cooperation has been developed. In addition, interaction has been studied in terms of the use of shared objects and of a service to support this sharing is being developed. APPROACH AND METHODS   To lay the foundation for the future development of CSCW systems, COMIC's approach is to examine the practical and theoretical problems which need to be overcome to allow effective CSCW product development. This research will be undertaken in a multi-disciplinary manner by a strong team of key CSCW researchers.   COMIC will concentrate on the development of CSCW systems designed to work within a real-world context. The project combines an understanding of work practice with an investigation of future technical infrastructures for CSCW. To maximise the effect of the research being undertaken, the project focuses on four key research topics in CSCW systems development:   - the organisational setting of CSCW systems  - the derivation of requirements for the design and development of CSCW systems  - the assessment and augmentation of notations to describe and represent cooperative activities  - the development of novel interaction mechanisms for CSCW.   This work necessitates the effort of a strong multi-disciplinary team of CSCW researchers. Each of themes are been examined from a different disciplinary perspective in order to inform cooperative systems development.   POTENTIAL   This basic research project will result in recommendations, new techniques, architectures and demonstrators of direct applicability for future CSCW developments. Results of the project will provide an understanding of the relationship between cooperative work and supporting technology. They will also inform future methods for the development of CSCW systems and the different technologies required to support them.",0,0

990,228022,No,ImmunoPET directed to specific subtypes of GABAA receptors as strategy for molecular mapping of behaviour and mental illness,"Changes in GABA receptors are known hallmarks for numerous neurological diseases including schizophrenia which is a severe psychiatric disorder that has a profound effect on both the individuals affected and society. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is complex because of the loss of high specific biomarkers. Research papers have suggested that the differential expression of GABAA receptors in the brain is associated with this mental disease. The current evidence on GABAergic abnormalities in schizophrenia is mostly based on postmortem studies and, in this sense, in vivo measurements of GABAA receptor subunits can reveal additional insights.  This project will develop Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes which could unveil quantitative information about GABAA receptor expression in schizophrenia patients. However, the lack of imaging tracers with high affinity and specificity do not shed a clear light on the diagnosis in a traditional PET setting. In this sense, the immune-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) is a non-invasive technology based in antibody imaging which reveals a specific and sensitive molecular characterization of the cell surface phenotype in vivo. Nevertheless, its success in neuroimage is limited because of intact antibodies cannot penetrate the Brain Blood Barrier (BBB) in healthy conditions. However, GABARPET will tap into a small recombinant bispecific antibody construct targeting the GABAA receptors as well as the transferrin receptor because it is able to readily transmigrate across the BBB in vivo after peripheral injection. This project wants to develop di-single-chain variable fragment (di-scFv) directed to α1 and α2 subunits of GABAA receptors. Then, they will be labeled with conventional radionuclides produced by cyclotron as 18F and 89Zr. ImmunoPET probes will be used in wild-type mice, GABAA receptor knockout mice and different kind of rodent models of schizophrenia.",0,0
952,228017,No,Digital Lemmatized Edition of Prose 2 (Franco-Italian prosification of Benoît de Sainte-Maure's Roman de Troie),"The project aims to produce a lemmatized diplomatic digital edition of a hitherto unpublished text of the Franco-Italian Middle Ages, the second mise en prose of Benoît de Sainte-Maure’s Roman de Troie or Prose 2 (ante 1289). The interest of Prose 2 lies, among other things, in being an original French text written in Italy (Veneto). It is therefore a particularly significant witness of the Franco-Italian textual and linguistic galaxy, which has seen a renewed interest over the past decade, especially with regard to the contribution made by Italian scribes in the spread of medieval French literature. Finally, from the point of view of cultural history, Prose 2 is a key component of the Italian reception of the Trojan narrative, a complex panorama that is still being defined in detail. From this perspective, the Paduan-Venetian region between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries shows a singular receptivity: several cities, primarily Venice and Padua, endorse a mythology of origins entirely based on the world of Trojan heroes. As Trojan history becomes integrated into urban historiography, this “familiarity with the ancient” contributes to the later emergence of a cultural attitude known as “Veneto pre-humanism”. The typology of the proposed edition is a digital diplomatic edition allowing the manipulation of the text for the purposes of linguistic analysis, in particular lemmatization, and the creation of a dictionary of Prose 2, to be also included in the DiFrI-Dictionary of the Franco-Italian, a project based at Padua University. With respect to her background as a researcher, this fellowship will have a crucial impact on the career of the applicant, offering concrete possibilities to attain an academic position. The activities planned during this two-year fellowship (organization of two workshop and one international conference) will allow to significantly bolster her CV, whose key strength is currently represented by individual research activity.",0,0
961,83669,No,Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows: illuminating the early Universe,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) are brief and extremely bright flashes, caused by the death of a very massive star. The collision of the explosion with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) causes an afterglow at all wavelengths (radio to X-rays).  In the optical, spectroscopy of the afterglow allows to infer various properties of the ISM of the galaxy hosting the GRB: the metallicity, the neutral hydrogen gas column density, the dust and molecular hydrogen content, the level of ambient radiation and/or particle density and the kinematics of host-galaxy gas clouds and possible outflows (on both stellar and galactic scale).   I am currently leading a project that is collecting spectroscopy of a sample of GRB afterglows, which will allow - for the first time - study o f the interplay between the internal gas-physical properties mentioned above and the external properties (e.g. luminosity, colour, morphology) for a sample of high-redshift GRB host galaxies.   This proposal aims not only to continue this on-going work, but also to extend the investigation to higher redshifts, to the epoch of re-ionisation. After the Big Bang the Universe cooled down to become completely neutral, a period known as the Dark Ages. This dark period ended when the first stars and galaxies started to form and re-ionise the Universe, during the epoch of re-ionisation. Very little is known how this re-ionisation actually took place, and GRBs are one of the main probes of this important epoch in the history of the Universe.  This MC fellowship proposal will shed light on the epoch of re-ionisation through observations of high-redshift GRB afterglows. The investigation is to be performed at the University of Copenhagen, the proposed host institute, in the very active GRB group of Jens Hjorth. Prof. Hjorth¿s group is at the forefront of GRB science, and will have guaranteed access to the upcoming X-shooter instrument, which is perfectly suited for observations of very-high-redshift GRBs.",0,0
921,73082,No,Macroeconomics with Incomplete Insurance Markets,"This project aims at exploring the implications of incomplete insurance markets in a macroeconomic set up. The particular form of market incompleteness focused on in this project is the absence of insurance markets in which individual-specific risks may be insured against. The reason for focusing on incomplete insurance markets is that, when compared with the standard approach, models wifely incomplete market structure has different qualitative and quantitative properties that lead to strikingly different normative implications for a variety of issues of interest to macroeconomists and policy makers. The framework is that of multi-agent dynamic general equilibrium models in which agents are exposed to uninsured idiosyncratic risks. In this context we are particularly interested in (i) investigating the qualitative properties of equilibrium and improving the existing computational methods for analysing dynamic general equilibrium models with incomplete markets, (ii) understanding the mechanisms under which market incompleteness affects the business cycle and long ran growth. Emphasis will be given on the development of a general theoretical approach to the problem of existence and characterization of equilibrium. The adopted methodological approach is based on an emerging class of methods, called monotone map methods, which incorporates recent developments in mathematics studying fixed points for operators defined on partially order spaces (lattices). In the computational analysis emphasis will be given on the construction of efficient and flexible numerical algorithms able to capture the rich complexity of dynamic stochastic growth models with rational expectations and heterogeneous agents. Our methodological approach is based on providing numerical algorithms suitable for the numerical analysis of economies with aggregate uncertainty and persistent idiosyncratic shocks.",0,0
262,212298,No,Scaling Methods for Discrete and Continuous Optimization,"One of the most important open questions in optimization is to find a strongly polynomial algorithm for linear programming. The proposed project aims to tackle this problem by combining novel techniques from two different domains: discrete optimization and continuous optimization. We expect to contribute to exciting recent developments on the interface of these two fields.  We use and develop new variants of the classical scaling technique. From the discrete optimization side, recent work of the PI on generalized flows extends classical network flow theory and opens up new domains for strongly polynomial computability beyond integer constraint matrices. We will apply this novel scaling technique to obtain strongly polynomial algorithms for broad classes of linear programs. From the continuous optimization side, we aim to build the theory of geometric rescaling algorithms for linear and convex optimization. This approach combines first-order methods with geometric rescaling techniques to obtain a new family of polynomial-time algorithms. We expect to devise variants efficient in theory and in practice, which we will use in a wide range of applications. Our discrete and continuous techniques will have important applications in submodular function minimization. We will develop new, efficient algorithms for the general problem as well as for specific applications in areas such as machine learning and computer vision. In summary, the project will develop novel approaches for some of the most fundamental optimization problems. It will change the landscape of strongly polynomial computability, and make substantial progress towards finding a strongly polynomial algorithm for linear programming.",0,0
63,209239,Yes,Analysing the migration choices of HIV-positive gay men in England and France,"Despite improvements in available therapies and investments in prevention campaigns, HIV-rates continue to rise across European cities. Gay men are over-represented amongst people with HIV, thus experiencing the combined effects of homophobia and HIV-related stigma. Several studies have found a correlation between becoming HIV-positive and gay men’s decision to migrate, although most of them rely on quantitative methodologies and concern the US and Canada. In a European context we have very limited knowledge about the reasons why HIV-positive gay men choose to migrate to, and remain in, specific urban areas across the continent. This research project aims at addressing this gap in knowledge by investigating different migration patterns of HIV-positive gay men towards Birmingham and Brighton (England) and Marseille and Paris (France) at different historical times (the mid ‘80s/early ‘90s with the diffusion of the epidemic and a stigmatizing public discourse; the mid ‘90s/early 2000s with a new focus on prevention from health institutions and the introduction of effective therapies; the last decade with the introduction of a single drug-therapy and the recent introduction of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, PrEP). To better understand the complexity of factors pushing people to relocate and the perception of stigma in previous places of residence, data will be collected through questionnaires; in-depth interviews with both HIV-positive gay men of each generation and relevant stakeholders/policy-makers; and archival work to collect HIV-prevention campaigns, public health information and media news and reports among others. By shedding light on the dynamics of stigmatization still affecting HIV-positive gay men, the research project will provides an evidence base for policy makers and service providers in order to make their intervention for the well-being of HIV-positive gay men more effective.",1,1
266,31796,No,An integrated approach to assess and monitor desertification processes in the mediterranean basin.,"The objective is to use an integration of ecological models and information from operationnal earth observation and meteorological satellites to assess and monitor regional scale indicators of sensitivity to desertification.   Based on the work on three study sites: Languedoc (France), Valencia Province (Spain), and  Crete Island (Greece) conceptual and methodological pathways for deriving coherent  indicators of vegetation abundance and the erosional state of soils from remotely sensed  imagery (reflective and thermal domains) will be optimised, including methodological  refinements which permit to use this approach within a larger variety of climatic conditions  throughout the Mediterranean (i.e., regionalised data interpretation concepts, GIS-based  integration of ancillary information layers such as bedrock lithology, and digital elevation  data, the completion of spectral library information on vegetation and exposed soil and rock  surfaces, and the combined analysis of satellite measurements in the reflective and thermal  domain).  The project further attempts to define the conceptual requirements needed for designing an  operational 'Satellite-based Desertification Observatory' for the Mediterranean basin,  including the validation of the methods and processing modules needed for its implementation  in the context of three retrospective case studies.  Ecosystem dynamics and biochemistry models have become a popular means to examine the  ecological consequences of historic and future climatic changes. By simulating the seasonal  and multi-annual course of ecosystem functional processes (mainly carbon and water cycling)  from local to regional level the project attempts to gain deeper understanding of biophysical  processes which may be responsible for soil/vegetation changes recorded from the  retrospective satellite monitoring during the 1975-1995 period, and to predict likely future  changes, especially in most sensible areas.  The development of an approach for future projections of desertification, particularly with  respect to the risk of soil erosion and further degradation of vegetation communities  (Desertification Susceptibility Index) is an essential part of the project activities. In particular  the incorporation of 'degradation trends' (based on retrospective analysis of RS-derived  vegetation and soil characteristics), terrain parameters (from digital elevation data), such as  slope and exposition in terms of water availability and erosion susceptibility (model outputs),  appear particularly attractive for predicting the future development of desertification and  erosion at regional scales  The project is completed by a case study on the sustainable management of rangelands in  mountain ecosystems which attempts to integrate findings from the modules mentioned above.",0,0

Specifically, the roles of two previously identified but poorly characterised genes, nirI and nosR are to be investigated. These genes and their products will be characterised by both genetic and biochemical methods, and their interactions with other regulatory components will be analysed using mutant strains, in combination with powerful techniques for metabolic analysis. The project will utilise a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry and biomathematics in order to address this important biological topic.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The programme will provide extensive training in modern molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology, which will both extend my current knowledge of these fields and introduce several new components, in the subjects of biomathematics and metabolic analysis for which the host institute is renowned.

934,195620,No,Biomechanical analysis of in vivo directional collective migration,"Directional cell migration is important in physiology and pathology. Molecular mechanisms regulating directional migration are largely studied; but the role of mechanical cues and their interplay with biochemical signals during directional migration is poorly understood. To address this we will use Neural Crest (NC) cells, a highly migratory embryonic cell population. Evidence about how chemical cues regulate NC migration has accumulated, but nothing is known about the biomechanics of NC migration. This proposal focuses on understanding how NC interacts with the mechanical cues from its environment during directional migration in vivo, as well as understanding the molecular nature of this interaction. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1) to study the role of mechanical cues in vivo and their interplay with chemical signals during in vivo NC migration. Aim 2) identify the molecular mechanism by which the mechanical properties of the substrate are sensed and translated as signals into the NC, and to test the role of Nedd9 as a key component of this process. (Nedd9 appears in a screening that I performed to identify potential NC mechanosensors).          These studies will provide new tools and information on the role of mechanical cues during directional migration in vivo, how these cues interact with chemical guidance, how are they integrated as cellular signalling within cells? These questions are poorly studied aspects of cell migration, thus our results will be a real contribution to the state-of-the-art in cell migration. This multidisciplinary proposal is will be mutually beneficial, providing the host and me with new collaborations. A research line will be created in ERA with NC as a model to study biophysics of migration in vivo. I will complement my current skills with new knowledge in biophysics of cell migration and managerial skills; this will have a countless impact in the career that I project as an independent researcher in the cell migration field.",0,0
602,103989,No,Unmanned Aerial Systems in European Airspace,"'To unlock the true potential of the UAS market, stakeholders need to break a series of entangled challenges. Today, in the absence of UAS regulations, the development of solutions is risky and expensive for industry, and essentially aimed at military applications. As a result, the UAS market is small and its impact on European industry is limited. Also, there is no improvement in UAS social acceptance, including a lack of political willingness to develop regulations. While this vicious circle is what is preventing the development of a civil UAS market alongside the existing military UAS market, it is also a great opportunity for Europe to take leadership and to secure an advantageous position in what is predicted by many UAS market studies to be a large and sustainable market with spin-offs into manned aviation, space and other high-tech markets. The overall objective of ULTRA is to develop a civil UAS Master Plan that will break this vicious circle in order to: 1. Unlock the true potential of the UAS market by addressing civil applications that are not systematically addressed today; and 2. Ensure that European industry plays a leading role at an international level in the development of UAS solutions. The civil UAS Master Plan will build upon all relevant prior work (including the recommendations of the EU UAS Panel), and will leverage existing regulations and infrastructures in order to enable deployment of specific civil UAS applications within the next 5 years. The Master Plan will also highlight regulations and infrastructures that need to be developed in order to completely unlock the civil UAS market within the next 10-15 years, and will articulate the impact of a civil UAS market on European industry and quality of life. To achieve this objective, ULTRA will employ the following high level approach: - ULTRA includes world-recognized experts covering all UAS stakeholders, i.e. manufacturers, regulators, ANSPs, customers and research labs. Manufacturers will enable solutions, regulators and ANSPs will ensure that solutions are safe, customers will validate that solutions satisfy their needs and finally research labs will ensure promotion of innovative concepts. ULTRA will also seek the active involvement of EASA, EUROCONTROL and the NAAs (i.e. the regulators) in the document review process and in workshops. - There is a strong emphasis on a coordinated, step-by-step and pragmatic approach to civil UAS insertion in order to deploy specific civil UAS applications in the short-term and minimize the cost, risk and stakeholder impact at each step. - There is a strong focus on performing a gap analysis in order to build upon all relevant prior work, and identify the minimum required regulations and infrastructures that need to be developed in order to enable a civil UAS market. The intention is to reuse as much as possible existing infrastructures and innovative concepts in order to minimize development and deployment times, costs and risks. - There is a strong emphasis on integrating SMEs into the UAS supply chain alongside Europe’s traditional aerospace industry that has a long history in the development of standards, certification and system integration. SMEs have the agility and speed required for short-term innovation that is a critical enabler for short-term civil UAS deployment. SMEs together with Europe’s traditional aerospace industry can provide solutions combining safety and affordability, as well as a healthy supply base ultimately resulting in European growth. - There will be a strong focus on small UAS solutions (i.e. UAS < 150kg) that promise to be cost effective and to satisfy the needs of the civil UAS market (i.e. promise to have the largest socioeconomic impact). While ULTRA will focus on small UAS (due to budget and time limitations), if ULTRA identifies applications with a positive socioeconomic impact that require civil UASs > 150kg, ULTRA will comment on those in the civil UAS Master Plan.

357,188228,No,The Reception of Irish Literature in Italy: 1900-1950,"'This research project aims to investigate crucial aspects of the reception of Irish literature in Italy during the first fifty years of the twentieth century, with special attention to the politics of translation and mediation in the fascist era. Having devised a theoretical framework that combines cultural and translation studies with evidence-based historical research, I will read archival evidence in the light of recent scholarship on cultural mediation/translation, and discuss the strategies adopted by translators, publishers and intellectuals in their attempt at introducing Irish literary products within Italian culture. This study will ascertain whether or not the Italian cultural system recognized Irish specificity within Anglo-American literature and, if so, in which ways such specificity was articulated. In order to investigate this topic, the research work will analyse both publications about Ireland and translations of Irish literary works, as well as the role of key mediating figures. This study will therefore explore how foreign literatures entered and affected the Italian cultural system, and will focus on Irish literature as a significant and yet understudied case. It will produce a 'cartography' of the reception of Irish literature in Italy, while assessing the degree of awareness in Italy of the distinctiveness of Irish literature. The composite portrait of the various images of Ireland in Italy will also provide significant information about both Italian culture and its mediators, and consequently enhance our understanding of intercultural dynamics in early twentieth-century Europe.'",0,0
136,39091,Yes,"Labour demand, education and the dynamics of social exclusion","This proposal outlines a programme of research which will study the dynamics of social integration and exclusion among a number of groups at risk (young people, females, migrants and unemployed) in Europe, against a background of structural changes in European labour markets arising from technical progress, market integration, and a variety of differences in educational and training programmes.   The proposed research agenda has three key objectives:   - to analyse the effects of technological change on the demand for labour in terms of education and skills,   - to develop new indicators of 'social exclusion' and new analytical techniques to explore the dynamics of exclusion for problems groups,  - to investigate how different labour market, educational, immigration and social policies have moderated this process, and to suggest alternative policy directions.   A major contribution will aim at methodological advances in the analysis of multidimensional indicators of social exclusion. While labour market and income outcomes are important, aspects such as types and location of housing (e.g. 'ghettos'), access to public services, crime, health and the nature of social networks are also essential. Social exclusion should also be viewed as a relative concept that changes over time and differs between cultures.  The research will also emphasise the sequential nature of social exclusion, which can be halted and even reversed. Technological change will be considered as a major cause. The dynamics of social exclusion and the role of training will be studied over time using panel data and for particular groups at risk.   The proposed research will be co-ordinated by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), and will involve the collaboration of ten research teams drawn from a variety of disciplines (demography, sociology, political science, economic history, labour economics, educational economics, gender economics, economics of technical change, international economics, institutional economics, econometrics and statistics).   The collaboration of teams from Ireland, the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Israel is essential to the achievement of the research objectives. These countries provide an ideal natural experiment: they display strong contrasts in the scale, character and timing of important processes of social inclusion and exclusion, such as female work, immigration, unemployment and differences in training and educational systems. There are also, however, similarities between subsets of these countries, such as particular migration experiences, unemployment processes and the general threat of technical change. The contrasts will provide a sharp test of the methodology which underlies the proposed research.   In addition, the contrasting national experiences will help to distinguish purely national and local aspects of social exclusion from those structural features common throughout the EU. The research will be based on the intensive use of large-scale panel datasets, and the development of new 'register-based' surveys.",1,1
397,40205,No,Comparative Genome Analysis in Dicotyledonous Crop Species and Arabidopsis,"The EuDicotMap programme is an integrated project designed to carry out the full range of research tasks associated with section 3.1.1.(Molecular genetic maps of the Biotechnology work programme). Its aims are to explore comparative mapping and exploit this across a broad spectrum of dicotyledonous plants both of economical and scientific importance. It is centered on the extensive use of Arabidopsis and rice to idendify highly conserved sequences within the ESTs and extends the exploitation of the ESSA project to a number of cultivated crops including Brassica, potato and aubergine, pea, Lotus and alfalfa, sunflower, lettuce and chicory, sugar beet and its wild relatives and Prunus.  The programme adresses four main issues:  a) Identification of conserved genes (at least 400) from EST databases, mapping them in Arabidopsis, and use as anchor loci in each major crop. This will provide a framework of common markers with identified functions as well as at least one dicotyledonous reference map.  b) Mapping long-range synteny within crop families using the Arabidopsis anchor loci, exchanging markers already mapped in one of the species as well as mapping additional less conserved genes of common interest.  c) Evaluating long-range synteny between Arabidopsis and the other crops and between the different families using the anchor markers and trying to define blocks of synteny which may allow reconstitution of the evolution of the various genomes.  d) Evaluating synteny at the microscale level with well characterized regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Demonstration of such synteny will open the way for a genome shuttling cloning strategy for genes of agronomical importance.  The expected deliverables are the following:  a) a publicly available database of the set of universal anchor probes, b) a series of highly saturated and comparable genetic maps for major European dicot crops,  c) a list of synteny blocks which should facilitate genome manipulation both by breeders and molecular geneticists,  d) infommation on specific loci, including genes for flowering, seed fommation and maturation and disease resistance, in a variety of crops.  In addition this work should shed new light on the evolution of the dicotyledon plant genomes, with respect to spreading of members of multigene families as we as ancient cryptic and recent polyploidy.  The research will involve fifteen leading European groups in their field, from 9 different countries, including one from Eastem Europe, two private industrial partners and two who have close association with a private company. This close association with private partners guarantees that a number of findings will be directly exploited by industry. In addition this effort should both increase seed company competitivity through the PIP and numerous unfommal contacts, and stimulate academic research, from which the competitivity of the enterprises in tum depends for the near future.",0,0

During a week they will be brought together around a topic of interest. In the morning, specialists in the field will give series of lectures. In the afternoon the students will present their research work. The possibility of presenting their work, in a friendly and informal atmosphere, to some of the top professors in their area, it is supposed to give them the possibility of improving their own research. Moreover, the Summer School will take the form of a residential seminar enabling intensive scholarly and social contacts among young European economists. The topics selected deal with theoretical and policy issues of a general nature showing, nevertheless, a marked European relevance. These topics are at the same time at the cutting edge of research. The 2002 Summer School's topic is 'Endogenous Fluctuations'. The goal of the Summer School is to provide Ph.D. students with an advanced overview of the more recent developments in the endogenous business cycle literature. This research has shown that business cycles may emerge, even in the absence of exogenous shocks, due to imperfect competition and increasing returns in production. As departures from perfect competition (specially in the labour market) are relevant for European economies, the endogenous fluctuations approach might prove very fruitful for the understanding of European business cycles. The 2003 Summer School's topic is 'Microeconometrics'. The motivation for this course arises as a result of the increasing use of large individual level data sources in the analysis of economic behaviour and evaluation of economic policy. This not only reflects the growing availability of such data in Europe but also the increasing ability to utilise micro-level data sources effectively on microcomputers. The use of micro data in estimation and policy evaluation is now becoming widespread in Europe. At the same time there is an expanding development of econometric methods for such data. The aim of this summer school is to provide a detailed frontier level training of these developments. It will be empirically oriented using practical computer examples throughout based on available European micro data sets. This is an important area in which Europe has rather lagged behind North America and this Summer School is designed to redress that balance.",0,0
526,106336,No,Foundational Research on MULTIlevel comPLEX networks and systems,"Future advancements in ICT domain are closely linked to the understanding about how multi-level complex systems function. Indeed, multi-level dependencies may amplify cascade failures or make more sudden the collapse of the entire system. Recent large-scale blackouts resulting from cascades in the power-grid coupled to the control communication system witness this point very clearly. A better understanding of multi-level systems is essential for future ICT's and for improving life quality and security in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. In this respect, complex networks science is particularly suitable for the many challenges that we face today, from critical infrastructures and communication systems, to techno-social and socio-economic networks.MULTIPLEX proposes a substantial paradigm shift for the development of a mathematical, computational and algorithmic framework for multi-level complex networks. Firstly, this will lead to a significant progress in the understanding and the prediction of complex multi-level systems.

373,16813,No,Elucidation of aggregation mechanisms of proteins in fresh an frozen fish.,"The aim is to:  obtain a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of aggregation of proteins in frozen fish in order to allow better prediction of fish quality in terms of texture, nutrition and food safety;  examine the interaction and aggregation of myofibrillar proteins from selected fish species by direct and less empirical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), radiolabelling, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy;  and relate the changes in the structure and denaturation of proteins over a period of time in frozen storage to changes in physical and chemical, rheological and sensory properties. The project examined the nature of aggregation including myofibrillar protein protein, protein formaldehyde and protein lipid interactions in gadoid fish namely cod (Gadus morhua) and hake (Merluccius merluccius) in frozen storage at -20 C and -30 C.  Systematic studies on cod muscle using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that with whole muscle stored at -20 C the formation of aggregates appeared earlier than at -30 C and was accompanied by crosslinking, formation of microaggregates and ring shaped structures. The aggregation is suggested to be due to sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) soluble noncovalent covalent bonds initially and after 7 months due to covalent linkages possibly other than disulphide bonds. The Dmax value obtained from TEM morphometric studies of the deformation of the hexagonal arrangement of the myofilaments can be used to monitor changes with storage at -20 C and -30 C. Immunocytochemistry studies using electron microscopy were accomplished with polyclonal antibodies to myosin and actin.  Formaldehyde interacted with a number of amino acids. The binding of myosin antibodies to myosin was reduced in the presence of formaldehyde. Hake actomyosin was affected irreversibly and to a greater degree on frozen storage and in the presence of formaldehyde than chicken actomyosin. The aggregates recovered from cod stored at higher temperatures of -10 C produced fluorescent compounds which may be associated with lipid oxidation products and which require further characterisation.  Analysis of proteins by gel filtration indicated an increase in the low molecular weight proteins, initially 55 000 - 160 000 daltons followed by an increase in small molecules of less than 5000 daltons. Although the changes occurred faster in samples stored at -20 C compared with -30 C, the samples at both storage temperatures were comparable after 8 months. Clearly prolonged frozen storage leads to proteolysis. An increase in the alkali soluble protein was noted only after 5 months storage at -20 C, and increasing amounts of low molecular weight substances and myosin heavy chains were identified after 8 months. Amino acid analysis confirmed the presence of mainly myosin in the aggregates.  Organoleptic changes in the stored fish at -20 C and -30 C were apparent after 158 days. Commercially important lean galoid fish are susceptible to protein denaturation and aggregation in frozen storage resulting in toughening of muscle and unpalatability. There is no satisfactory explanation for the development of aggregation as yet.   It is proposed to examine in detail the nature of aggregation including myofibrillar protein, protein-formaldehyde and protein-lipid interactions in gadoid fish, namely cod (Gadus morhua) and hake (Merluccius merluccius). The studies will be undertaken on freshly caught fish and over a period of time in frozen storage at -20 C and -30 C. Systematic studies in both model systems and intact tissue will be undertaken using a powerful range of nonempirical techniques, namely tritium or carbon-13 NMR; radiolabelled TMAO to monitor the formation of formaldehyde; and immunocytochemistry combined with modern electrophoretic, chromatographic and rheological techniques to clearly define the nature of aggregation and its effect on amino acids and organoleptic properties.   The research is in 4 phases: the nature of myofibrellar interactions in muscle; the distribution and quantification of formaldehyde formation in fresh and frozen fish; the changes in individual fish proteins on frozen storage; and the characterization of frozen fish proteins.",0,0

669,82909,No,Effect of Androgen hormones on hippocampal CA1 area synaptic remodelling,"Estrogens have a well-characterized central beneficial effect in women on cognition, memory and mood, which is compromised in the postmenopausal period due to the failure of ovarian estrogen synthesis. Androgen production from gonadal and adrenal sources in both sexes also declines substantially with age. Since androgens have been demonstrated to facilitate cognitive functions and attenuate the risks for developing neurodegenerative disorders, maintenance of androgen levels may be at least as important as t hat of estrogens. Despite these beneficial effects, central action of androgens has, to date, received only limited attention. Research in the third country host laboratory has demonstrated that androgens can potently influence hippocampal synaptic remodelling, an action that was observed in both sexes.  This synaptoplasticity mechanism is postulated to be the morphological basis of the cognition-enhancing effect of both estrogens and androgens in the hippocampus. In the outgoing period of the fellowship, the fellow will be involved in studies that aim to clarify the mechanisms and behavioural consequences of androgen-induced hippocampal synaptic remodelling, using an innovative interdisciplinary behavioural and morphological approach. The expected results may have important health and therapy-related implications in the fields of neuropsychiatry and endocrinology, particularly hormone replacement therapy. During these studies, the fellow will receive extensive training in the fields of steroid endocrinology, neuroanatomy, stereotaxic surgery, electron microscopic stereology, and behavioural neuroscience.

The design trade-offs of interactive wireless video systems will be studied, and performance comparisons provided both in the context of existing and future generations of wireless systems. Innovative schemes enabling joint optimisation over wireless links will be developed, that include the development of flexible channel coding and modulation schemes, the adaptation of existing source coding schemes with respect to their ability for JSCC/D and the specific development of new optimised ones. In parallel, efficient and adaptive optimisation strategies will be defined, that jointly control the coding blocks and realistically take into account the system limitations and specifications, such as the presence of ciphering to ensure transmission security, the presence of one or several wireless hops...  This includes also the design of a cross-layer protocol allowing the necessary information exchanges between the upper and lower layers of the protocol stack. Highly needed to improve the overall system performance in a joint approach, this cross-layer design aims at being compatible with existing protocols in the wireless transmission domains.

The idea of such a globally interconnected continuum emerged with the RFID technology, and this concept has considerably been extended to the current vision that envisages a plethora of heterogeneous objects interacting with the physical environment.Today, a large number of different means are used to enable communication between heterogeneous devices. We see these as &quot;Intranet of things&quot;, representing vertical silos that do not support interoperability. However, this balkanisation of efforts will lead to a predictable slowdown in devising a viable global solution. Furthermore, existing solutions do not address the scalability requirements for a future Internet of Things, they provide inappropriate models of governance and fundamentally neglect privacy and security in their design.IoT-A, the Internet-of-Things Architecture, proposes the creation of an architectural reference model together with the definition of an initial set of key building blocks. Together they are envisioned as crucial foundations for fostering a future Internet of Things. Using an experimental paradigm, IoT-A will combine top-down reasoning about architectural principles and design guidelines with simulation and prototyping to explore the technical consequences of architectural design choices.IoT-A will lead to the following tangible outcomes: 1) architectural reference model for the interoperability of Internet-of-Things systems, outlining principles and guidelines for the technical design of its protocols, interfaces, and algorithms; 2) corresponding mechanism for its efficient integration into the service layer of the Future Internet; 3) novel resolution infrastructure, allowing scalable look up and discovery of Internet-of-Things resources, entities of the real world, and their associations; 4) novel platform components; 5) implementation of real-life use cases demonstrating the benefits of the developed architecture.",0,0
64,94405,Yes,Science Education for Diversity,"Young people in Europe are not acquiring the scientific literacy they need to participate as citizens in democratic decision making about issues that involve science. In addition recruitment to careers in science is falling in Europe which is a challenge to Europe’s future in the knowledge economy We propose to learn how to respond to this situation in collaboration with international partners in countries where engagement with science education remains high. Understanding the dynamics of the relationships between culture, gender and science education in the diverse contexts offered by the countries brought together by this bid, the UK, the Netherlands, Turkey, Lebanon, India and Malaysia, will give us a good basis for designing new approaches to science education that will appeal to all students. We will develop a theoretical understanding of the relationship between cultural diversity, gender and science education and also provide guidelines for effective intervention to improve engagement with science education. One focus will be the impact of Islamic culture and religious belief in a range of contexts. We will use case study and design study approaches to understand the process whereby attitudes towards science are formed between the ages of 10 and 14. The evidence suggests that social networking technologies have contributed to creating a multiplicity of identities amongst young people in a way that can make the apparent unity and authority presented by school science appear irrelevant. In response we will explore using the same technology to engage young people in the real enterprise of science as shared enquiry across boundaries in a spirit of risk and dialogue where issues that matter to the future of the planet are at stake. The outcomes will be literature reviews, insights into how attitudes to science are formed, guidelines for curriculum and pedagogical development to encourage more people to engage with science education and examples of good practice.",1,1
224,189928,No,"Workers, Gypsies, and the Market: The Anthropology of New Fascism in Eastern Europe","This research focuses on how market transformation gives rise to new patterns of politics that among some social groups in Eastern Europe emerge as new fascism. By focusing on two social groups that have encountered the most significant transformation in effect of the economy re-structuring after state-socialism and whose positions caused the major challenges for academics and policy makers -- heavy industry workers and Roma/Gypsies -- the project aims to offer new perspective on the anthropology of social and political movements in Europe. Building upon years-long fieldwork in Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine, the project investigates how individualism and market calculation in what I call post-peasant setting after state-socialism have paved the way for populist movement that have increasingly taken anti-Roma attitudes among social groups that have not previously shown sensitivity to ethnic conflict or neo-fascist protests. The anthropology of new fascism therefore analyses the social and political movement from the ordinary perspective of everyday eceonomic models, balancing the dominant view on macro-structural or identity-centred 'culturalist' approaches. Theoretically, the project combines the recent dialogue of anthropology and economy with literature on transformations of polities, particularly in post-socialist setting. The project intends to argue that the current rise of populism and neo-fascism in Eastern Europe can only partially be explained as being the effect of neoliberal globalization. It is argued, instead, that the perspective on the everyday distribution of power in post-peasant society and how it has been reproduced via uneven development alongside with the changes in livelihood strategies under the market proliferation into the spheres previously dominated by community reciprocity shall be investigated in order to develop a new theory in the field of anthropology of social and political movements in/of Europe.",1,0

659,110251,No,Empirical Macro-Finance and the Financial Economics of Insurance Markets,"'My project consists of two lines of work. 1.Empirical Macro-Finance: Asset prices are informative about the macro-economic risks that matter to investors and about the welfare costs of economic fluctuations. However, recent empirical evidence suggests that leading asset pricing models cannot explain how risks are priced across maturities in equity markets, which is a key input to measuring the costs of business cycles. An analysis of what leading models miss will vastly improve our understanding of how the real economy and asset prices are related. Also, by expanding our empirical evidence about the term structure of equity to the firm-level, I plan to study how investment decisions relate to asset prices. My goal is to measure the firms' incentives to invest and how this impacts economic growth more broadly. 2.Financial Economics of Insurance Markets: Households in Europe and the US can choose from a wide variety of insurance products that insure health and mortality risks. Choosing between these products is no easy task and the costs from sub-optimal insurance choices are estimated to be large. My plan is to develop a comprehensive life-cycle theory of insurance choice that accounts for family structure, risk factors such as labor income and housing, and different institutional settings across countries. I also plan to study the supply side of insurance markets. The traditional view is that insurance prices are driven by life-cycle demand or informational frictions. However, as is clear from evidence during the financial crisis, insurance companies are in fact financial institutions. If financial constraints bind, it may affect insurance prices and ultimately consumers' welfare. My goal is to understand how financial frictions affect insurance companies. A policy implication of my research may be that the private supply of insurance is an imperfect substitute for public supply as insurance companies face different incentives and constraints than the government.'",1,0
81,87593,Yes,"Space, place and the historical and contemporary articulations of regional, national and European identities through work and community in areas undergoing economic restructuring and regeneration","SPHERE explores themes of identity and belonging: how do such alignments and affiliations survive (or not) the socio-economic changes that accompany restructuring and the broader political and demographic remodelling of Europe’s cultural landscapes? Its multidisciplinary analysis will deepen insight into the ways life experiences are interwoven with a range of cultural practices to construct new identities; it will also address the sources and implementation of regeneration policies for notions of community. SPHERE starts from six distinctive regional identities historically rooted in specific occupational contexts around strong communities in Europe’s largest economies: France, Germany, Poland, Spain, UK and Turkey. All have undergone profound socio-economic transformations with associated challenges to cultural identities and practices. The project focuses on changes to historic regional and cultural identities where regional regeneration projects have attempted to introduce new industries or services or jobs and to create new cultural and economic landscapes. To assess the impact of Europe on the complex evolutions of community, regional and national identities, some of the regions chosen accessed or use EU regeneration funding, while others relied largely either on regional or national state subsidies or on market processes. This research will trace the transition from older to newer industries and put a strong focus on the impact this has had on cultural identities linked to work, class and gender, as well as the effects of EU or other regeneration processes on understandings of place and on people’s sense of belonging. It will probe the conditions under which new occupational, community, national and/or European identities emerge. By drawing on both the humanities and social science, it goes further and asks questions about the complex interconnections of history, place, culture and identity within households, the community and its collective organisations.",1,1
435,111394,No,The Contribution of the Third Sector to Europe’s Socio-economic Development,"The main objective of the proposed research project is to create knowledge that will further advance the contributions that the third sector and volunteering can make to the socio-economic development of Europe. These unique ‘renewable resources’ for social and economic problem-solving and civic engagement in Europe are needed more than ever at this time of social and economic distress and enormous pressures on governmental budgets—not as an alternative to government but as a full-fledged partner in the effort to promote European progress. To take full advantage of this resource we need a clearer understanding of the third sector’s scope and scale, its existing and potential impacts, and the barriers to its full contributions to the continent’s common welfare. Building on our previous work, this project seeks to: 1) Clarify the concept of the third sector in its European manifestations; 2) Identify the major contours of the sector so defined—its size, structure, composition, sources of support, and recent trends; 3) Identify the impacts of this sector, its contributions to European economic development, innovation, citizen well-being, civic engagement, and human development, and to create capabilities to measure these contributions into the future; 4) Identify barriers both internal to organizations and external to them and suggest ways these barriers might be overcome; and 5) Forge a partnership between the research community and European Third Sector practitioners so that the understanding of the Third Sector generated by this work remains grounded in reality and enjoy sufficient support among key stakeholders to ensure respectful attention from policy makers and sector leaders long after the project is completed.  By drawing on the combined strengths of the academic community, government, and the third sector itself.

565,200483,No,"Analysis and control of large scale heterogeneous networks: scalability, robustness and fundamental limits","The proposed research will make a contribution towards the analysis and synthesis of large scale complex networks: fundamental theory will be developed and important applications will be addressed, by extending tools from control theory. Networks are present throughout the physical and biological world, but nowadays they also pervade our societies and everyday lives. Major challenges that will be addressed are:  I. The engineering of large scale heterogeneous networks that are guaranteed to be robust and scalable.   II. The reverse engineering of biological networks.  A distinctive feature of the networks we would like to engineer, which falls outside more traditional domains in systems and control, is that of scalability, i.e. the ability to guarantee robust stability for an arbitrary interconnection by conditions on only local interactions. The methodologies that will be developed will have a significant impact in various applications where scalability is important, such as data network protocols, group coordination problems and power distribution networks, as they can lead to network designs with guaranteed robustness, thus avoiding conservative schemes with poor performance. The proposed project will also make a contribution towards the reverse engineering of biological networks at the molecular level. Life in the cell is dictated by chance; noise is ubiquitous with its sources ranging from fluctuating environments to intrinsic fluctuations due to the random births and deaths of molecules. The fact that a substantial part of the noise is intrinsic provides a major challenge in control theoretic methodologies. How can feedback be used to suppress these fluctuations, what are the associated tradeoffs and limitations, and how does nature manage to handle these so efficiently? These are questions that will be addressed by developing tools for analyzing known configurations, but more importantly, by deriving fundamental limitations that hold for arbitrary feedback.",0,0
115,38953,Yes,Inclusion through participation,"The 2 years research project described in this application investigates the inclusion presumptions as well as the integrative impact of a range of social policies aimed at the inclusion of the unemploy3ed. It does this by confronting the views on and objectives of inclusion these policies embody with experiences of inclusion and exclusion of people participating in these policies. The project critically assesses the inclusion potentials of both paid and unpaid work - using a differentiated concept of work - for different social groups. It does this by:  - analyzing views on inclusion and exclusion underlying social integration policies;  - reviewing empirical research into experiences of inclusion and exclusion; - carrying out casestudies into experiences of inclusion and exclusion of different groups of people participating in different social policies stimulating participation in various kinds of work;  - making an international comparison (involving northern and southern European countries) between social policies and their impact.  The project will be executed by members of the SEDEC network which was established in 1993. Having exchanged and discussed theories of and research activities on inclusion, exclusion and citizenship in relation to social policies for several years, the partners of the network have been developing a common frame of reference which will facilitate carrying out this cross-national research project.   Apart from gaining insight into experiences of inclusion in relation to forms of participation as promoted by social policies, the project aims at generating policy recommendations of both EU and national relevance, regarding the 'inclusion potentials' of various forms of participation for various social groups. Although its main focus will be on the evaluation of the impact of social integration policies (subarea III.4), it will also contribute to knowledge on causes of social exclusion as well as on the relation between unemployment and exclusion (subarea III.2). Furthermore, it states reflection on methodological issues with respect to cross-national evaluations of social policies as one of its main objectives.

299,223836,No,Recording the Borders: Sounding Displacement and Integration in Europe,"Working at the intersections of music and refugee studies, RecBord examines soundscapes of displacement. It asks how sound mediates relations between refugee and host communities: How do experiences of forced migration manifest in sound? How do these sounds both enable and constrain processes of integration? Research and training take place in two European cities. It centres on Oslo, a target destination in many migration journeys into Europe. And it compares this with Athens, an arrival city in many of these same journeys. Arrivals and destinations, displacements and integrations – all have a soundtrack. RecBord gives focus to sound cultures in movement and circulation, pushing forward research in the developing field of music and migration studies.  RecBord argues that integration must be studied from the bottom up. It focusses on everyday lived experiences of displacement. It develops methods of doing anthropology in sound, using approaches of sensory ethnography and centring on the production of soundscape recordings made by research participants in the two case study cities. This is about understanding how refugees analyse and articulate their own experiences. And this in turn is about recognising the agency of those displaced.  Through training in academic excellence, human rights advocacy, and media outreach, RecBord aims to reach a diversity of listening publics: voicing new perspectives on migration, and disrupting dominant narratives of displacement.",1,0

Study environmental causes of NTD: a) Investigate the role of genetic factors in the association between folate metabolism and NTD using the mouse models; b) Carry out a retrospective and prospective review of neural tube defects and associated malformations in the offspring of women treated with the anticonvulsant sodium valproate in order to assemble a study group in which to evaluate the relationship between genotype, biochemical phenotype and predisposition to malformation Neural Tube defects (N'IDs) are a common group of malformations involving defective formation of the brain and spinal cord.  Anencephaly and spina bifida are the best-recognised examples. Marked variation in place and time, and association with dietary folate deficiency and specific teratogens such as anticonvulsant sodium valproate point to environmental causative factors. The description of a growing number of major NTD genes in the mouse, occasional monogenic human NTD syndromes and the significant excess in close relatives provide clear evidence in favour of a genetic component among the causative mechanisms. The INTEGER project will unite the multidisciplinary resources of the European Union in the search for these genes.  Their discovery will be a major step towards completion of the Human Genome Project; the rapid progress towards identification of simple monogenic genedefects exposes our lack of understanding of complex disorders such as birth defects. Discovery of the genes associated with abnormal development provides access to the developmental pathways of the normal human nervous system. Birth defects are a major health burden affecting 1 in 30 babies. NTDs are among the most common, varying from 1 in 3000 to more than 1 in 300 in recent studies in high-risk areas of Europe. The wide availability of obstetric ultrasound and therapeutic termination has served to obscure the prevalence of NTDs but has not diminished the psychological cost to more than 5,000 couples in the EU each year.  An understanding of the genetic basis of predisposition to this group of congenital anomalies will open the way to more effective targeting of preventive strategies. The INTEGER project brings together four major laboratory teams interested in NTDs in mouse and Man with a network of clinicians, epidemiologists and statistical geneticists. Two genes responsible for rare forms of monogenic NTD will be cloned and a large clinical resource established in which to investigate mutations in candidate genes. Several genes are recognised in the mouse as causing NTDs. As these are investigated, the murine research groups will screen the mouse genome for new NTD genes and explore their interaction with each other and with known environmental factors. Gene environment interaction in humans will be approached by the study of impaired folate metabolism and predisposition to malformation in pregnancies exposed to the anticonvulsant sodium evaporate.",0,0
937,207841,No,Exploring glycosidic neo-epitopes of degenerative hippocampal granules in aged mice and humans: implications for ageing and dementia,"Ageing is the main correlate of dementia and several other neurodegenerative diseases which currently affect more than 6 million people in Europe. Molecular understanding of these brain conditions is important for their prevention and treatment. In mice, pathological granular structures positive for periodic acid-Schiff stain have been found in the hippocampus with increasing age. The degenerative process of granule formation appears to originate in astrocytes, but adjacent neuronal structures are affected and, accordingly, associated memory impairments have been described. Recent studies reported that granules express glycosidic neo-epitopes, a hallmark of the degenerative granule formation process. This neo-epitope has additionally been found in Lafora bodies of a mouse model of Lafora disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition. On the other hand, mice serum contains natural IgM antibodies that recognise the glycosidic neo-epitope, suggesting a potentional removal mechanism. In this project, I aim to describe the structure of the glycosidic neo-epitopes of the hippocampal granules as well as the composition of the degenerative granules and Lafora bodies. To achieve these goals, I will employ a multidisciplinary approach exploiting glycomics and neurobiology, with the application of leading-edge technologies that include histological methods, analytical techniques, MALDI-MS imaging and laser-capture microdissection. Moreover, the binding patterns of the anti-neo-epitope natural IgMs will also be explored. Finally and importantly, the expression of the glycosidic neo-epitope in human brain will be assessed. Overall, the knowledge generated will provide new data on brain degenerative processes underlying age-related memory impairments in humans. Ultimately this project will generate new insights for the use of glycosidic neoepitopes as biomarkers for ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, and for prevention and therapeutic strategies using natural antibodies.",0,0
167,38959,No,European collaborative study on molecular genetics in affective disorders,"To study the genetics of Affective Disorders at the molecular level using the candidate gene strategy (mainly association and sib-pair methods) with relevant DNA polymorphic markers. To use molecular genetics to validate diagnostic subclassifications of affective disorders (phenotypic heterogeneity): from genotype to phenotype. To delineate gene-psychosocial environment interactions through different cultural settings across European centers. To consolidate and exploit a large European data bank of genetic, familial, clinical, psychosocial and psychopharmacological data available for Affective Disorders.   The understanding of genetic aspects of depression has benefited from recent findings with DNA markers. Affective disorders have been the subject of numerous studies using molecular genetics, covering a significant part of the genome. Most recent work suggests that several chromosomal regions may play a role in the etiology of Bipolar Affective Disorder. These regions of interest include genes on chromosomes 18, 21, 4, 5, 11 and X but have not yet been finally confirmed.   The main objective of this project is to test these hypotheses as well as new promising results in a powerful sample of patients with Bipolar and Unipolar depression recruited for association studies, in the framework of BIOMED1 collaborative project (EC Concerted Action on Affective Disorders: interaction between genetic and psychosocial vulnerability factors - Contract No BMH1-CT-92-1217 (1993-1996) - project leader: Prof. J. Mendlewicz). Genetic markers will be tested in a large European sample of patients and controls, already available for psychiatric genetic studies. This data bank of more than 1300 individuals with DNA available will be exploited in order to reach the main objective. This objective can only be achieved through a large scale multidisciplinary and multicenter effort. Eight European centers will collaborate in this research project. The large data base already available from these centers will allow rapid large scale investigations of genetic markers.  Selected genetic markers potentially involved in the genetic transmission of Affective Disorders (from association studies) will also be investigated through complementary strategies using sib-pair and linkage methods. Specific modes of inheritance such as anticipation and mutations (Trinucleotide Repeat Expansions) will also be studied in families and unrelated patients recruited for the project.  In addition, the quantitative effects of some relevant psychosocial vulnerability factors on gene expression will be evaluated through association, sib-pair and linkage analyses. This integrative approach offers the opportunity to properly explore the multifactorial aspects of mood disorders.   Affective disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with severe social disability and considerable mortality both with major economic impact. Etiology and risk factors of these disorders are not well known. Therefore, progress in psychiatric genetics and understanding of gene-psychosocial interactions could be of great benefit for public health.",0,0
294,208744,No,WhiteRabbit: easily revealing and managing personal information.,"WhiteRabbit aims to bring to the market an innovative software platform. The platform will allow to extract value from personal data, while keeping its subjects in the loop and also complying with upcoming regulations. In the last 20 years the use of personal data generated a big but not still well-regulated market; this has resulted in problems to companies and SMEs like the escalating complexity of data privacy management, the misuse of data and its social/legal consequences. The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, with its stricter rules, will introduce even higher complexity and costs for the management of personal data. In an ideal comparison with a well-known and regulated sector, the new software platform introduced by WhiteRabbit will work as an automated “tax accountant” helping companies to effectively deal with the complexity of regulations related to “tax returns”. Based on the prototype developed by the University of Trento within the “Smart Society” FET project, the WhiteRabbit project will bring such prototype to a further step of development through a new partnership with META Group, a leading company in the field of exploitation of research results, start-up creation, and access to finance. WhiteRabbit will validate the business model and design a commercialisation roadmap for the new start-up that will be launched by the team who developed the software platform’s original prototype. The consortium will then test the product in a market environment and finally will foster growth opportunities by pitching it to investors and potential customers. WhiteRabbit will generate an impact in terms of an innovation introduced into the market (the platform), the improvement of entrepreneurial mind-set (researchers becoming entrepreneurs within the start-up), and the stimulation of growth and jobs (a new start-up will be created).",0,0
245,106754,No,Fluid Flow in Complex and Curved Spaces,"In many natural and industrial situations, fluids in cavities, membranes or pipes of complex shape grow as well as modify the structures through which they flow. This leads to important challenges both fundamental, like biological morphogenesis, and practical, like the motion of nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS). We seek to substantially advance the understanding of the resulting shapes and instabilities. Our approach will focus on numerical methods, validated through theoretical and experimental analysis. Mathematically fluid-structure interactions involve ambitious moving boundary problems, where structure and fluid flow feedback on one another in complex ways. Detailed analysis requires precise modeling of coupling between very strongly de¬forming elasto-plastic solids and fluid flow in intricately curved spaces and solving both iteratively many times. To address this computational challenge, significant innovations will be implemented, including the use of novel erosion laws, the insertion of spatial curvature and metric directly into the equations of motion of the fluid, and special methods to handle the singular behaviour at kinks and constrictions. Our fluid solvers will be new variants of Lattice Boltzmann Models (LBM) coupled to temperature and concentration fields. The accuracy of the methods will be quantitatively validated by experiments. An unconventional hydrodynamic formulation for electronic currents will provide big advantages. We will develop LBM solvers for quantum and relativistic fluids and in particular create a Lattice Wigner model and couple it to the molecular dynamics of the support. Our method will open new horizons for the design of continuously regenerating filters, for shape optimi¬zation of heat exchangers and catalysts and for the engineering of electronic devices. Our approach will also shed light on sand avalanches in oil extraction, on aspects of folding in living matter, and on electromechanical instabilities.",0,0

Clinical praxis in disease-endemic countries (DEC) is rarely evidence based and does not make use of the latest innovations in diagnostic technology. NID–related research on diagnostics is particularly underfunded, and diagnostic tools are lacking for a number of NID. The aim of this proposal is to bridge the gap between existing technological innovation in diagnostics and clinical care practice for NID in resource-poor settings. The specific objectives are to develop simple, cost-effective diagnosis-treatment algorithms for three NID-related clinical syndromes: the persistent fever, the neurological and the digestive syndromes. Evidence-based algorithms for the primary care level will be designed with a patient-centred approach, following guidance from DEC stakeholders and making the best possible use of existing assays and treatments. Relevant diagnostic technology and diagnostic platforms will be introduced according to the specific epidemiological contexts in Africa and South-Asia. The research consortium brings together a network of clinical epidemiologists, a diagnostics development group, several partners from academia and SMEs. The consortium further includes workpackages on reference laboratory, economic evaluation, quality assurance and translation to policy. By developing accurate and affordable diagnostic platforms and by optimizing diagnostic-treatment algorithms, this project will rationalise treatment use, circumvent progression to severe presentations and thereby reduce NID morbidity/mortality and hinder the emergence of resistances.

While there is currently no clear strategy for curing such diseases, there are promising developments in the early diagnosis of disease and the inhibition of worsening symptoms. Building on results obtained during my post-doctoral work regarding laser technology for amyloid aggregates detection, I propose to use an advanced ultrafast spectroscopy for structural analyses of the peptides and proteins that form the different fibril architectures in the brains of patients with pathogenic aggregates. In combination with multiphoton absorption, this laser technique has the potential to detect and diagnose in a non-invasive modality the early forms of toxic oligomeric intermediates in the brains of persons with suspected Alzheimer´s or Parkinson´s disease. This methodology has potentially enormous benefits for patients and society. Importantly, the proposed approach of using high-intensity light in the infrared region of absorption does not damage cells and tissues during long-duration irradiation, it does not require the use of chemical labels, and it reduces the need for surgical intervention, as it is non-invasive and safe for human health. I will transfer the knowledge and expertise on biophotonics of amyloid fibrils to Europe and the Host laboratory at the Polish Academy of Science will provide me with advanced training in time-resolved ultrafast laser spectroscopy and access to newly designed setups, as well as supplementary career path-specific training in ancillary skills.",0,0

383,106297,No,Improving Outcome of Necrotizing Fasciitis: Elucidation of Complex Host and Pathogen Signatures that Dictate Severity of Tissue Infection,"The overall goal with INFECT is to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, prognosis, and diagnosis of the multifactorial highly lethal NSTIs. The fulminant course of NSTIs (in the order of hours) demands immediate diagnosis and adequate interventions in order to salvage lives and limbs. However, diagnosis and management are difficult due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation, in co-morbidities and in microbiological aetiology. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in order to improve outcome of NSTIs. To achieve this, a comprehensive and integrated knowledge of diagnostic features, causative microbial agent, treatment strategies, and pathogenic mechanisms (host and bacterial disease traits and their underlying interaction network) is required. INFECT is designed to obtain such insights through an integrated systems biology approach in patients and different clinically relevant experimental models.  Specific objectives of INFECT are to: 1. Unravel specific mechanisms underlying diseases signatures though a bottom-up systems approach applied to clinically relevant experimental settings 2. Apply a top-down systems biology approach to NSTI patient samples to pin-point key host and pathogen factors involved in the onset and development of infection 3. Identify and quantify disease signatures and underlying networks that contribute to disease outcome 4. Exploit identified disease traits for the innovation of optimized  diagnostic tools 5. Translate the advanced knowledge generated into evidence-based guidelines for classification and management, and novel therapeutic strategies  We have gathered a team of multidisciplinary researchers, clinicians, SMEs and a patient organization, each with a unique expertise, technical platform and/or model systems that together provide the means to successfully conduct the multifaceted research proposed and efficiently disseminate/exploit the knowledge obtained.",0,0
474,105418,No,Inclusions in diamonds: messengers from the deep Earth,"Diamonds and their inclusions are the deepest materials originating from the Earth’s interior reaching the surface of our planet. Their study plays a key role in understanding and interpreting the geodynamics, geophysics, petrology, geochemistry and mineralogy of the Earth’s mantle and those processes which governed trough the time the evolution of the Earth. The most abundant mineral inclusions in diamonds are olivines, orthopyroxenes, clinopyroxenes, garnets, spinels, and sulfides. All of these mineral phases have been identified by X-ray diffraction or electron microprobe analysis since the 1950’s almost always after their extraction from the diamonds. However, a non-destructive in-situ investigation of an inclusion in diamond is useful and important because: (a) some mineral inclusions under pressure could have a different crystal structure, and thus different petrologic significance compared to that at ambient pressure; (b) the internal pressure on the inclusion can provide information about the formation pressure of the diamond; (c) the morphology and growth relationships of the inclusion with the host diamond can provide indications about its protogenetic vs. syngenetic and/or epigenetic nature. In this project a new experimental approach, based on X-ray diffraction technique, will be used in order to determine, for the first time, the crystal structure of the inclusions still trapped in their host diamonds allowing to obtain chemical information capable to provide the inclusion remnant pressure and, from this, the pressure of formation of the diamond-inclusion pair. At the same time, our approach will allow to obtain any possible epitaxial relationship between diamond and its inclusions in order to provide strong constraints about the syngenetic or protogenetic nature of minerals included in diamond solving a 50 years old debate. Several geochemical and geodynamical models are based on the assumption of syngenesis but this has yet to be demonstrated.",0,0
350,209495,No,Bayesian Agent-based Population Studies: Transforming Simulation Models of Human Migration,"The aim of BAPS is to develop a ground-breaking simulation model of international migration, based on a population of intelligent, cognitive agents, their social networks and institutions, all interacting with one another. The project will transform the study of migration – one of the most uncertain population processes and a top-priority EU policy area – by offering a step change in the way it can be understood, predicted and managed. In this way, BAPS will effectively integrate behavioural and social theory with modelling.  To develop micro-foundations for migration studies, model design will follow cutting-edge developments in demography, statistics, cognitive psychology and computer science. BAPS will also offer a pioneering environment for applying the findings in practice through a bespoke modelling language. Bayesian statistical principles will be used to design innovative computer experiments, and learn about modelling the simulated individuals and the way they make decisions.  In BAPS, we will collate available information for migration models; build and test the simulations by applying experimental design principles to enhance our knowledge of migration processes; collect information on the underpinning decision-making mechanisms through psychological experiments; and design software for implementing Bayesian agent-based models in practice. The project will use various information sources to build models bottom-up, filling an important epistemological gap in demography.  BAPS will be carried out by the Allianz European Demographer 2015, recognised as a leader in the field for methodological innovation, directing an interdisciplinary team with expertise in demography, agent-based models, statistical analysis of uncertainty, meta-cognition, and computer simulations. The project will open up exciting research possibilities beyond demography, and will generate both academic and practical impact, offering methodological advice for policy-relevant simulations.",0,0
673,78617,No,Registration of Biological Control Agents,"Biological control agents (BCAs) are sustainable and environmentally safe tools to manage pest insects, nematodes, weeds and diseases in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. However, registration procedures have been established for micro-organisms, semiochemicals and botanicals, which prevent their market introduction. Registration largely follows rules developed for synthetic pesticides, thus many possibly irrelevant investigations are requested. Costly risk assessment studies and long term evaluation of dossiers keep these products off the market. The time frame for the EU evaluation of dossiers according to Directive 91/414/EEC is > 70 months compared with ca. 23 months for the same products in the USA. Due to their nature and specificity of action, BCAs should not be treated like synthetic chemicals and therefore need a different approach for risk assessment and regulation. The objective of the Action REBECA is to accelerate the regulation process for BCAs and make it more cost-effective without compromises to the level of safety. The Action will review current legislation, guidelines and guidance documents at Member State and EU level and compare them with legislation in countries where the market introduction of BCAs was more successful. Potential risks of BCAs will be reviewed and proposals are prepared on how regulation of BCAs can be balanced according to their potential hazards. Costs and benefits related to different levels of regulation will be reviewed and trade-offs evaluated. Alternative regulation strategies will be developed for low risk products. The action will bring together stakeholders from industry, science, regulation authorities, policy and environment to form a network within Europe bringing together the expertise and critical mass necessary to improve regulation procedures for BCAs. The action will identify future research tools to support the development of balanced regulation strategies.",0,0
6,205939,Yes,Incubate a New Learning and Inspiration Framework for Education,"INLIFE will provide an innovative gamification framework targeting both typical as well as special education and social inclusion activities based on Serious Games. INLIFE’s core concept leverages on the potential of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm to directly link actions, decisions and events happening in real-life with in-game educational progress and modern gaming technologies. This bridge strengthens the infusion of gamification into non-leisure contexts, boosting at the same time the creation of new educational methodologies as well as new business opportunities. The challenge INLIFE addresses is to effectively join the forces of gaming industries, IoT technologies and social science research outcomes to support the development of creative and effective applications in education and for social inclusion.  The INLIFE framework will be based on an open, layered architecture, consisting of modules supporting agile abstraction methods, model-driven development and transformation technologies, as well as state-of-the-art gaming and human-computer interaction techniques. It will enable the bidirectional, real time communication between the serious game and the surrounding environment, bringing the player in the center of the game while living the reality.  The INLIFE technologies, tools and software solutions will be validated in four carefully set pilots through the integration and demonstration of two selected serious games, one for the education of children and students on environmental sustainability and one targeted at assisting children with autism to learn, thus facilitating their social inclusion. The realization of the INLIFE vision will ultimately pave the way for the proliferation of new innovative IoT-based serious games, created also by third parties, featuring enhanced gameplays and educational efficacy, thus establishing new market opportunities for involved stakeholders.",0,1
258,83386,No,"Exploring visual cognition: A combined neuropsychological, behavioural, hemodynamic and modelling approach","In the last two decades, connectionist modelling in cognitive science has grown ever more sophisticated. At the same time, recent neuroimaging techniques and related statistical analyses make it possible to explore the neural substrates of complex cognitive processes in humans.  Of these techniques, fMRI has one of the most rapidly growing potentials because of its performance for high spatial resolution and whole-brain measurements. Combining neural network modelling and brain imaging will allow us to examine the functional constraints and interactions known to exist in distributed brain architectures.  The main goal of this project is to characterize the functional neurophysiology of the human perceptual and cognitive system related to attention and emotion/motivation states during behavioural and neural changes associated with the learning of visual perceptual skills.  The project addresses three theoretical and experimental issues: - the development of connectionist models in close relationship with neurophysiological and behavioural data, - the coupling of this modelling approach with new empirical experiments and - the behavioural study of hemianopic patients based on results obtained in issues (1) and (2).  The first aim of this project is exploring the neural circuitry from the retina to subsequent cortical and subcortical areas and specifically the computational efficiency of magnocellular vs parvocellular neural pathways for facial expression processing. Complementary, the second aim consists of modelling the effect of top-down attentional feedback on low-level visual processes.",0,0
553,217328,No,Multi-sensory experiences for in-home therapy and entertainment,"Multi-Sensory Environments (MSEs) is a discipline of occupational therapy that helps treat cognitive and sensory deficiencies (in memory, attention, social interaction…) of people with developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, neuro-degenerative diseases and or brain-injuries. These conditions which include autism, dementia, Down syndrome or multiple sclerosis affect over 15% of the population (1,1bn people worldwide).   Through a controlled environment for sensory stimulation (that combine sound, vibration, light and multimedia content), MSEs are not only a room or space for therapy but also a real entertainment option for people with sensory or cognitive disabilities who often are not able to enjoy movies, videogames, books… MSEs have become popular at special schools, hospitals, care centres, etc. However, the majority of people with sensory and/or cognitive deficiencies live at home. That means they can only benefit from MSEs during a very limited amount of time.   MOMENTS aims to bring the benefits of MSEs directly to the homes of end-users. It plans to do so by launching into the market the first lower-scale (and therefore affordable) MSE product. The in-home product will be supported by a unique intelligent system capable of recommending immersive stimulating experiences that adapt to the physical, cognitive and sensory functions of each user (providing more targeted stimulation and easing operation by family members and/or carers). The overall ambition is not only making MSE therapy available 24/7 but also delivering “inclusive entertainment”.  The company behind the project is BJ Adaptaciones, an SME specialised in developing and commercialising technologies for people with disabilities, with a track record in international sales. Through MOMENTS, the company expects to generate an accumulated turnover of 25M€ in 5 years, consolidating their position as a leading innovator in multi-sensory environments in Europe and beyond.",0,0

A portable imaging system will offer safety, environmental & economic benefits to the gas industry in locating leak sources, from both high & low-pressure mains, compared with currently available point measurement instrumentation. Our route towards this ambitious goal has three synergistic stages : - (a) Passive IR imaging will be used to shoot videos of gas leaks in controlled conditions. This will improve our understanding of leak behaviour & will be supported by numerical models, enabling better instrument design & working practices. (b) A remote laser pointer will be developed using novel DFB laser diodes to measure the spectral absorption of methane in the laser beam.

230,3764,No,NEW LIQUID CRYSTAL POLYMER/ELASTOMER COMPOSITES,"The programme is designed to verify the possibility of using Liquid Crystal Polymers (LCPs) both as processing aids and reinforcing agents of conventional elastomers.  Blends of technical articles were obtained by compounding LCPs and fluoroelastomers (FE).  1) Qualitative and quantitative information on processing aid effect of different LCPs structures, when blended with different elastomers, were achieved: viscosity of melt blends is constantly much lower than that of FE alone; semirigid LCPs gave the best results.  2) Achievements of self reinforcing composite does not depend on the production of fibrillar LCPs species: excellent reinforcement were obtained probably due to a reaction between LCPs and FEs.  3) A promising prospect exists for the generation of new composite materials which possess cost/performance better than FEs alone.   Blends for tyre compounds were studied.  1) Both qualitative and quantitative information on processing aid effect of different LCPs structures, when blended with natural rubber and SBR has been obtained; clearly the addition of LCPs in the compounds results in a significant decrease in the measured viscosity of the compounds (advantage: reduction of energy consumption during the fabrication of rubber goods).  2) This study has shown that LCP fibers can be formed in the rubber matrix during the extrusion process and the mechanical properties of the LCP/rubber compounds can be improved through the formation of in-situ fibers into the matrix. However more work needs to be carried out again. In fact, in this study, temperatures much higher than the typical processing temperatures were used in the extrusion of the LCP containing rubber compounds (namely SBR and natural rubber) and higher level of antidegradants and less active accelerators had to be used in order to prevent excessive oxidation and early scorch of the compounds during the extrusion process. The main goals are:  -the creation of reinforcing species in the elastomeric matrix during processing by taking advantage of the fibrous morphology of LCPs  -the use of mild processing conditions due to the low viscosity of LCPs, by saving energy while avoiding possible damage of products and machines  -the production of satisfactory adhesion between reinforcing species and elastomeric matrices, and consequently, out standing performances in comparison with conventionally reinforced elastomers.   Intermediate goals are:  -synthesis of tailored structures of LCPs  -design of machines for a proper processing of LCPs and elastomers  -development of optimal processing conditions  -evaluation of the new materials performances in pneumatic tyre prototypes and in technical articles.",0,0

213,202884,No,"Legitimacy, Sovereignty and the Public Sphere","The goal of the research is to redefine the interrelations between the concepts of legitimacy, sovereignty, the public sphere and democracy in order to develop a conception of a more inclusive and participatory public sphere. The problems of participation in and inclusivity of the public sphere relate to recent trends of globalisation and democratic development in general. As for the latter it has been argued that democracy is hijacked by corporate interests and party bureaucracies that make decisions in their back rooms, excluding all public discussion, and as for the former, we can observe how globalisation brings together different peoples, cultures, religions, highlighting the question of openness to and acceptance of differences. This research project proceeds from understanding that tackling these issues means to deal with the problems of inclusivity and participation in the public sphere.  This project differs from various re-conceptualisations of the public sphere or sovereignty that have been offered in response to these concerns. It returns to the original condition of possibility of the concept of the public sphere: my argument is that the mentioned problems with inclusivity and participation emanate from the unfinished conceptual separation between state and society. I argue further that the idea of legitimacy has to be tackled, if this conceptual separation is to be brought to its conclusion. My theoretical approach to these issues will be a conceptual analysis informed by Derridean deconstruction. This project is innovative as it is interdisciplinary in using conceptual tools of philosophy to reinterpret terms which are in use in our everyday political practice. The process of carrying out the research plan that also foresees publishing four scholarly articles and the completion of one book manuscript will significantly develop further my skills and knowledge, making me better equipped to contribute to European science.",0,0

618,93969,No,"European Science and Technology in Action Building Links with Industry, Schools and Home","The aim of ESTABLISH is to facilitate and implement an inquiry based approach in the teaching and learning of science and technology across Europe, mainly focussed, through the collaborative actions of the consortium, on appropriate teacher education and support using trialled and tested resource material particularly suited to inquiry based teaching. Inquiry based teaching methodologies are encouraged to engage students in science and mathematics by increasing their interest in science and also by stimulating teacher motivation. However, widespread implementation of such a methodology will only occur with inclusion and participation of all partners in education, both formal and informal. ESTABLISH addresses this by drawing together over 60 partners from across 11 European countries to work together on a 48 month multidisciplinary project to encourage and promote the more widespread use of inquiry-based science teaching techniques in second level schools through appropriate teacher education, creation of authentic learning environments and actions to bridge the gap between the science education research community, science teachers, students, parents, local industry as well as policy makers in order to facilitate the uptake of inquiry-based science teaching. The outcomes of this project will firstly be a large team of teachers across Europe who are skilled and confident in their delivery of inquiry based teaching. Further outcomes will be the identification of suitable model(s) of teacher education, at both pre- and in-service levels, for inquiry based teaching and also identification of best practice in guiding change through all the stakeholders involved in science and science education.

17,212877,Yes,Current European and Cross-National Comparative Research and Research Actions on Migration,"Migration and the characteristics which constitute its parameters, dynamics and complexities comprises one of the most paramount matters in contemporary Europe. Under these designated circumstances, the necessity of relevant, concise, and useful knowledge are prerequisites for the design of efficient and constructive policies. Although particular databases such as EUROSTAT and OECD offer valuable insights into these migratory dynamics, a comprehensive, efficient and integrative database which synthesizes, categorizes and maps out the vast analytical accounts on migration throughout Europe is non-existent. This project, bringing together 16 leading research institutions, networks and policy institutes throughout Europe, aims to proficiently fulfill this gap crucial for policy-purposes through the construction of a central migration hub. This hub will be of instrumental value due to its capability to operate as a key grammar in the design of current and future policy. Essentially, it accumulates and consolidates past, present and future migration research through providing an extensive yet succinct overview of migration drivers, infrastructures, flows, and policies, allowing for an improved systematic understanding of the factors that constitute the interaction between these analytical categories. The accessibility, accumulation and integration of research in one hub will be an integral element for improved policy making as it concentrates and visualizes relevant data – thereby facilitating information acquisition in pursuance of policy oriented goals. As of such, a continuous research-policy dialogue is prevalent throughout the construction of the hub, an insight which enables its users to visualize and develop migration scenarios- entailing a classification system for migration research.  Consequently, the project aims to shape a strategic research agenda on migration as it will identify gaps, overlaps and connections within the available stock of migration research",0,1
849,57966,No,Vision and Hearing Impairment: Rehabilitation Engineering and Support Technologies for Independent Living,"European society has a vision of extending equal opportunities to all citizens, including those with learning difficulties and/or physical impairments. This is becoming increasingly important due to a growth in the proportion of the population with age related disabilities as a result of increased longevity, in particular hearing and vision loss and concomitant reduced mobility. In younger people hearing loss is occurring more frequently due to exposure to high volume noise. There are two different categories of barriers to equal opportunities: physiological ones resulting from the nature of the disability and attitudinal ones resulting in prejudice and discrimination. Technological aids and assistive devices are vital in overcoming the physiological barriers and giving people with disabilities the physical capacity and psychological confidence to live and work independently. Other measures will be required to change attitudes and overcome prejudice and discrimination. This Conference Series focuses on the research needed to develop and extend technological aids and assistive devices to facilitate independent living and working, and participation in all aspects of society and community life by the hearing and vision impaired.  The objectives of the Conference Series are: - To explore and describe the societal inaccessibility problems caused by hearing and sight loss; - To focus on how the technological engineering disciplines can and are being used to provide assistance to those with hearing and sight impairment or loss; - To determine and initiate the new engineering and technological research and development needed to resolve outstanding problems in assistive technologies; - To provide training for young researchers in assistive technologies; - To help researchers to keep up-to-date with new developments in assistive technologies for people with hearing and/or sight impairments; - To provide a workshop interface between social science, medicine, human factors, design and technological areas such as communications, mechanical and electronics engineering.",1,0
728,227450,No,Device-Centric Low-Complexity High-Frequency Networks,"The evolution from 5G to the next-generation wireless system will call for a more radical change than any occurred among the previous generations: at the network level, flexible device-centric architectures will alleviate the need for centralized coordination; at the device level, operating frequencies will massively migrate to mmWave bands to exploit the large amount of available bandwidth. The project's core idea is that the design of a flexible network architecture and the implementation of low-complexity, energy-efficient mmWave hardware are interconnected physical-layer research problems. The proposed project thus represents the first attempt towards the joint network- and device-level design and optimization of beyond-5G wireless systems. Its ultimate goal is to provide a unified view of the types of network and hardware that are necessary to deliver tailored services for current and emerging wireless applications under a common and sustainable physical infrastructure. More specifically, it has the following main objectives: i) develop new theoretical knowledge on application-specific device coordination and novel distributed resource allocation schemes to support the coexistence of network- and device-centric mechanisms; ii) provide new analytical insights into the performance-complexity tradeoff in beam-space processing and low-resolution ADCs/DACs for mmWave communications; iii) analyze the interplay between network- and device-level design parameters for a given service/application. Relevant emerging wireless frameworks, such as cell-free massive MIMO and D2D-aided multicasting, will be considered.

801,110636,No,A Decarbonisation Platform for Citizen Empowerment and Translating Collective Awareness into Behavioural Change,"A lack of collective awareness negatively impacts perceived personal efficacy, which hampers efforts to address societal problems. DecarboNet is a multidisciplinary effort to tackle this problem by identifying determinants of collective awareness, translating awareness into behavioural change, and providing novel methods to analyse and visualise the underlying processes. The project's core innovations are built around a context-specific repository of carbon reduction strategies. This 'decarbonisation methodology' will increase awareness not only of existing problems, but also of best-practice solutions and the impact of individual actions. To continuously refine this repository, the collective awareness platform of DecarboNet will utilise citizen-generated content in a societal feedback loop that enables an adaptive process of social innovation.<br/>Supporting and understanding this process at various levels of granularity requires significant technological advances, including (i) generic tools to co-create knowledge with on-the-fly recommendations of related content from multiple sources; (ii) a cross-platform social media application to provide eco-feedback and engage citizens in games with a purpose; and (iii) methods to measure and predict behavioural change, and to capture collective awareness in a quantitative framework based on diffusion models and resonance patterns in public discourse.<br/>To assess engagement strategies, two use cases will contrast the effectiveness of competition-based and cooperative approaches in a grassroots experiment to measure energy consumption (Energy Quest) and a large-scale awareness campaign (Earth Hour).

717,206722,No,Cultural roots and institutional transformations of teachers’ careers and the teaching profession in Europe,"The teaching profession is central to a number of major issues concerning the possible futures of educational systems.  The functioning of the profession suffers from low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This proposal constitutes the first systematic comparative project in Europe aimed at understanding the role of the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the teaching profession as a whole.   It has four objectives: [1] to explain the nature of teacher policy over the last thirty years in different educational systems (Belgium, France and England); [2] to understand the changing status of the teaching profession and its impact on the diversification of the teaching workforce; [3] to analyse the processes by which teachers are allocated into increasingly diverse working and professional conditions; and [4] to model and predict teacher attrition and migration within a common but differentiated multilevel framework.   This project will adopt a post-comparative mixed-method design organized around four work packages on teacher policy, supply, labour markets and mobility. It will combine five methods: policy analysis of teachers’ recruitment and careers; secondary data analyses of relevant national and international datasets on teacher supply and the profession’s attractiveness; a qualitative, in-depth study of three national labour-market spaces; multilevel multi-group analyses of original datasets on teacher mobility, and semi-structured interviews with non-entrants and early leavers.  This project will produce new theoretical knowledge about labour markets for teachers and contribute to the reconceptualization of the nature of institutional change affecting educational systems in a society characterized by the progressive decline of nation states, increased interdependence between societal fields and the fragmentation of individual life spheres.",1,0
721,2437,No,Very high efficiency multibandgap solar cells based on III-V compounds including growth on alternative substrates,"Demonstrate the feasibility of very high efficiency solar energy photovoltaic conversion (above 30%) by means of tandem cells epitaxially grown in III-V materials. Study the possibilities of cost reduction by means of heteroepitaxy on cheap substrates.  Several methods of fabricating 3-terminal, gallium arsenide and silicon tandem solar cells were explored. Firstly, epitaxial life off (ELO) was employed to transplant high efficiency solar cells to alternative substrates. Although this technique was successful with layers as thin as 500 nm, problems arose with cells larger than 1 cm{2} due to stresses induced when the wax carrier was removed.  A new lift off technique was developed, mesa release and deposition (MRO) which combines the heteroepitaxial growth process for gallium arsenide on silicon with the possibility of removing the epitaxial layer from the substrate, relieving the thermally induced stress from the heteropitaxial layer. This method also proved unsuitable for areas larger than 5 mm{2}. It was concluded that neither ECO nor MRD was better than gallium arsenide cells grown directly on silicon.  In the third approach, the stacked cell process (SCP), the gallium arsenide cell was grown on a gallium arsenide substrate and glued face down to a silicon cell using transparent, space grade silicone rubber, after which the substrate was etched away. Spinning the silicone layer proved unsatisfactory, since air bubbles remained. Better results were obtained by using a droplet of silicone and damping the materials to be glued. An intermediate terminal was provided either by including a metal foil between the 2 cells during the gluing process, or by using a spot of conductive glue.  Transparent top cell contacts on the gallium arsenide layer were tested. A low temperature screen printing technique was devised to protect the glue, which can tolerate a maximum of 200 C.  Very high efficiency solar cells were developed. Gallium arsenide doped with tellurium was used to make a high energy tandem cell. A new annealing procedure was developed. The best cell produced had an efficiency of 26%. A wide band gap cell was made using (aluminium, gallium) arsenide. Minority carrier lifetime proved to be very sensitive to growth temperature; epitaxy must therefore be performed at high temperature.  A mechanically stacked tandem of gallium arsenide and (gallium, indium) arsenide was constructed. Stacking was carried out in 2 steps. First, each cell was mounted on an independent support. Secondly, the supports were stacked. Each support was made of 2 squared copper slabs. The cell was glued onto the bottom slab with a conduction epoxyde resin (back contact). The upper slab was glued onto the bottom one with an epoepoxyde resin with electrical insulation and thermal conduction properties. The stacking of both supports was realized with an electrical isolating resin and optical alignment was optimized by observing the bottom cell photocurrent while moving one support, before the resin reticulation phase.  Silicon was used as the substrate for gallium arsenide cells by means of the aluminium arsenide nucleation technique. Various methods were employed to reduce the residual stress between the lattices. Use of an intermediate buffer layer was best. The buffer was gallium (arsenide, phosphide) (Ga(As(1-x)Px)), where x can be calculated from the thermal expansion coefficients of the cell and substrate.  A material study of the growth of gallium arsenide solar cells on germanium substrates by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy has been made. The influence of the substrate misorientation, substrate cleaning process, growth procedure and initial growth conditions on the properties of the grown material have been investigated. To grow material with a good morphology and a long minority carrier lifetime, growth must be performed at a rate of 30 nm/minute with a ratio V/III of 45. Incorporation of indium into the gallium arsenide, forming indium gallium arsenide (in (0.016) Ga (0.984) As) permitted a lattice match, and hence no misfit dislocations.  Optimization for solar cell application was investigated. The gallium arsenide was protected from autodoping by coating the germanium substrate with silicon oxide (SiO2). Control of undesirable gallium arsenide to germanium interface properties was achieved by using a high doping level of substrate, a long annealing time before growth, and a low mital growth temperature. One cell showed a very good short circuit current, and a reasonable open circuit voltage (1.08 V), corresponding to an efficiency of 9.28%, which was low due to the poor quality of the window layer. With an improved window layer such a cell would give an efficiency of nearly 20%.  A 2-junction monolithic tandem solar cell in a 3-terminal configuration based on the aluminium gallium arsenide and gallium arsenide system has been developed. The cell is made of a liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) grown p-n-p stack of layers. The upper cell, bandgap 1.89 eV, presents an aluminium gallium arsenide (Al(0.32)Ga(0.68)As) p-n junction obtained by diffusion of beryllium in a tin doped layer during an isothermal process. The cell was specifically designed to work in linear concentrators. The device had a trial efficiency of 26.6% at 40 AM1.5D. It exhibited an increased blue response due to the thin front surface window. The high value of the diffusion length in LPE grown materials made feasible the suppression of the collection grid, but since it was found that conversion efficiency was limited by the series resistance, it was concluded that a collection grid was necessary to improve the efficiency.  An attempt was made to grow aluminium gallium arsenide layers by LPE on aluminium gallium arsenide on silicon substrates. The major difficulty encountered was the partial dissolution of the silicon substrate into the growth liquid bath. This programme is the continuation of the 1986-1989 Alterna action. The present research is essentially based on Metallorganic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE)  The central photovoltaic material of the project is GaAs.   I. Very high efficiency.   Two aspects of achieving high efficiency will be investigated:   A) Monolithic integration  The GaAs solar cell efficiency can be improved by growing an additional large gap cell on top of GaAs (Al,Ga)As and specially (Al,Ga,In)P alloys will investigated for two- and three-terminal monolithic tandems.    B) Mechanically stacking  This technique will be developed for the coupling of cells obtained in the past Alterna action and the present JOULE Programme, involving the III-V (Al,Ga)As, (Al,Ga,In)P, (Ga,In)As, (Ga,In)(As,P).   II. Cost reduction of III-V compound-based cells.   Silicon and germanium will be used as alternative substrates for the grown of:   A) GaAs/Si(Al,Ga)As/Si (growth techniques MOVPE and Liquid phase Epitaxy).   B) GaAs on Ge and also GaAs on Ge on Si.  The GaAs/Si heteroepitaxial growth raises difficult problems lattice accommodation between 2 materials, whereas GaAs and Ge are lattice-matched. on both substrate materials will be investigated.",0,0
348,99477,No,Design and Preparation of Functional Molecules for Quantum Computing and Information Processing,"The future of Nanotechnology depends inevitably on the creation of molecular devices capable of performing crucial functions. We propose new strategies for the design and synthesis of molecular functional materials based on coordination chemistry, as well as the study of their physico-chemical properties in order to evaluate their relevance in the context of molecular spintronics and electronics. The main rationale underlying these strategies stems from the conviction that the unlimited potential of coordination compounds may be greatly exploited if the processes of self assembly leading to these systems are controlled and manipulated through the careful design of the ligands that will shape their structure and properties. We have designed the synthesis of new families of multinucleating ligands intended to form polynuclear coordination molecules with predetermined structures. Preliminary analysis of their performance has served to identify entries into novel categories of Single Molecule Magnets, SMMs, and Molecular Cluster Pairs, MCPs. The latter are stable molecules that exhibit two quasi independent metallic clusters, which fulfil many of the requirements necessary to act as 2qbit quantum gates for processors in quantum computing. We propose a full synthetic programme aimed at exploiting and expanding this promising avenue toward the fabrication of molecular systems that will be exploited in the context of Quantum Information Processing, QIP. In particular, we have identified from our previous work three classes of MCPs with promising features towards that end. We aim at exploiting the tools that we have created and develop new synthetic resources for the synthesis of robust molecules with the ability to act as 2qbits in QIP based on magnetic nanoclusters.",0,0
469,30552,No,SME and Regional Telecom Support,"The strategic objective of SMARTS is to increase the participation of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the work and exploitation of results from ACTS. Participation in the framework of this project is defined as:  full partnership or subcontractor in a new or established ACTS project; triggered usage of broadband technologies (including link services) in their own proprietary technology base; attendance at ACTS events; use of broadband technology products and services by non-technically based SMEs (e.g. tourism); engineers and scientists from SMEs joining ACTS projects and trials as guest researchers. Four main results: SMARTS designed a user-friendly tool that enables SMEs to engage easily in electronic commerce; this tool was officially introduced to the public at the G7 Conference in Bonn in April 1997; SMARTS is promoting SME participation in ACTS and assisting the organisation of regional 'marriage brokering' events; A fully operational Participation Broker service system is being used by SMEs Europe-wide; An electronic news and information service containing information on ACTS relevant to European SMEs has been implemented. Expected Impact The provision of information in and around ACTS customised to the needs of SMEs is expected to increase the participation of SMEs in ACTS. By offering the necessary communication services to SMEs and actors in ACTS, SMARTS will lower the barrier for SMEs to establish and maintain a continuous working relationship with the ACTS community and to utilise advanced communications technologies and services. The SMARTS consortium includes a number of EU SMEs as well as partners from Central and Eastern European countries, thus encouraging and promoting the use of ACTS results in electronic commerce uptake beyond the EU borders. Technical Approach The project will achieve these strategic goals by adopting three strategies aimed at lowering the barriers of remoteness, poor infrastructure and inability to fund the overhead of direct partnership in an ACTS project by:  organising a 'Participation Broker' based on advanced communications technologies and services driven by the needs of SMEs offering services via a European network, with access points also in Central and Eastern European countries; performing a News and Information Service on topics and items related to ACTS and advanced communications which is of interest especially to SMEs who want to participate in ACTS; previous experience in this type of activities has been gained in the Telework Stimulation Action; actively promoting the participation of SMEs in the work of ACTS by increasing awareness among SMEs regarding opportunities offered in advanced communications, by brokering consortia with SME participation and by offering on-line SME support services to ease their burden and overhead of participation. Summary of Trial The objective of the SMARTS Trial is to implement and test the project's 'Participation Broker' as a service to demonstrate how to promote, facilitate and manage SME participation in ACTS using advanced communications technologies and services. The 'Participation Broker' will offer video-conferencing, joint editing, e-mail, database access, tele-translation, a multimedia catalogue and a multilingual user interface via a European network of 50 points of presence (POPs) involving some 5000 SMEs as users across Europe during the lifetime of the project. Key Issues Continually re-assess SME needs and requirements concerning SMARTS services, with a particular focus on electronic commerce; promote, manage and facilitate participation of SMEs in ACTS; trigger usage of broadband services and applications by SMEs; provide information services for participation brokerage on common networks and media; approach the European SME community with a series of regional and European events; support participating SMEs and guest researchers with services for location-independent work facilitate participation of SMEs in electronic commerce.",0,0
667,110582,No,Molecular Imaging of Brain Pathophysiology,"BRAINPATH aims to build upon current developments in molecular imaging by creating an academic-industrial training and mobility network for the next revolution of imaging technology. Molecular in vivo imaging is a fertile area which combines expertise, state-of-art equipment and many disciplines and inter-sector work environments. Our goal is to better understand brain diseases and develop new preclinical imaging strategies. We believe optical imaging in particular represents a technology that has the potential to exploit further our knowledge in this area. Our main objective is to train a new generation of medical imaging scientists who, within the next 10-15 years, will bring optical brain imaging to the clinic. Indeed, it is envisaged that in the future optical imaging will be implemented as the fourth clinical modality in conjunction with the three already established clinical imaging techniques of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Molecular in vivo neuro-imaging is rather underdeveloped, with its challenges specific to working on the brain, compared with other organs. Optical imaging can potentially play an important role in the multimodal orchestra together with MRI, PET and CT. Light can be used to measure functional aspects of the brain by either intrinsic monitoring of physiological changes, e.g. fluorescence, absorption, or by external contrast such as the use of fluorescence probes. Importantly, optical imaging is generally non-invasive and the equipment needed for such measurements are of low cost. A final unmet need is to integrate the different imaging modalities so that complementary information can be obtained from each modality. BRAINPATH will address this need and provide novel opportunities for treating important brain diseases. We will exploit this potential through transfer of knowledge between disciplines and sectors through training a next generation of imaging scientists.",0,0
720,101808,No,"Self-care Support for People with Long Term Conditions, Diabetes and Heart Disease: A Whole System Approach","The overall aim of this project is to offer a deeper understanding of the different mechanisms involved in the management of chronic conditions with a specific focus on how initiatives are translated and embedded into the illness management practices in peoples’ everyday life. It is in work, domestic and community  settings where these practices are shaped by the emotional, symbolic, ethical, economic, and institutional inter-dependencies that people have with intimate and distant others, and where personal health is constantly negotiated in relation to one’s own well-being and the health and well-being of others. Framed this way, questions related to self-care practices and changes in health behaviours can be stated as a shift in emphasis to a broader agenda for the provision of healthcare. Such an agenda brings into view ideas dominant in academic and policy debates and discussions of self-management which has drawn attention to the limitations of deploying a ‘one size fits all’ approach and the need to devise and implement workable, personally sensitive strategies for self-management and behaviour change that make full use of available technologies (e.g. eHealth, telehealth, virtual networks), personal, community and institutional resources, and which  more adequately addresses the needs of socially disadvantaged people. Thus, the current focus on individuals (e.g. understanding and improving their knowledge and capabilities) requires a complementary focus on understanding capabilities, resources, and change in health related practices as an integral part of peoples’ social networks and as being co-shaped by wider determinants of health).  There is also a need to focus on the translation of efforts within health services to explore how professionally defined priorities of chronic illness management are translated acted upon and resourced outside of the consultation.",1,0
18,211621,Yes,Delayed Transformational Fatigue in Central and Eastern Europe,"The aim of FATIGUE is to develop theoretically and empirically robust explanations for the causes and consequences of rise of illiberalism and authoritarianism in post-communist Europe (and Europe, more generally) with reference to the concept of 'delayed transformational fatigue'. The project will seek to answer the following questions:  i. Why do illiberal political discourses resonate with people in post-communist Europe?   ii. With which types of people do illiberal discourses particularly resonate?   iii. Under which social, economic and political circumstances are illiberal discourses most likely to gain traction?   iv. How do illiberal political actors make their views of the world hegemonic? Which social, political and economic conditions of possibility enable such hegemonic worldviews to dominate political discourse?   v. Which framing activities are employed by cultural-political entrepreneurs via specific media and educational institutions to make their views of the world hegemonic?   vi. What are the remedies to the current illiberalism? What role does education play in making society aware of the dangers of playing with right-wing ideas.   The research programme will be organised in five work packages, each centred on a research theme pertinent to one or more post-communist EU member-states, accession states or states in the EU’s Eastern Partnership. A sub-team, composed of three partners, will lead the work on each of the five dimensions of the delayed transformational fatigue:   WP1: Illiberal democracy and right-wing politics   WP2: Politics of memory and transitional justice   WP3: Economic populism and inequality   WP4: Cultures of reaction: xenophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-migrant   WP5: Civil society and protest movements",1,1
32,214977,Yes,"Churches, Arks of Migratory Narratives: A Comparative Study of the Greek-Orthodox Religioscapes in Germany and Great Britain","The proposed research project deals with the Greek and Greek-Cypriot migrant communities in Germany and Britain, with reference to the religiocultural evidence found in the public sphere, which illustrate the particularities of their establishment and integration in the receiving country. As regards the Greek Gastarbeiter, they identified their communities with their parishes, as the church often functioned as head of community and a mediator between them and the state. The bulk of the Greek-Cypriot Commonwealth migrants on the other hand, found the Greek-Orthodox Archdiocese already established as well, and as they expanded and dispersed across the British Isles, so did the parishes, which, in both cases, have served as arks of culture and identity. Therefore, one observes the phenomenon of interwoven migrant and church narratives; in the lapse of time, community and church, being closely knit, jointly constructed their migrant narratives of de- and reterritorialisation, cultural adaptation and hybridisation, essentially their own distinct sense of being and belonging. The particularities of this constantly under construction identity are manifest in the hagiographical themes, aesthetics and concepts of their churches, which, albeit within canonical specifications, deviate from the normative typology as it is graphically attested by the occurrences of the phenomenon thereof. It is typical, however, of the Byzantine hagiographic tradition to include and demonstrate the socio-political conditions of its time and place; and, those visual manifestations are part of a sociocultural reality as such, given that they possess a contextual dimension with reference to their symbolic content, their thematic endorsement and the appropriation of extra-ecclesiastical identity elements, but they are also an act and a medium of communication in their own right. It is therefore feasible to decode their aforementioned content and articulate the narrative that they convey.",0,1
53,44637,Yes,Measurement of the labour market effects of disability on household welfare,"Research objectives and content  Disability imposes many costs upon the individual. This project proposes to measure the costs of disability which occur through the operation of the labour market. One of the major innovations of the project is that it examines the effects of disability on the labour market in both a static and dynamic framework. The project has three main parts: first is the estimation of household welfare for the disabled via their labour market characteristics, secondly the measurement of the factors affecting labour market transitions for the disabled and finally the estimation of whether and how much discrimination against the disabled exists in the labour market.  The initial part of the project involves the estimation of participation and labour supply for the disabled. This will enable us to examine how the labour market experience for the disabled differs from that for the fully-abled. From the estimation of participation and labour supply equations, measures of household welfare via the real wage function can be calculated and the welfare loss owing to the different labour market outcomes for the disabled can be evaluated. This analysis may also permit estimation of the welfare effects of various proposed reforms. The second part of the project introduces the dynamic framework in to the analysis. Here we propose to examine transitions between labour market states for the disabled and evaluate what factors are important. This can be performed using the techniques of multiple state transition models and the estimation of the relevant hazard functions to determine whether and how disability affects labour market transitions. For example, it will be possible to estimate how disability affects the probability of becoming unemployed and also how it may affect the probability of returning back to employment from a state of unemployment. This represents a major extension of the work by Thompson and Walker (Disability, Wages and Labour Force Participation: Evidence from UK Panel Data, Keele Economics Working Paper 96/14).  In the final part of the project through examining wage equations for the disabled and using standard decomposition techniques. we can estimate whether and how much labour market discrimination exists against the disabled. The findings from this pan of the project can also feed back into the welfare analysis of the first pan of the project, since differences in wages and labour supply will have obvious welfare effects which can be evaluated using techniques such as real wage functions.  The project would benefit from being associated with a wider comparison between UK, US (using PSID data) and Germany (using GSOEP) to be funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Trust.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The major training content of this project is the use and microeconometric analysis of large micro data sets, in this particular case, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The Economics Dept. at Keele have considerable expertise in this field and the applicant could obviously benefit from such experience. It is expected that a period of training in the use and analysis of such data sets would be of considerable use to the applicant on return to his native country (where such data sets are now becoming generally available for use by research institutions), thus providing further benefits apart from those directly connected with the above project.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  The findings from this project will help firms to formulate policies for their disabled employees and respond to the Disability Act which comes into force on Dec 2, 1996. The Department at Keel has strong links with policy makers and pressure groups in the context of disability.",1,1

This new project targets 4 countries of West Africa and  relies on national PHS. The 'Patient Centred       Approach' for tuberculosis patients is used as a strategy to integrate patient's and health actors' views       in the project. Together with actors working at different levels of health system, each PHS will define      and implement an action research integrating patient and health care provider's perspectives. This action       research will be a cross sector and multi-disciplinary intervention to ensure a systemic approach to health       cares.      Because West African countries usually share same concerns regarding health cares, a regional network       of PHS will be established to exchange information  with capitalisation of the gained experience within the      region .      Finally, evidences generated by the project will be disseminated at national and regional levels to ensure      sustainable development for health system functioning.

911,213784,No,Hypothalamic circuits for the selection of defensive and mating behavior in females,"Social interactions can take different courses depending on the internal state of the participants. For instance, a sexually receptive female mouse will allow a male’s attempt to mount her, but a non-receptive female will fight or flee the same male. Here, we propose to determine how neuronal circuits in the female mouse brain support flexible, state-dependent interactions with male conspecifics. It is known that female receptivity depends on the ventrolateral region of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Within this region there is a population of neurons that expresses receptors for the sex hormone progesterone (PR\ neurons), whose levels cycle with reproductive state. In pilot experiments, we found that PR\ neurons are not homogeneous: some respond during receptive behaviors but others respond during defensive or aggressive behaviors. Our main objective is to determine how female hypothalamic PR\ neurons participate in state-dependent behavioral responses to males. Our hypothesis is that two subpopulations of PR\ neurons are differentially modulated by the reproductive cycle and that each sub-population activates a different downstream circuit, one specialized for receptive and the other for defensive behaviors. Our specific aims are to: (1) characterize the functional selectivity of individual female PR\ neurons across the reproductive cycle; (2) map the connectivity of PR\ neurons to their output targets; (3) test the impact of different PR\ output pathways by genetically activating and silencing them; and (4) determine how reproductive hormones modulate the synaptic and intrinsic functional properties of PR\ neurons. These studies will elucidate the neuronal circuit mechanisms of a biologically essential female behavior. More broadly, this work will reveal mechanisms by which neuronal circuits can support flexible state-dependent adaptive behaviors.",0,0

On 23rd September several activities will be organized in the three historical city centres. Researchers will be performers, guides, animators, always interacting with the public at large. The key focus will be to discover all aspects of life and scientific career of the researchers, showing that they are ordinary people with an amazing job. The events will be different for each location, taking advantage of the diverse characteristics and contexts: a soccer championship, artistic and scientific laboratories, treasure hunts, concerts, discos, guided tours to the cities and to their cultural centres, readings in the cafes, poster exhibitions, activities for children, informal conferences. Six European corners, settled in strategic points of the cities, will host games, videos, music, demonstrations and interactive activities, encouraging the participants to approach the “Research World” and its European dimension.

267,198051,No,Bayesian markets for unverifiable truths,"Subjective data play an increasing role in modern economics. For instance, new welfare measurements are based on people’s subjective assessments of their happiness or their life satisfaction. A problem of such measurements is that people have no incentives to tell the truth. To solve this problem and make those measurements incentive compatible, I will introduce a new market institution, called Bayesian markets. Imagine we ask people whether they are happy with their life. On Bayesian markets, they will trade an asset whose value is the proportion of people answering Yes. Only those answering Yes will have the right to buy the asset and those answering No the right to sell it. Bayesian updating implies that “Yes” agents predict a higher value of the asset than “No” agents do and, consequently, “Yes” agents want to buy it while “No” agents want to sell it. I will show that truth-telling is then the optimal strategy. Bayesian markets reward truth-telling the same way as prediction markets (betting markets) reward people for reporting their true subjective probabilities about observable events. Yet, unlike prediction markets, they do not require events to be objectively observable. Bayesian markets apply to any type of unverifiable truths, from one’s own happiness to beliefs about events that will never be observed. The present research program will first establish the theoretical foundations of Bayesian markets. It will then develop the proper methodology to implement them. Finally, it will disseminate the use of Bayesian markets via applications. The first application will demonstrate how degrees of expertise can be measured and will apply it to risks related to climate change and nuclear power plants. It will contribute to the political debate by shedding new light on what true experts think about these risks. The second application will provide the first incentivized measures of life satisfaction and happiness.",0,0
907,215575,No,Origen'S Exegesis of the Psalms: Contributions from a Close Analysis of his Homilies on the Psalms (Codex Monacensis Graecus 314),"I wish to conduct an in-depth study of Origen’s (d. 254) Homilies on the Psalms, a collection of 29 Greek exegetical homilies on ten biblical psalms. The discovery of this text in 2012 is one of the most important in the history of scholarship on early Christianity, given both Origen’s influence on the subsequent early Christian exegetical tradition and the importance of the Psalms for the early Church. Study of these homilies has only just begun; the critical edition was published in 2015, and the English translation is still underway. I propose a project in three stages in order to make an important contribution to this early phase of research. In the first stage I will conduct a close textual analysis of the homilies. I will analyze Origen's grammatical and rhetorical argumentation, in addition to his philosophical, theological, and moral explanations of the psalms. In stage two I will primarily employ the modern literary theory of tradition history, in order to examine the traditions that influenced Origen in his exegesis of the psalms, such as his use of the exegesis of Philo, Clement, and the New Testament author, Paul. In the third stage I will analyze comparatively Origen's Homilies on the Psalms and his Homilies on Jeremiah, his only other extant Greek homilies prior to the 2012 discovery. This comparison will shed light on the extent to which his treatment of the Psalms is distinctive within his exegetical writings. I am well suited for this task, as I have already worked on early Christian exegetical techniques and with much of Origen’s corpus in my doctoral research. I have already begun preliminary research on the Psalm homilies. The School of Culture and Society at Aarhus University is the ideal place to conduct this study as Anders-Christian Jacobsen, my proposed supervisor, is a world-renown Origen scholar. In addition, many of the school’s researchers are experts in early Christian scriptural interpretation and the methods of tradition history.",0,0
78,74960,Yes,Quality of care and quality of life for people with intellectual and physical disabilities,"The proposed programme of research will investigate the quality of care for people with disabilities in regard to developments in social policy and typical examples of service practice, but will focus also on the subjective experience of individuals with d isabilities within these frameworks. The consortium will establish the range of options available for the care and support of people with physical and intellectual disabilities across the lifespan, within the context of European and other partner countri es. The project will investigate the extent to which these typical care and support options promote integrated living, social inclusion and service user participation; the role of attitudes to disability and persons with disabilities in relation to the delivery of care and service user's experience of social justice; and the impact of different service models and care practices on the quality of life of individuals with disabilities. Three cross cultural measures will be developed within the project and subsequently tested within both European and non-European participating centres: an index of the 'fit' between disability linked needs and available accommodation and care packages (the Accommodation and Care Fit Index - ACFI); a measure of attitudes to d isability and to persons with disability (the Attitudes to Disabilities Scale) with three related versions for direct use with individuals with intellectual and physical disabilities (ADS-D),indirect use with proxy carers (ADS-P), and direct use with mem bers of the general population (ADS-G); and a measure of the quality of life of disabled persons based on the existing World Health Organisation's quality of life measure, the WHOQOL, but adapted and extended for use with disabled persons and their carers (WHOQOL-DIS).

991,222207,No,Coordination in constrained and natural distributed systems,"In recent years, an algorithmic theory of natural and biological systems has been increasingly advocated as providing a much needed framework for investigating complex self-organising processes in nature. This project contributes to this research program by employing the distributed computing lens to model natural phenomena. Biological systems exhibit many properties also studied in distributed computing: they comprise several independently acting entities, tend to operate in noisy and dynamic environments, thus requiring them to be highly-resilient and adaptive, solve intricate coordination tasks, and display sophisticated communication techniques.  This project aims to develop the theory of distributed synchronisation and coordination tasks in restricted models of distributed computing. These tasks are some of the most fundamental problems in distributed computing, as they are essential in computer networks as well as numerous other areas of engineering and computing. In addition, they are ubiquitous in natural and biological systems, ranging from molecular to population-level systems, which are known to solve various synchronisation and coordination tasks: examples include symmetry-breaking during the development of the nervous system, consensus decision making in species communities, and synchronisation in firefly populations and embryonic development.  Unlike computer networks, biological distributed systems have unique features: (1) the agents typically have limited computational abilities, (2) communication is unreliable and restricted, (3) the system has a dynamic spatial structure, and (4) the environment may be noisy. Currently, distributed computing models that consider all aspects simultaneously are lacking. The proposed research approaches this goal from multiple angles by developing new models and analysis methods for determining the limitations of synchronisation and related tasks in both strong and weak models of computing.",0,0

The number of turbulence accidents has been growing by a factor of 5 since 1980. A whole class of turbulence (Clear Air Turbulence), representing 40% of turbulence accidents, cannot be detected by any existing equipment including state-of-the-art weather radar. Operational concepts for the protection against turbulence hazard, based on a UV LIDAR, are: - Short-range measurement of air speed ahead of the aircraft and action on the flight controls, - Medium-range detection of turbulence, and securing of passengers by seat belts fasten. The short-range concept has been validated in the frame of the FP5 AWIATOR project. The objective of DELICAT is to validate the medium range turbulence detection (based on backscattered energy fluctuations). In development phase, both short and medium range will be integrated in single equipment. The validation of medium range turbulence detection is based on the comparison of LIDAR data and aircraft sensors data. - A UV LIDAR mock up is designed, manufactured and flight-tested, - The LIDAR data and the aircraft sensors data are compared off line for the same atmosphere area. The consortium assembled for the DELICAT project includes all the expertise necessary to reach the objective, and will take advantage of previous projects such as FP5 AWIATOR and FP6 FLYSAFE. The project resources are globally adapted to the project ambitious objectives and innovation content. DELICAT takes advantage of existing hardware (laser sub assemblies, test aircraft fairing) to achieve the goal at lower possible cost. The DELICAT project will directly contribute to the objectives of the AAT.2008.3.3.2. topic by increasing customer safety; the objective is to reduce the number of turbulence accidents by 40%.

42,79289,Yes,E-Government for low socio-economic status groups,"Information and communications technology provides governments with new and powerful tools, which enable better and faster communications with the citizens. Recently, many governments are undertaking large and complex endeavours of developing e-Government services. However, the use of e-Government by the citizens is still voluntary. Thus, readiness of citizens to participate in e-Government becomes a crucial factor in the process. Usage of services depends on various factors such as ease of use, proficiency, accessibility and civic engagement. In most countries there are several disadvantaged groups that are less likely to use services.  These groups include elderly people, disabled people, immigrants and low socioeconomic groups (LSG). Since the computer usage by LSG is very low, web-based e-Government services are not available to a relatively large segment of European citizens. The pace at which countries deploy e-Government services, including measures taken to include LSG, vary considerably across Europe. Excluding such populations from e-Government is a major cause of the digital divide within European countries. The main objective of ELOST is to increase readiness to e-Government and civic engagement among LSG. ELOST aims to increase the number of people from this class that will use e-Government services as active citizens. ELOST will perform a multinational study on the policies and plans to introduce e-Government to LSG. Special attention will be given to age and gender aspects.  The objectives are to study the status of e-Government services and tools for LSG in European countries. ELOST will evaluate the attitudes, needs and readiness of LSG by means of questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. A foresight study will analyze the impact of emerging technologies on e-Government services. A cross-cultural analysis will be performed. The findings will lead to policy recommendations for effective and inclusive deployment of e-Government services in Europe.",1,1
709,208505,No,Scientist for neurophysiological research applications in Mobile Brain/Body Imaging,"Brain Products GmbH is operating in the market of neurophysiological research. For this demanding and continuously changing market, we develop and produce complex systems for electroencephalography (EEG). The next step is to enter the innovative and promising field of wearable technologies and Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI). This is an emerging research field, where increasing numbers of laboratories, institutes, universities, and companies take part. Our idea is to enter this research field – which at the same time presents a promising market for us – by connecting research institutes and, as their customers, (big) companies interested in MoBI with our company. Our aim is to develop and deliver new and innovative solutions for wearables and MoBI research. Emerging grants and preliminary market analysis suggest that for Brain Products, the MoBI market currently has a market potential of 1,5 to 2 million Euro with our existing solutions. The development of new products and applications could amplify this market potential significantly. We are applying for an innovation associate, who will be busy in strategic marketing and help us open up the MoBI market and gain market shares. The innovation associate we are looking for is a very specialised person who is not available on the German job market as – until now – there exist only three experienced laboratories in the MoBI field in Germany. However, there is a strong MoBI community in Europe and also worldwide. Due to these reasons we´d like to expand our search for a qualified scientist – and hope that the grant will give us the chance to find such a person who will open up the new „MoBI“ horizon to our company.",0,0
623,225598,No,CORE - Children Online: Research and Evidence. A knowledge base on children and youth in the digital world,"The overall objective of this Coordination and Support Action (CSA) “Children Online: Research and Evidence (CORE)” is to conceptualise, implement and disseminate a comprehensive knowledge base on the impact of technological transformations on children and youth. The CORE knowledge base will provide evidence on a broad range of topics related to the impact of technological transformations on children and youth including their health, lifestyles, participation and digital citizenship, wellbeing, safety, and security as affected by ICT. It will refer to research from all EU Member States and a number of other European countries and thus consider relevant cultural, political, and media-related contexts. This knowledge base will help researchers to identify important research gaps and to make use of existing research and data. At the same time, it will help to contextualise empirical evidence by offering theoretical, methodological, and ethical reflections and guidelines.  The CORE knowledge base will also be an important focal point for policy-makers and educational actors by identifying key issues that deserve special attention, providing access to a solid data base and thus providing an important basis for policy recommendations and (policy) decision-making processes. Various stakeholder groups are actively involved in the development process in order to tailor the platform to their specific needs. All activities of the project aim to develop an innovative, dynamic and sustainable infrastructure with the CORE platform that will last beyond the duration of the CSA.",1,0
27,105415,Yes,Market Selection and Aggregate Economic Outcomes,"Markets play the role of re-distributing resources. Which type of behaviors are rewarded by the exchange? Under which conditions are market capable of rewarding rational better informed agents or profit maximizing firms? Is agents and firms heterogeneity a persistent or transient property? Ultimately, what is the role of market selection in shaping aggregate economic outcomes?  Despite little is known on the issue, most of economic models rely on the Market Selection Hypothesis stating that non maximizing economic actors persistently loose wealth in favors of the maximizing ones. In the long-run the former are driven out of the market so that only the latter have an impact on the economy. However, a formal general proof of the selective capability of markets is still missing.  Aim of this project is to build upon the recent market selection literature, in particular, preliminary results about its possible failure, and recent techniques for the analysis of random dynamical systems in order to provide a definite check of the Market Selection Hypothesis, both in exchange and production economies. Moreover, we shall use the market selection approach to tackle some specific economic questions, such as the effect of financial innovations on financial markets stability, and the ensuing possible misallocations of resources in financing productive activities.  Our research has thus a positive content, namely the characterization of the outcome of market selection under the most general assumptions about agents behavior, and a normative one, namely how to use this knowledge to improve the effect of economic policies.",0,1
509,94373,No,European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions,"The aim of EU-GEI is to identify the interactive genetic, clinical and environmental determinants involved in the development, severity and outcome of schizophrenia (EU-GEI, Schiz. Res. 2008; 102: 21-6). In order to identify these interactive determinants, EU-GEI will employ family-based, multidisciplinary research paradigms, which allow for the efficient assessment of gene-environment interactions. In order to go beyond old findings from historical convenience cohorts with crude measures of environmental factors and clinical outcomes, the focus in EU-GEI will be on recruitment of new, family-based clinical samples with state-of-the-art assessments of environmental, clinical and genetic determinants as well as their underlying neural and behavioural mechanisms. New statistical tools will be developed to combine the latest multilevel epidemiological with the latest genome-wide genetic approaches to analysis. Translation of results to clinical practice will be facilitated by additional experimental research and risk assessment bioinformatics approaches. This will result in the identification of modifiable biological and cognitive mechanisms underlying gene-environment interactions and the construction of Risk Assessment Charts and Momentary Assessment Technology tools which can be used for (i) early prediction of transition to psychotic disorder in help-seeking individuals with an at-risk mental state and (ii) early prediction of course and outcome after illness onset. In order to reach these goals, EU-GEI has assembled a multidisciplinary team of top schizophrenia researchers who have the range of skills required to deliver a program of research that meets all the call’s requirements and who have access to / will collect a number of unique European samples. The partners in EU-GEI represent the nationally funded schizophrenia / mental health networks of the UK, Netherlands, France, Spain, Turkey and Germany as well as other partners.",0,0
477,92702,No,FAST SEMI-ANALYTIC MULTISCALE METHODS FOR MULTISCALE ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS,"The goal of this research is to merge state of the art developments in homogenization theory with multilevel discretization and solution techniques for elliptic equations. Complex multiscale problems are integral part of modeling and numerical simulations in a number of engineering, environmental and biomedical sciences. These problems have physical phenomena in hierarchical structures with multiple, poorly separated length scales. This can result in very large discretizations, which often require advanced supercomputing equipment. Today’s supercomputers, however, allow a limited number of high fidelity simulations. We propose to develop fast semi-analytic methods for multiscale simulations of elliptic systems, when the media has poor scale separation. The key idea is to incorporate analytical approximation of fine-scale local solutions into multilevel methods. These solutions, currently developed for scalar elliptic equation, have been used to approximate both the cell solution of classical homogenization as well as to compute upscaled tensor coefficients. By incorporating those in multilevel iterations on can achieve considerable computational savings compared to state of the art numerical multiscale techniques. The approximations to the fine-scale cell solution will allow to implement both efficient and accurate prolongation operators from coarse to fine levels, as well as coarsening strategies involving the analytical effective tensor coefficient. The procedure will then be extended to the elasticity operator, targeting biomedical applications, such as simulations of bone tissue, relevant to osteoporosis disease. Similar procedure can be also applied for field scale environmental problems, such as carbon sequestration. The expected transfer of knowledge in the area of multiscale methods will add to the host’s current efforts in biomedical modeling and simulations. The proposed research also coincides with long-term goals of the host institution, IPP-BAS.",0,0
25,82520,Yes,Transnational care practices of Brazilian Working Class Migrants living in Australia and Portugal: a comparative perspective,"The aim of this research is to explore and compare the impact of distance on the experiences of Brazilian working class migrants living in Australia and in Portugal who care for ageing, disabled parents in their home countries. Drawing on the results of an ethnographic study of six groups of professional migrants living in Australia, conducted by Baldassar, Baldock and Witling, the research will address the questions of Brazilian migrants, motivation and capacity (ability, opportunity) to contribute to practical, emotional and personal care of their elderly parents back home, and of the structural constraints that shape the forms of this type of care-giving. By focussing on working class migrants, transnational care practices in two different countries, this research will try to shed light on the one hand on the influence that weaker levels of social, economic and cultural capital can have on the capacity and ability to provide transnational care, and on the other hand on the influence of migration and employment policies on this capacity and ability. The objectives are to develop the applicant's scientific and empirical knowledge on transnational care, family dynamics, gender dynamics and care practices; to enhance the applicant's skills of independent thinking and criticism by testing and challenging the existing theories in the field through a focus on working class migrants in two different national contexts; and to be trained to multi-sited ethnographic methods of investigation. These objectives will be achieved through the applicant's integration to the team that developed the notion of transnational care, in a dynamic process of ongoing discussion and debate; and through the transfer and application of the new knowledge and skills acquired by conducting a comparative field study in Portugal with the support of the return host institution. This project will be the first step towards the development of research on transnational care at the EU level.",1,1

They will be oriented to robotic service app lications, and especially for helping people with motor disabilities. The scien tific objectives of the project are: - Transfer of fundamental biological princ iples from cognitive-motor behaviour to antropomorphic robotics. - Construction of a high level, hardware independent, adaptive and modular library of element ary hand gestures. - New neural schemes that mimic the known cooperation betwee n cerebral cortex and cerebellum/basal ganglia during cognitive motor behaviour in manipulation. - Specifications for a subsequent industrial research project to be carried out by the endorsers The technical objectives of the project ar e: - Biological neural networks capable of construct grasp plans in the face of both functional and objectspecific constraints. - A language of opposition spa ce and virtual finger, oriented to construct a sequence learning of self adapti ve elementary hand gestures with total independence of application and environm ent. - Adaptive neural controllers wich, tested within laboratory environment u sing computer simulation, will be capable of generalising their skills in the s caling-up process to different robotics hands. The present project will transfe r human planning processes to robotics, while incorporating experimental result s from behavioural, anatomical, and neurophysiological studies. A well-defined robust set of mathematical models, elementary library of gestures, behavioural modules, and a selection mechanism over them will produce a considerable improv ement in the building of flexible and robust control systems for robot hands. M oreover, it will imply a reduction of the time and efforts necessary in the sca ling-up from laboratory to service robotics and a reduction of danger where rob ots must interact with humans. The generic neural models for human-like, flexib le, adaptive manipulation are not limited to the robotic service industry. The results of the present project are applicable in the whole area of manufacturin g where compliance is desirable to interact with the changing environment.",0,0
910,27157,No,Tree-ring evidence of climate change in northern eurasia during the last 2000 years,"To describe the natural variability of climate, both temperature and precipitation (or precipitation-related) variables, over various parts of northern Eurasia for periods up to 2000 years before present.   The emphasis will be on relatively high-resolution (annual or seasonal) analyses. Instrumental records will be examined but the principal focus is the collection and exploration of tree-ring-related evidence to reconstruct local, regional-mean and large-scale patterns of climate change and to explore statistical links with various potential forcings such as solar variability, volcanism and other internally-driven processes such as the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.  The overall project will bring together evidence from three major sub-projects, each with a particular emphasis on a different tree-ring variable.  A 'northern' project will assemble and analyze a network of mainly densitometric chronologies in northern Fennoscandia and Siberia. Through the development of statistical multivate transfer functions, these largely temperature sensitive data will yield reconstructions of spatial patterns of temperature variability for periods ranging from hundreds to thousands of years across a wide longitudinal range.  A 'central' project will assemble and reprocess existing ring-width data, mainly on oak (of living, historical and sub-fossil origin) principally from sites in Great Britain, Denmark, Germany and Poland. These data will be used to document changes in the natural variability of temperature and moisture conditions during the last two millennia.  The third sub-project will undertake a preliminary systematic investigation of the potential for interpreting stable isotope composition (carbon and oxygen) in wood cellulose from individual tree rings. Isotopic measurements will be made on replicate oak trees at each of two contrasting sites from three west European regions. This sub-project will be constrained by the length of available climate records against which these data must be compared and will concentrate on the last 100 years.",0,0
583,221389,No,Standard Operating Procedures for Research Integrity,"The objective of the Standard Operating Procedures for Research Integrity (SOPs4RI) project is to promote excellent research that aligns with the principles and norms of the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, and to counter research misconduct. SOPs4RI will stimulate transformational processes across European research performing organisations (RPOs) and research funding organisations (RFOs) to achieve  this goal. SOPs4RI involves a mixed-methods, co-creative approach to the development and empirical validation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and guidelines to cultivate research integrity and reduce detrimental practices.  With rigorous methods, the SOPs and guidelines will be developed by experts and key stakeholders and will be offered as flexible tools for RPOs and RFOs to develop Research Integrity Promotion Plans. Active researchers in the EU and selected OECD countries will be surveyed as part of the validation procedure. Proposals for appropriate incentives and novel sanctions will be developed to promote adoption. The discipline-sensitive SOPs and guidelines will support the production of sound, trust-worthy knowledge, a precondition for tackling the current crisis of truth and trust in science. In turn, a strong research integrity culture and high epistemic quality of research-based knowledge will make a vital contribution to addressing the EU’s current and future challenges. SOPs4RI is fully aligned with the core objectives of the Science with and for Society 2018-20 Work Programme and will draw upon and liaise with other projects in the work programme. To maximise the feasibility and impact of the project’s outcomes, SOPs4RI engages with key stakeholders in the ERA and beyond in an iterative development, cost benefit assessment, and real world validation of the toolbox of SOPs and guidelines. A strategic communication plan leveraging the support of key partners will be implemented to maximise short, medium, and longer term impacts.",0,0
942,108265,No,Parallelism and Beyond: Dynamic Parallel Computation for Efficiency and High Performance,"We propose to radically extend the frontiers of two major themes in computing, parallelism and dynamism, and develop a novel paradigm of computing:  dynamic-parallelism.  To this end, we will follow two lines of research.  First, we will develop techniques for extracting efficiency and high performance from parallel programs written in high-level programming languages.  Second, we will develop the dynamic-parallelism model, where computations can respond to a wide variety of dynamic changes to their data automatically and efficiently, by developing novel abstractions (calculi), high-level programming-language constructs, and compilation techniques.  The research will culminate in a language that extends the C programming language with support for parallel and dynamic-parallel programming.  The proposal is motivated by urgent needs driven by the advent of multicore chips, which is making parallelism mainstream, and the increasing ubiquity of software, which requires applications to operate on highly dynamic data.  These advances demand parallel and highly dynamic software, which remains too difficult and labor intensive to develop.  The urgency is further underlined by the increasing data and problem sizes---online data grows exponentially, doubling every few years---that require similarly powerful advances in performance.  The proposal will achieve profound impact by dramatically simplifying the development of high-performing dynamic and dynamic-parallel software.  As a result, programmer productivity and software quality including correctness, reliability, performance, and resource (e.g., time and energy) consumption will improve significantly.  The proposal will not only open new research opportunities in parallel computing, programming languages, and compilers, but also in other fields where parallel and dynamic problems abound, e.g., algorithms, computational biology, geometry, graphics, machine learning, and software systems.",0,0
502,101028,No,New Deals in the New Economy,"How are European workplaces being transformed? What kinds of new social bargains are emerging across the European Union? How are they being institutionalised? How are new workplace bargains shaped by the broader politics of sectors, regions and national economies?  These questions are crucial to the future of the European ‘social model’.  The objective of this research programme is to provide answers to these questions, drawing on cross-national survey research on workplace organisation from 1995 to 2010 and selected industrial case studies in the small open European economies of Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands.  These questions also raise crucial theoretical issues. The research reformulates the core elements of the ‘Varieties of Capitalism’ framework that has dominated comparative political economy for the past decade (Hall and Soskice, 2001). It improves our understanding of the diverse organisation of capitalism in Europe, of how that diversity is rooted in politically constructed ‘pathways to the future’, and of how capitalism is constructed out of social and institutional capabilities across Europe.",1,0
236,90065,No,Forecasting Societies  Adaptive Capacities to Climate Change,"This interdisciplinary project (combining social and earth sciences) addresses a key gap in the knowledge of global assessments concerning the likely consequences of future climate change on future human wellbeing. More information about the determinants of future adaptive capacity is necessary for setting policy priorities today: Should the significant funds allocated for adaptation be invested in enhancing existing infrastructure or currently practiced agricultural strategies (some of which may not be tenable under future climates), or should they invest alternatively in enhancing human empowerment through education and health which in consequence will enable affected societies to better cope with whatever challenges the future will bring?  This study is expected to bring significant progress in this difficult multidisciplinary, yet highly relevant, field through a combination of: (a) New global science-based, long-term projections of human capital (population by age, sex and level of education) as a key element of adaptive capacity; (b) Three empirical multi-national studies on key factors involved in past vulnerability and adaptations to the Sahelian drought, Hurricane Mitch and the Asian tsunami; (c) Three prospective case studies assessing future adaptive capacity for the Phuket region, Mauritius and the Nicobar islands; (d) All held together and put into perspective by the elaboration of a new demographic theory of long-term social change with predictive power.  This rather complex project structure is necessary for reaching generalizable and useful results. All components have been designed to complement each other to maximize the chances of achieving path-breaking and at the same time tangible results in this highly complex, multidisciplinary field. All components of the study will build on previous work of IIASA and Wolfgang Lutz and hence minimize the need to acquire additional experience for the case study sites or for the methodology used.",0,0
755,103028,No,Novel Molecular Mechanisms of Neuron Migration in the Developing Cortex and their Contribution to Related Diseases,"Understanding the molecular principles of nervous system connectivity is the biggest challenge in biomedical research for the XXIst century. Nervous system connectivity is regulated by two fundamental processes: cell migration and axon guidance. The cerebral cortex is the region of the brain that has undergone the biggest expansion in primates and is the responsible of our cognitive abilities. The mature cortex is formed by excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons that arrive to the cortex by two different migratory pathways: radial migration and tangential migration, respectively. The so-called basal progenitor (BP) cells are especial pyramidal cell progenitors that increase the number of differentiated neurons and play a key function in increasing cortex size during primate evolution. In humans, mutations that affect neuron migration result in severe mental diseases. The characterization of these mutations has revealed many genes involved in cytoskeleton dynamics. Surprisingly, little is known about the extracellular factors that control neuron migration. Fibronectin and Leucine-Rich Transmembrane proteins (FLRT1-3) are expressed in the developing cortex and ventral telencephalon. My previous data revealed that FLRT2 and the axon guidance receptor Unc5D play a role in regulating the migration of the BP cells in the developing cortex of the mouse. In the present proposal I will use FLRTs as molecular entry points to analyze basic aspects of neuronal migration in the developing brain. I will address the exact mechanisms by which FLRT2 regulates the behaviour of the migrating BP cells and the contribution of FLRTs to the tangential migration of interneurons. I will also study the expression of FLRTs in human samples in order to extrapolate our observations to human cortex development and disease. The present proposal will provide novel molecular insights on neuron migration with a direct impact on human brain development, evolution and disease.",0,0
317,78634,No,Promotion of the European Radiobiological Archives ERA,"Molecular and genetic research is now providing us with the opportunity to quantify the risks of radiation exposure at the individual level. The retrospective analysis of earlier epidemiological and animal studies will be an important resource for modelling and evaluating such new risk parameters. With great foresight the EU and EULEP have created a database collecting and collating data from almost all of the available animal radiation biology studies carried out in Europe, the US and Japan between 1960 and 1998, plus those of two human cohort studies. This database is called the European Radiobiology Archives (ERA). Funding for the long-term maintenance of ERA is assured from other sources. This proposal for specific support is designed only to maximise the exploitation of the resource, making ERA accessible to the greatest number of end-users. This will be done by making the archive accessible on line (e.ERA), while assuring controlled user access. The dissemination of e.ERA will then be promoted by presentations at major scientific conferences and by two training workshops. In addition, e.ERA will be made compatible to and interoperable with other relevant radiobiological databases, namely JRA, NRA, PATHBASE, and other mouse phenotype projects. One major aim is to establish recoding of the pathology data in ERA to conform with accepted ontology standards (MPATH) for the mouse. Finally the possibility of expanding the database to include data from other projects and to establish a tissue data bank will be examined; the actual modification of the database to do this would not however form part of this proposal. We will deliver a unique on-line repository of archival data, the project will put into effect an easy to use database of invaluable data for further exploitation by the scientific community. The work will be finished within the project's duration, and the contractors will then undertake to sustain this research tool from their own Institutional resources.",0,0
134,94137,Yes,Growing Inequalities' Impacts,"The project focus are inequalities in income/wealth and education and their social/political/cultural impacts. It combines an interdisciplinary approach, improved methodologies, wide country coverage, a clear policy dimension and broad dissemination. It exploits differences between and within countries in inequality levels and trends to understand impacts and tease out implications for policy and institutions. It highlights potential effects of individual distributional positions and increasing inequality for a host of ‘bad outcomes’ (societal and individual) and allows feedback from impacts to inequality in a frame of policy-oriented debate and comparison across 25 EU countries, USA, Japan, Canada and Australia. Social impacts include educational access and achievement, individual employment opportunities and labour market behaviour, household joblessness, living standards and deprivation, family and household formation/breakdown, housing and intergenerational social mobility, individual health and life expectancy, and social cohesion versus polarisation. Underlying long-term trends, the economic cycle and the current financial and economic crisis will be incorporated. Politico-cultural impacts investigated are: Do increasing income/educational inequalities widen cultural and political ‘distances’, alienating people from politics, globalisation and European integration? Do they affect individuals’ participation and general social trust? Is acceptance of inequality and policies of redistribution affected by inequality itself? What effects have political systems (coalitions/winner-takes-all)? Finally, it focuses on costs and benefits of limiting income inequality and its efficiency for mitigating other inequalities (health, housing, education and opportunity). A detailed flexible plan and support from an outstanding Advisory Board will allow the highly experienced research team to deliver important new answers to questions of great import to European societies.",1,1
105,79229,Yes,The insecure perspectives of the low skilled in the knowledge society,"The European Low-wage Employment Research network LoWER, started 1996 under FP4, proposes to continue its activities focusing on the uncertain position of the low skilled in societies increasingly functioning on the basis of formal knowledge, particularly for allocating jobs - and thus income and social and self-esteem. The network provides important links to new research including that of many European projects. It will consolidate its membership, broaden its base in the candidate countries and shift its f ocus. The study of changes occurring in the functioning of present-day labour markets and work organisations regarding skill contributes importantly to the understanding of developments towards and potential effects of a knowledge-based society. In the low -skilled and low-paid labour market the structures of time (part-time jobs), skill (overeducation and lacking training) and households (worklessness, inheritance) are evolving rapidly, with strong interactions, to the disadvantage of low-skilled persons an d social cohesion. The network will stimulate the study of these trends bringing together in the perspective of the low skilled (workshops, open-call conferences, expert groups, exchange of personnel) scholars who have built a tradition of research co-oper ation stretching well beyond the network. The work is organised in packages addressing 1) individual mobility & employer behaviour, 2) household behaviour & intergenerational transmission, 3) gender & skills and 4) skills & training - each contributing to the study of the above trends. Interestingly, levels, processes and trends differ significantly across countries (e.g. declining part-time employment in some countries) and much can be learned from international comparisons, including the U SA. They will also be considered from different angles, micro meso and macro, and explicitly address the demand side. The activities go beyond pure analysis to enable #",1,1
7,188668,Yes,Gender citizenship and sexual rights in Europe: transgender lives from a transnational perspective,"'The TRANSRIGHTS project investigates transgender lives and the institutional apparatus that frames them. Rather than focusing exclusively on self displayed identities, four lines of inquiry will be developed. Firstly, gender politics and sexual rights are analyzed as the opposition between politics of equality and of difference is unable to provide answers for the inclusion of trans-people. Secondly, by comparing the lives of trans-people in five European countries – Portugal, France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden – we wish to attain an overview of how institutional frameworks impact on these lives. Thirdly, our approach will take into account the immigration of trans-individuals to Europe, whether in search for recognition or as a way of survival often leading to sex work. Fourthly, by comparing different countries, different groups of transgender people, different forms of attaining inclusion or dealing with exclusion, different conceptions of gender citizenship and sexual rights, we wish not only to gain a deeper understanding of societal change and its impact on the lives of transgender individuals, but also to identify the gaps between policies and rights and the categories actually mobilized for self-identification. Such a task implies examining the voices of trans-people, the effect of policies on the materiality of lives as well as conceptualizations of selfhood that do not necessarily confine to the European context. Project outputs will contribute to the fields of gender, sexuality and citizenship by providing a grounded theoretical debate, discussing the gender categories of citizenship. Trans-people are a heterogeneous group that represents one of the most challenging boundaries for framing this debate within and beyond Europe. The voices of trans-people are essential to avoid an excessive reduction of lives to institutional categories, whether from the institutional apparatus, the LGBT movements or the social sciences.'",1,1
