730,226456,No,Magnet4Europe: Improving Mental Health and Wellbeing in the Health Care Workplace,"Over 23 million Europeans work in health care. Burnout, anxiety, sleep disorders, depression, and associated stigma are more common among health care workers, and exact a huge toll on individuals and families, particularly on women who are the majority of health care workers, and on society by erosion of productivity and safety of health services. Magnet4Europe transfers, modifies, scales up, and evaluates an evidence-based model of organizational redesign of clinical work environments to enhance workers’ wellbeing, retention, productivity, and patient outcomes. The Magnet model of workplace redesign has been adopted by 490 hospitals in 6 countries but has been slow to take root in Europe despite substantial interest as evidenced by letters from 84 European hospitals in 5 countries (Belgium, England, Germany, Ireland, Sweden) to participate in Magnet4Europe. Proof of concept of transferability of Magnet to differently organized and financed health care systems was shown in 2 pilots. Magnet4Europe modifies the Magnet model with stakeholder co-designed adaptations for Europe, one-to-one twinning with Magnet recognized hospitals, a learning collaborative including policymakers to promote success and sustainability, and a critical mass of institutions promoting innovation, attracting public interest, and fostering replication. Magnet4Europe uses a mixed method design to determine direct and indirect individual and collective health outcomes and cost effectiveness; it will improve mental health, reduce sickness absence, positively impact productivity and economic results by redesigned clinical work environments that promote mental health. The project will inform workplace mental health policies based on evidence with applicability beyond health care. Coordination is by experienced partners that implemented the FP7-RN4CAST project in 12 EU countries producing 70\ scientific papers, influencing EU and national policies to improve nurse retention and patient outcomes.",1,0
453,210674,No,"A novel and easy to interpret patient safety monitor, for the diagnosis and management of cardiac function, fluid delivery and drug administration during surgery and intensive care.","Worldwide 234 million patients undergo major surgery annually. One million will die within 30 days. A further 42 million simply die up to 13 years sooner due to complications and 12 million will enter intensive care in the EU and US. This unacceptable situation has the potential to increase Deltex’s revenues 5 fold by 2020 through the development of TruVue. Of the adverse events 51% are directly due to inadequate haemodynamic management. Hemodynamic instability and low blood pressure are frequent, with consequences such as myocardial infarctions, stroke and kidney injury. Complications have serious clinical and financial consequences; unplanned intensive care admissions; longer stay; increased readmissions; increased 30 day mortality; and shorter patient lifespan after discharge. Healthcare faces increasingly complex cases as the population ages and uses ever more complex equipment. Protecting patients from haemodynamic errors through improved monitoring should save thousands of lives, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Diagnostic haemodynamic equipment needs to display the interaction of flow and pressure if it is to be truly effective. Current monitors are failing to meet this need. Deltex and Lariboisiere Hospital Paris have developed the novel TruVue Velocity Pressure Loops system. TruVue provides simultaneous visual display of the patient’s aortic blood flow velocity and aortic blood pressure; and will be a significant contribution to patient safety. TruVue has been CE-marked and is in use at Lariboisiere Hospital. This phase 1 project has two aims: to obtain user input to enhance the Graphical User Interface (GUI); and to cost a multinational multicentre clinical trial for phase 2 application. Deltex envisages that the clinical trial will generate publications, ‘seed’ leading centres and promote the TruVue within the EU and globally. A full assessment of the sales opportunity and return on investment will be presented as part of a fully-costed business plan.",0,0
701,215536,No,Payoff-Based Decision-Making,"This project investigates the effects of personal payoff experiences on subsequent decisions in repeated settings under uncertainty with feedback. The project will first build a theoretical framework integrating the effects of experienced payoffs on both risk attitudes and beliefs. In the model, payoffs influence risk preferences, relaxing the assumption that preferences are stable; payoffs also distort information processing, causing belief biases. I will model this as an individual investor’s portfolio choice problem, and generate implications for behavior and for asset price dynamics. The theoretical results will be tested experimentally and empirically. I will use one experiment to establish the validity of theoretical predictions in a controlled setting where payoff experiences vary across treatments, with all other things equal. The other experiment complements the first by disentangling the competing preference and belief mechanisms with the help of brain scanning technology. Finally, the external validity will be checked in an empirical study using individual investors’ trading and pension choices data. The data contain survey results of investors’ beliefs towards own investments and the market, providing a natural ground for a test of my theory. Understanding of the payoff-based decision-making mechanism in finance can potentially shed light on other behavioral patterns in financial decision-making, such as herding and style investing. This project will thus generate important policy implications for individual investors to improve their welfare, for financial firms to make profits, and for policy makers to enhance market efficiency.",0,0
177,188570,Yes,Harmonized framework allowing a sustainable and robust identity for European Citizens,"The increase of the identity theft phenomenon across Europe and its related human and economical impacts is a major concern for all M.S. Several EU initiatives are ongoing to try to curb this concern. Today’s identity can take various forms, either in the “real” world, as a primary identity delivered by a M.S. (passport, ID card, driving license...) but more and more in the “2.0” world (secondary identity for banking, administration, professional and commercial activities...). Similarly identity theft can take various forms, from stealing citizens' paper documents, or simply by using digital means. Privacy is at the center of all concerns, as any solution must protect citizen’s identity and privacy, whilst not being worse than the problem itself. The major objective of EKSISTENZ is to protect EU citizens’ identities from all current threats but also to foresee what the future threats would be. The project will study in deep the identity theft phenomenon in Europe, revealing the flaws in the different “paper-based” procedures but also in the new dematerialized processes, assess the threat for the citizen and consequently, will develop technological components, backward compatible with different existing M.S. frameworks. EKSISTENZ will also focus on an “identity-as-a-service” approach, to allow M.S. interoperability, leading to a more global system to provide secure and strong identity for all M.S. To achieve this, the consortium will bring together different types of users involved in the identity chain (authorities, industrials, stakeholders, businesses), specialized technology providers and of course, data protection and privacy experts. EKSISTENZ will recommend updates to EU regulations in order to clearly inform, protect, propose responses and increase its resilience following an attempt. Knowing this, identity theft will become, if not impossible, much harder to carry out.",1,1

It explores the effects of European integration on territorially concentrated ethnic minorities and their politics, as well as on their relations with nationa l majorities and the state. We have selected nine cases of minority inhabited regions, five in ED member states and four in accession countries of Central-East and Southeast Europe (CESE). We will examine how changing opportunities and constraints induced by ED regional economi' and human rights policies, alter patterns of local political participation and economic activity of local ethnic minorities and national majorities, their relations with national and ethnic political parties and state administratie as well as minority political and cultural demands vis-a-vis the central state. We will also examine their influence on how local minorities and majorities view their identification with a national or ethnic community, their rights and obligations as citiz ens of a state, as well as how they conceptualise 'Europe.' More specifically, we will foci on ethnic minorities inhabiting regions near or across border areas in EU member states and accession countries, looking at EU cohesion policy (structural funds and cross border co-operation initiatives), pre-accession programs that include funds to prepare CESE states to implement structural funds and the broader regime of human rights and minority protection, which has developed over the past fifteen years in conj unction with the Council of Europe (CoE).

1019,31529,No,CEMS business best practice network,"The overall objective of the project CEBUSNET is to strengthen the competitiveness of European enterprises by collecting, describing, verifying, consolidating, adjusting, and disseminating Business Best Practice (BBP). The main thesis is that European enterprises can enhance their abilities to compete effectively world-wide by applying BBP.  The project has two main objectives: (1) Development of a framework for BBP consolidation (2) Development of a dissemination approach and building-up a network, by which consolidated BBPs can be disseminated.  In order to disseminate BBP to a large number of interested groups, three goals have to be achieved: - Activation of the CEMS-BBP Network - Design and Implementation of Dissemination Products and Procedures - Building-up of TBP-Support-Centres.  Important are the following subgoals, which can be derived from the project objectives: - The project will use new interactive ways for BBP-dissemination. The intention is to trigger organisational learning processes in the participating enterprises. - The project will apply a pragmatic understanding of 'what is BBP?' Besides this pragmatic approach a consolidation approach will be developed. - The project will apply special measures to collect and consolidated BBP. In the centre of thinking is the concept 'verification workshop', which makes it possible to perform highly interactive sessions with BBP-suppliers and future BBP-users. Business success factors of the participating partners and countries will be intensively considered. - After having analysed BBP-Cases in all partner countries and consolidated them by using the BBP framework, a process of BBP-synthesis will be performed. In this process 'best practice results' and 'ways, how to achieve best practice' are in the centre of thinking. - The project will have a 'life after the termination of the contract'. Most of the participating CEMS-schools will stimulate the foundation of TBP support centres. Besides that there is a high probability that young companies founded by absolvents of the schools will 'spring-off' and take the role as commercial TBP support centres, using the contacts, which these absolvents got during their studies participating actively in the BBP-consolidation and dissemination processes. - The project is based on the totally voluntary gathering of six European business schools, which are already collaborating intensively since six years. The consortium partners are convinced that the idea of CEBUSNET is highly attractive for all CEMS-schools (12 in total) and beyond that for a large number of not only business schools but also other institutions engaged in the fields of education, training, and research in management.",0,0

927,61514,No,Flexible Agency for collective demand-responsive Mobility Services,"By capitalising on results, experience and practices gained in previous RTD projects, FAMS will implement and trial the concept of a Flexible Agency for collective, demand-responsive mobility services, evaluate the viability and impacts in real business cases and gather knowledge and best practice to ensure dissemination and subsequent adoption at the European level. FAMS trials will be conducted in two European sites, the Tuscany Region (IT) and the Angus Region (UK) with complementary characteristics and transport environments.  Objectives: The objective of the FAMS Trial Project is to scale up the technology, service and business models currently adopted in Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) and support the evolution from single DRT applications to the concept of a Flexible Agency for Collective (e.g. public) Demand Responsive Mobility Services. On the one hand, the Agency will co-ordinate the operation of different transit operators / organisations involved in the provision of DRT service; on the other hand, it will improve the overall accessibility to mobility services for the citizens, user groups and associations. State-of-the-art DRT technology e.g. booking and reservation systems, route and service planning systems, communication services, service management services, service and customer repositories - will be further extended and adapted to work within an innovative e-Business infrastructure.  Based on standard internet and web technologies, this will provide: 1) end-users of intermediate transport services (DRT) with advanced, diffused and flexible interfaces for improved booking and service information access, and; 2) DRT operators with a number of internet-based services for the sharing and co-ordinated management of transport resources (vehicles). This will ultimately allow different transport operators to co-operate each other and the overall transport system to work as a virtual, flexible organisation.   Work description: The work planned in FAMS includes the following elements: - adaptation and scale-up of: 1) previously demonstrated DRT technologies and methods and; 2) e-Business/e-Work collaboration and team-working tools and methods, to support operation and co-ordination of a set of Demand Responsive services by a Flexible Mobility Agency; - deployment of the Flexible Agency concept in two EU sites and transfer to these of the technological, operational and organisational experience gained about application of ITS in DRT; - implementation of trials in the sites, including trial and test of the impacts of GPRS technology in supporting DRT operations within the Flexible Agency; - comparative assessment of technologies, organisational models and implementation contexts, based on a common Measurements and Evaluation Plan; - assistance to the Users and Suppliers in decision-making, as regards further deployment and use of trialled IT solutions and product consolidation and market penetration strategies, respectively - collection of knowledge and best practice on Flexible Agency implementation and operation and dissemination of these through a 'Handbook and Best Practice Guide'; - market stimulation for IT and e-Business/e-Work products supporting in effective implementation of DRT and the Flexible Agency.  Milestones: Three Collective Transport Operators/Authorities - ATAF (IT), SITA (IT) and Angus Transport Forum (UK) - will implement and trial the Flexible Agency. Two IT suppliers, Mobisoft Oy (FI) and Softeco Sismat (IT) will provide the required technology transfer by adapting solutions obtained in previous RTD projects, ATAF (IT), will also provide transfer of expertise on DRT operation and will support in implementing best practice in community transport and DRT at end-user organisations.

815,108458,Yes,All Rights Reserved? Barriers towards EUropean CITIZENship,"The European Court of Justice expects European citizenship to become the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States. It ‘lies at the heart of the European integration process’. The treaties, legislation, and case law have given Europeans an increasing number of rights. Yet the European Commission complains that these remain underused. Therefore, it has included in FP7 a call for a large-scale IP, identifying and analyzing ‘barriers’ to exercising such European citizenship rights. Utrecht University is initiating a response to this call. In its project proposal it identifies research questions and several categories of potential hindrances as answers to some of them: contradictions between different rights, ‘multilevel’ rights, and differences in priorities Member States accord these rights; differences in political, administrative, and legal institutions; financial restraints; lack of sufficient solidarity; administrative and bureaucratic hurdles; language problems; and other practical barriers to claiming and exercising rights - and related duties. Furthermore we distinguish citizenship rights by the types of rights - economic, social, political, and civil - and by the ascribed characteristics of the subjects of these rights: male and female, young and old, native and immigrant. We believe multidisciplinarity will help in identifying and analyzing barriers to the exercise of European citizenship. We can learn from other times and places; therefore we add a historical and comparative dimension to the analysis. And we aim to combine insights from the historical, legal, and social sciences. Overall we want to investigate the options for a multilayered citizenship true to the EU's motto 'In Varietate Concordia'. The research questions and theoretically identified barriers will be investigated in 12 different work packages, each containing specific research objectives, tasks, roles of the participants, and deliverables",1,1

22,220577,Yes,Societal transformation to sustainability through the unmaking of capitalism? A comparative study of radical grassroots innovations in Europe,"Modern capitalist societies engage destructively with the natural environment. Societal transformation to sustainability is urged, but it implies a degree of disruption of modern, capitalist ways of being and doing. Radical grassroots innovations – those that posit a profound cultural, economic, and political transformation of dominant institutions and practices - hold the potential to lead such transformation, but may be constrained by their marginal, local, small-scale character.  This programme aims to understand to what extent, under what conditions, and through what processes radical grassroots innovations unmake modern, capitalist institutions and practices. This research will compare Italian and German radical grassroots innovations in agriculture to: (1) identify and categorize mechanisms of unmaking that are involved in radical grassroots innovations; (2) explain whether and how unmaking creates space for alternatives from the individual to the social-ecological level; (3) understand how mechanisms of unmaking at different levels interplay; (4) explain why unmaking may result in different outcomes in different context; (5) develop a theory of unmaking in societal transformation to sustainability.This research is ground breaking as it (1) approaches societal transformation from the perspective of unmaking of dominant institutions, rather than of the introduction of innovations, (2) mobilizes theories that have so far not been considered, and innovatively integrates theories and levels of analysis, (3) originally employs mixed methods that capture trajectories of change, and enable to generalize causal mechanisms in complex social-ecological systems. This programme will push the boundaries of our understanding of transformation to sustainability. It will generate scientific knowledge that will be relevant across the social sciences, offer a theoretical lens –unmaking-, and test a process-tracing methodological approach to stimulate interdisciplinary research.",1,1

This, in the XXI century  is not only an inefficient and cruel process but also, it creates a huge environmental impact, which could be avoidable. Unfortunately, brands and shoes manufacturers have no ecological alternative to natural leather that can reproduce successfully its key characteristics from the consumer point of view.  Existing alternatives in the market, mainly PVC bases synthetic leather, do not only show poorer performance from client perspective but also they still create a huge environment impact. Potential clients across the world (Inditex and Louis Vuitton in Europe; Puma, Adidas and Nike in USA) do confirm there is a clear trend towards the development of safer, toxic-free, sustainable, environmental-friendly and more ethical footwear and leather goods. Furthermore they confirm the need of new materials to increase their productivity and profitability while reducing the use of hazardous chemicals in tanning practices. Considering the size of the leather market (estimated around 100bn$ by 2019, CAGR 3,4%) and these comments from clients, we see very high potential in upscaling to industrial level the results we obtained so far with BacLEATHER, a leather-like biomaterial. This material is produced by bacterial fermentation through a proprietary technology and  mimics leather characteristics. Patent Shoes, S.L. has already been able to produce the material in short series and we have already established a collaboration with TEMPE, from GRUPO INDITEX (one of the most important brand footwear companies, owner of ZARA brand, among others) in order to prepare the material for its market-fit within the footwear vertical. We see in the BacLEATHER project a clear investment opportunity, in which we seek entering the fast growing leather-like market and achieve a five-year cumulative cash flow of €16,75 M€, meaning a 5-years ROI of 610%.",0,0
654,110838,No,Reflective Game Design,"Reflective game design concerns games that are designed to trigger critical reflection in their players, particularly in light of what game actions may mean in a larger socio-cultural context. Critical reflection, in this context, refers to consideration of our values, practices, actions, and awareness of agency in relation to socio-cultural, gender, religious, and economic forces as a means for change, action, and empowerment. Reflective game design can be used for any domain in which reflection may serve as an effective mode of learning or persuasion, for example, to promote safer behaviours related to use of digital media, to prompt community conversation about the integration of refugees, to temper racial conflicts, to promote green behaviours, to change women’s attitudes towards getting regular cervical smear tests, etc.  While there is a growing body of research related to reflective design, critical design, and serious game design, none of these existing research areas focus on the specific intersection of games and reflection. REFLECT is intended to address this gap in research knowledge and design practice, especially as games seem particularly well-suited as a medium for inducing reflection.  Goals of the REFLECT project are to explore how people experience reflection in games, capture design knowledge of how to successfully design reflection-inducing game experiences, and develop games following a reflective game design approach that successfully induce reflection in their players, facilitating transfer from game experiences to everyday cultural and social realities.",1,0

851,96865,Yes,Promoting change in approaching intimate partner violence through the analysis of public media and health experts knowledge,"Over the last few decades, intimate partner violence (IPV) has increasingly gained public attention and has been established as a gender-based issue and a priority concern in the international policy agenda. Despite remarkable achievements, effective transformations are strongly bound to established forms of social knowledge and unequal gender relations. Drawing on a gender perspective, and integrating it with psychological, social, and political theories, this study aims to explore the dynamics of social understandings and practices related to intimate partners violence interacting with broader changes. More precisely, this proposal looks at how the recent notion of IPV is symbolically signified, negotiated and shaped in the public sphere and in the institutional arena, by conducting field studies in two European countries, Italy and the UK. Common sense thinking and expert knowledge of IPV are analysed and compared: public knowledge is scrutinised through the analysis of media news and representations while institutional knowledge is investigated through the analysis of health professionals’ approaches. The rationale of the cross-cultural comparison between UK and Italy rests on their remarkable differences in terms of approach to the feminist perspective, to gender equality and ethnic diversity. It is expected that the present proposal might contribute to a sounder understanding of how IPV is represented in society and, ultimately, to its prevention in the European context.",1,1

Both are increasingly common, chronic illnesses, currently affecting nearly 1 million patients in Europe. CD and UC affect patients early in life, seriously impairing their quality of life and resulting in enormous personal, social, and economic costs.There is evidence suggesting that genetic factors play a key role in IBD pathogenesis, pointing towards a polygenic mode of inheritance for CD and UC. However, to date studies have only addressed the influence of single mutations on IBD, resulting in a poor prediction of clinical course or response to therapy in individual patients. The IBDchip Project will develop an easy to use DNA array. This non-invasive tool will allow the simultaneous analysis of around 100 relevant mutations to predict the clinical evolution, the risk of developing IBD-related complications, and the likelihood of responding to certain drugs of each IBD patient. The project will have four main phases of work: 1. Two main retrospective studies including 1000 CD and 1000 UC patients across Europe. These studies will be aimed at defining the best combination of mutations resulting in an optimal prediction of each clinical outcome. 2. Three prospective studies specifically designed to address prediction of patients' response to immunosuppressive and anti-TNF therapies, which will validate the information provided by the retrospective studies. 3. A technical optimization process of the IBDchip, expected to result in a faster, cheaper, and easier to use tool. 4. Finally, the exploration of pathways to clinical service, ethical and legal issues, and cost-effectiveness of the IBDchip, to ensure its uptake in routine clinical practice.

This will be achieved by (i) spending an outgoing phase of 24 months at the world-class Geography Department of the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), working in close collaboration with my mentor Professor John Agnew, an internationally renowned political geographer; (ii) conducting an extensive literature review, drawing on diverse disciplines such as human geography, social anthropology, sociology and social movement studies; (iii) presenting my own conceptual developments in research seminars to multidisciplinary academic audiences; and (iv) applying these theoretical insights to a specific empirical case study by conducting ethnographic fieldwork on forced displacement among black communities in Colombia. This proposal is of high relevance to the EU as it will (i) allow me to significantly consolidate and widen my research career prospects with an international dimension; (ii) promote the development and subsequent transfer back to Europe of my research competencies on my return to the University of Glasgow; and (iii) provide important data and insights for EU-Colombia relations and EU policies in the fields of terrorism, human rights, democratisation and minority rights.",1,1
86,109861,Yes,Reinforcing cooperation with Eastern Partnership countries on bridging the gap between research and innovation for inclusive and secure societies,"The overall aim of the SECURE-R2I project is to reinforce cooperation with Eastern Partnership Countries (EPC) on bridging the gap between research and innovation for Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 6. “Inclusive, Innovative and Secure Societies”. The research domains encompassed by “Inclusive, Innovative and Secure Societies” are broad. From the perspective of FP7 thematic priorities, they include ICT; Security; Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials (NMP); and Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). These research domains also form the basis of important economic sectors in the EPC, with many potential benefits for the EU, but which also need European support to increase their exploitation. Addressing this issue, the SECURE-R2I project will assist R&D and innovation (RDI) organisations in EPC via a range of knowledge and technology transfer activities with the support of European specialists. The activities include: • Networking between EPC organisations involved in RDI for Societal Challenge 6: It consists in mapping EPC RDI organisations and organising brokerage events to stimulate cooperation; • Analysing the tech transfer opportunities and bottlenecks of EPC organisations involved in RDI for Societal Challenge 6: It consists in surveying these organisations and holding discussions with representatives of government, industry, government and intermediary bodies; • Exchanging best practices in knowledge/technology transfer via a range of specific training courses and intensive summer schools in Europe; • Twinning via R2I pilot projects: Each EPC research partner in the consortium will twin with another consortium partner who will support them to implement a bilateral R2I pilot project; • Providing innovation support services to selected, high-potential EPC (and European) RDI: The activities will consist in coaching and advisory services on innovation and tech-transfer.",0,1
267,206930,No,Fighting Over Land: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Colombia,"This proposal aims to develop a research agenda on the long-term effect on civil conflict on institutions, particularly on land tenure structure. I start by building a theoretical model to establish the mechanisms and incentives through which actors involved in an armed conflict may be interested on fighting over the control and property rights of rural land. The resulting theoretical hypotheses will be tested using a truly unique, plot-level census data set that I digitised from Official Archives of the province of Antioquia, a Colombian region highly exposed to violence over the last fifty years. This dataset contains plot-level census data collected in 1950-55 for tax purposes. Additionally, I utilise similar plot-level census data for 1995 and 2000. These historical data sets can be easily matched to current cadastral information, available from 2006 onward. Hence, I will have comparable plot-level census datasets from Antioquia for four different periods, which coincide with the main shift of the intensity and expansion of the Colombian conflict. The exogenous nature of the different episodes of the conflict will provide the spatial and temporal variation to identify the effect of violence on land tenure. Several concerns might arise about the potential non-randomness of violence. While I cannot entirely resolve these (i.e. war is not random), I propose different strategies to test the robustness of my results. The contribution of this proposal is twofold. First, this proposal will contribute to the literature on land related conflict and the social consequences of conflict. Second, I provide technical support to many land restitution policies launched in post-conflict settings.",0,0
461,101559,No,Optimising Subsidiary Crop Applications in Rotations,"There is a need to improve sustainability in farming systems particularly through soil care and improvement, but not at the expense of productivity. One approach is to focus on a comprehensive advance in conservation tillage. This will be developed from improved ways of integrating subsidiary crops (SC) as living or dead mulches or cover crops with the main crops in rotations so as to simultaneously improve crop nutrition, health, and productivity. The SC will deliver multiple ecological services by increasing the duration of soil cover in the rotation overall while increasing species diversity, minimising the use of tillage and agrochemicals, enhancing biological N fixation and soil C content, and both reducing water demand in dry climates and improving soil workability in wetter climates. The research will draw on a wide range of previous and ongoing EU and related projects and will be based on 11 coordinated field experiments in different climatic regions together with three long-term experiments in Europe and Brazil. These experiments will all be assessed for economic and ecological impact including the often neglected issue of legume root health. Breeding companies and manufacturers of agricultural equipment from all regions of interest will be involved in finding adapted solutions for the different environments by extending the range of potentially useful plant species and by developing appropriate machinery to promote adoption in practical agriculture. The potential for useful chemical extraction from the existing and novel SCs will also be investigated. A central deliverable will be a database supported 'Cover Crop and Living Mulch Toolbox'  and Decision Support Tool which will encourage multilingual stakeholder exchange and dissemination during and beyond the lifetime of the project so as to capture farmer experience. The results of the project as a whole will be of use for and improve sustainability in low-input, organic, and conventional farming systems.",0,0
917,99302,No,"""""Star, gas and dust in star forming regions: studying Star Formation Rate tracers at small galactic scales""""","'Knowledge of the properties of the stellar population and the star formation activity in galaxies is essential to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies. Multi-wavelength data have been used to parameterize the star formation rate (SFR) of different types of galaxies, but most of them are strongly affected by the presence of dust in the interiors of the star forming regions. Although a considerable analysis has been carried out from a statistical point of view in identifying new SFR indicators, little has been done to corroborate the spatial correlation of the luminosities proposed as tracers of the star formation and the geometries of the gas and dust relative to the positions where the stars form in HII regions. The study of the emission distribution in HII regions at the wavelengths of the recently proposed SFR indicators and its relation to the action of the stellar winds and supernova explosions that strongly affect the distribution of the interstellar medium, offers an opportunity to test the hypotheses that have been previously assumed in the statistical studies. The research lines presented here will take advantage of the IR Telescope HERSCHEL already launched by the European Space Agency in May 2009. The observations from HERSCHEL have the best spatial resolution ever and represent a key set of data to better understand the role of the dust in star-forming regions. I present here a project that combines HERSCHEL data with multi-wavelength observations in order to perform a study of the stellar, gas and dust components in star forming regions in nearby galaxies. A key goal of this project is to prove the commonly used assumptions in the derivation of SFR indicators for galaxies of different types and environments.  With this work I will significantly improve our understanding of the way massive star formation affects galaxy evolution.'""",0,0
1011,64641,No,Scientific knowledge assessment and information technology,"Specific Objectives  1) To investigate new relations between science and governance, concentrating on issues of risks and trust;  2) To support EU policies on the accessibility and reliability of information, by deploying the best available knowledge, both formal (institutional analysis, multi-criteria decision aid, NUSAP scheme) and informal (e.g. participatory methods);  3) To develop a methodology to analyse and to assess the reliability and quality of the information to be used in the formulation of public policies in which science and technology play a specific role;  4) To explore 'cyber contexts' (in the framework of European projects), enabling the joint participation of experts, administrators, and wide sectors of the community in policy decision processes by designing, developing and applying Internet based multi-media interactive tools.  The results of these complementary projects will contribute towards the formulation of alternative well-documented options for future sustainable management policies in Europe.  5) To explore the relation between two complementary aspects to governance, electronic and extended ('e2-governance'). Planned Deliverables  Specific deliverables to DGs:  Framework and Guidelines - Report on guidelines for a NUSAP protocol and specifications for a prototype software implementation for knowledge assessment; - Framework and guidelines for new interfaces for science & governance: design and deployment of ICT-based scientific tools to be used with non-scientific audiences (July 2002); - In support of DG ENV & EEA: to develop and to test an integrated methodology for environmental assessment in a case study proposed by the customers (in collaboration with IPSC 24); - In support of the Water Framework Directive to draft guidelines on participatory approaches to Basin Planning and Management and establishing validation tools for testing the Guidance prepared, including pilot testing in one or more Members States and in consultation with stakeholders.  As a result of the research:  - Reports and scientific papers; - Software development - Participation in several scientific and policy networks.  Summary of 2001 Deliverables: 31/12/2001  This project started at the end of 2000 developing from Project 38 (Integrated Assessment and Decision Support). During that year it has: - Developed the ALEPH method of multi-objective, multi-scale integrated representation for participatory strategic Integrated Assessment (Report on Methodology; Prototype Informatic Tool); - Produced inputs for the EC White Paper on Governance, and the JRC's Programme Directorate in the field of uncertainty and risks, and science and governance; - Participated and animated several scientific networks (EFIEA, TRUSTNET, ENSIPP); - Exploratory research: Integration of Sustainability into Sectoral Policies. In collaboration with IPSC 24. - New competitive projects: NESIS (with IPSC 24) and AIRP ACOMPANYING MEASURES (100% financed), SCA Virtualis and SCA Advisor; - Participation in several scientific conferences and workshops as invited keynote speakers.  Output Indicators and Impact  Output: - Prototype software tool for knowledge assessment; - Guidelines for deploying ICT-based participatory tools.  Impact: - Testing by customers; - Number of hits in the relevant websites. Summary of the project  The aim of the project is to apply a range of approaches and techniques in order to facilitate dialogue and participation of a wide variety of stakeholders in decision-making. It participates in the EC initiative on science and governance developing tools for the quality assurance of scientific inputs to policy processes in the emergent field of 'e2-governance'(electronic & extended).  Rationale  The Direct RTD Actions in the Fifth Framework Programme aim at the promotion of a 'sustainable information society', which encompasses the following principles:  - information society for all;  - the replacement of the 'command and control' approach to governance by shared responsibility between government institutions, business and the publics;  These two principles are interlinked, because the technology of the information society enables the implementation of the new approach to governance.  Information technologies have a great and growing power to provide information, quickly, cheaply, in large quantities to many users. But the technologies themselves for e-governance do not guarantee the quality of that information. The development of a sustainable information society requires public trust in the technology and the information it provides. The providers, users and regulators of the technologies must resolve many issues. These include the reliability of the information, the protection of the privacy, security and civil liberties of its users, and its accessibility by all sectors of society, as well as the openness, transparency and legitimacy of the technology and its governing institutions. Then the information technologies will realise their promise as the means for providing a forum for broad and effective citizens' participation in new forms of governance.  The application of a Knowledge Assessment (KA) approach encompasses the design and deployment of 'public-friendly' and state-of-the-art Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This project, using a Knowledge Assessment framework employing communication technology, aims at supporting this effort by integrating scientific and technological developments with their socio-economic, cultural and institutional contexts.  This research effort must be developed in close co-operation with and complementing national, regional, and community institutions, in order to promote the goals and diffuse the results and innovations.",0,0

399,57767,No,Tactile Interactive Multimedia Computer games for visually imparied children,"TIM is intended to conceive computer games usable by young blind children in an autonomous way, without assistance of a sighted person. TIM games can be used by children of various levels of psychomotor development who cannot use the keyboard (young children or children with multiple disabilities). The software has a ludic and educational role. For children with additional disabilities, like cognitive troubles, it can have a therapeutic role. TIM allows to adapt existing commercial computer games (reusing rich audio resources, with coherent educational and ludic contents) and to develop specific contents (fitting special needs of young blind children). The European dimension allows to reach the critical mass necessary to consider a realistic commercialisation, allowing TIM games to access end users: children. In that way the software is made to develop the games simultaneously in several languages.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The project will be achieved in 3 phases: During the first phase a Users Needs Report, based upon data collected during an inquiry and a workshop assembling researchers and professionals working with visually impaired children; a script language allowing to describe the scenario of games will be specified; and a software will be developed including several independent components dedicated to each kind of device (tactile boards, sound displays, speech synthesisers, Braille displays), an interpreter for the TIM language, multilingual features. The second phase will start by a semiotic analysis of existing games. Then several sets of games will be developed, corresponding to different kinds of children, according to the Users Needs Report. It will include the study of the different kinds of technologies usable to make the tactile adaptation sheets for TouchPads. Then reports about the adaptability and the methodology of adaptation will be written to be part of the final TIM software package. An educator who will visit the children in the major validation sites and play with them and the local professionals. He will report the game sessions and make videos. He will also have to broadcast a second inquiry, oriented to the preparation of the commercialisation. In parallel the Intellectual Property Rights issues will be studied out in order to prepare models of co-operation conventions and models of user licences for the games developed with the Adapting software. In the third phase the material built with the children (use reports and videos), will be the basis for the evaluation and study of cognitive process and educational potential, focussing 3 main issues: educative, therapeutically and learning. The different components will be assembled to produce the complete 'TIM software' package, which will be a pre-commercial prototype including software, reports and juridical models. In parallel an exploitation plan will be proposed.  MILESTONES The basis for this project is a complete study of Users Needs. The expected result is a complete package including: - software (adapting tool) allowing to use audio/tactile features (tactile board, sounds, speech synthesisers, Braille displays - reports about adaptability and methodology - models of conventions This will be completed by reports about educational potential, therapeutically potential and learning potential.

548,90429,No,European Clearing House for Open Robotics Development,"The European robotics industry plays a key role in maintaining our continent's industrial base. The robotics industry is strong, but fragmented and dispersed. In the future, cutting-edge technology resulting from top-level research will be the decisive factor for success. Europe not only has a powerful robotics industry, but can also boast superb research. By drawing on these resources, ECHORD aims at producing new knowledge through advancing the state of the art in selected research foci and developing novel technology from which new products can be derived. Within ECHORD, opportunities for knowledge advancement and technology transfer between academia and industry will be created across the whole continent. This will be achieved through the solicitation of focused, small-size RTD projects, so-called experiments, which can be rapidly negotiated, funded and executed. Via these experiments, ECHORD will bring about a large-scale introduction of robotic equipment into research institutions. This is expected to result in both tangible and measurable out-comes in terms of the accelerated development of technologies, as well as the deployment of robotics technology into new scenarios for the direct application of research results. For ECHORD, three such scenarios have been defined: human-robot co-working, hyper flexible cells, and cognitive factories.

373,17269,No,Joint Academic Network Using Satellite for European Distance Education and Training,"This proposal is the first of a two-stage development. The ultimate aim is to establish in 1990 a private voice and date network satellite to link up European institutions wishing to work together to produce jointly distance teaching and training materials for delivery on a European-wide basis, and wishing to transfer credits between institutions. However, in order to do this, a number of technical, regulatory, educational and organisational issues have to be resolved. The aim of this proposals is to carry out the work that will enable the full project to be successfully implemented, in the form of a feasibility study. However, it should be noted that the feasibility study on its own will result in improved communications facilities between European educational industrial establishments.   A feasibility study is suggested:   i) to determine the cost and design specifications for an appropriate earth station for a voice and data network to link up European distance teaching institutions that can operate on the next generation of European satellites, ii) to develop appropriate software to improve the user-friendliness of terminals or work-stations for European-wide communications, and to facilitate the interface with satellite earth stations, iii) to develop improved operating procedures for computer conferencing, text transfer and editing at a distance, iv) to identify and if possible resolve the regulatory and cost issues resulting from the European-wide use of two-way voice and data via satellite for educational and training purposes.   The ultimate aim is to develop and install relatively low-cost, narrow-band, two-way earth stations at each site (13 initially, in 10 countries in the second stage project), which will allow two-way voice communication between any two sites, audio conferencing across all sites for course team meetings and administrative meetings on credit transfer, electronic mail and computer conferencing facilities for transfer of draft teaching texts, minutes of meetings, etc., and an experimental video-conferencing facility at 64kbs. The network will be used to support the design and development of course materials for courses in four areas: European Law, European Business Studies, European Culture, and European Languages. These courses will be offered in all the 10 participating countries.   In order thought for this project to be implemented successfully, it is necessary to develop a European- designed earth station capable of working with the new range of European satellites (OLYMPUS, Eutelsat II, Astra). The feasibility study aims to draw up a detailed design specification and to estimate accurately the likely costs of development of such an earth station. Secondly, currently operating procedures for electronic mail, computer conferencing, remote editing, and access to remote data-bases on wide area networks are not user friendly.

870,94776,No,Subjectivity and Self-Effectivity. Investigating Self-Determination in Mentally Ill People from the First-Person-Perspective,"The fellowship improves Jann E. Schlimme’s scientific and complementary skills in the interdisciplinary field of philosophy and psychiatry. In this research project self-determination in mentally ill people will be investigated in terms of self-effectivity (SE) from the First-Person-Perspective. At first a detailed description of the experiential structure of the process of SE will be achieved by applying a phenomenological method. Then this structure of SE will be investigated more thoroughly in constant comparison with understandings of mental disorders (e.g. addiction, suicidality). It is expected that SE is a crucial process for self-determination and that therefore characteristics of self-determination and of its special impairments in mental disorders can be spelled out in terms of SE. The results will be published. Schlimme is a clinically excellently trained senior registrar and senior lecturer for psychiatry at Hannover Medical School with an interdisciplinary academic education. Though he is an experienced researcher in psychiatry applying methods rooted in humanities, he needs a profound (philosophical) training for reaching professional maturity in this interdisciplinary field. In this fellowship he will be trained under the supervision of Sonja Rinofner-Kreidl at the department of Philosophy (University of Graz) and integrated in her working group. The fellowship enables him to achieve the necessary skills for a professorship. The project’s topic is of principal importance for psychiatry, since regaining, stabilizing and improving the patient’s self-determination is the major goal of psychiatry and needs new attention due to radical changes in our understanding of subjectivity. The detailed description of the experiential structure of the process of SE opens the field of self-determination for further research and helps to improve psychiatric treatment in the EU via describing guidelines regarding the empowerment of mentally ill people.",0,0

109,227881,Yes,"Poverty, Child Protection and Parents' Participation","The proposed project aims to promote innovative, poverty-aware forms of parents' participation and family inclusion practices in child protection policy and practice. More specifically, it intends to strengthen the connection between three bodies of knowledge—poverty, child protection, and parent participation. Parent advocacy programmes, that are gradually developed to support family inclusion and parents' participation at the practice and policy levels, are demonstrating positive outcomes, both in terms of proximal and distal outcomes. Even though, current programmes are mainly based outside of Europe and tend to lack a firm theoretical and ethical base that informs practice in ways that address poverty, other social inequalities, and child protection practice. Given the increasing numbers of children living in socio-economic hardship in more than two thirds of the OECD countries, alongside rising numbers of children involved in the child protection and court systems in various EU countries, developing such practices is a necessity for promoting the well-being and rights of children and Therefore the study aims are:(1) To map, describe, and conceptualize the development and application of parent advocacy programmes in England. (2) To explore the experiences and perspectives of all stakeholders who participate in parent advocacy programmes (3) To examine and theorize the relevance of poverty-aware approaches to parent advocacy programmes. (4) To empirically enrich and further develop the complex relationship between poverty and maltreatment. The research project will employ a qualitative in-depth case study approach that will involve a preliminary survey of all existing advocacy initiatives in England and in-depth inquiry of 4-6 parent advocacy programs. The case studies will include various qualitative methods and the analysis of the data will include thematic analysis and participatory data analysis.",1,1
434,45018,No,Trafficking pathways of normal and pathologic isoforms of the prion protein,"The appearance of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Europe and its possible transmission to humans has put a priority on research on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). TSE are long known fatal neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals that are characterized by dementia, motor dysfunction, and cerebral amyloidosis. These disorders are unique because they can be either infectious, genetic or sporadic in origin. All three forms result from a posttranslational alteration in the conformation of a host-encoded membrane glycoprotein called PrPc, which stands for the cellular isoform of the prion protein. Conversion of this normal isoform from an a-helical, readily proteolysed surface protein, to the scrapie isoform of PrP, PrPSc, a highly protease resistant, B-pleated sheet-containing hydrophobic aggregate is not only diagnostic of TSE infection, but is widely taken to be the defining infectious event and source of the subsequent neuropathology. Little is know about PrP which has a central role in TSE as demonstrated by the absolute relationship between PrP expression and development or transmission of TSE. Defining the mechanisms underlying the generation of prpSc from PrPc has now become one of the central issues in understanding the pathogenesis of prion diseases.   It is our contention that the conversion of prion protein from PrPc, to the pathogenic PrPSc, is strongly influenced by, and almost certainly requires, the normal trafficking of prion protein on cells. This perspective has important implications, not only for understanding the basic mechanism of the disease, but also for developing prophylactic and therapeutic measures, and for diagnosis. Despite the intense research interest in TSE, the cellular basis for the pathogenic conversion of PrP is an area that is relatively neglected, and many basic facts need to be established.   We propose here a coordinated effort to examine the trafficking of the different isoforms of PrP, in a cohesive strategy to understand the function and the pathogenic conversion of the protein. This project uniquely combines highly complementary and multi-disciplinary generic technologies of individual members with well characterized experimental systems. These technologies and systems comprise computer modeling, in-vitro system, functional assays and cell culture models, all of which in combination will allow us to examine the trafficking of normal and pathologic forms of PrP from synthesis to degradation.   Importantly, this proposal brings five groups that have not   previously worked oz TSE together with two more experienced groups in the field. This is a unique opportunity to join forces and benefit, on one hand, from the expertise of groups working previously on Alzheimer's Disease, protein modeling, cellular trafficking or glycolipids, and on the other hand, of well trained groups working on TSE.   The general measurable objectives of this proposal are: i) defining the biosynthetic pathways and maturation of PrP, ii) understanding the molecular basis of the endocytosis and recycling of the protein on the cell surface, iii) analyzing the proteolitic cleavage of PrP and its importance in the function and the conversion of the protein, and iv) examining the degradation of PrP in normal cells, and in cells infected with TSE. Achievement of the assigned objectives will generate comprehensive information about the fate of PrP in the cell and will lead to new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TSE.",0,0

Objectives are: (1) to contribute to our knowledge of modality effects on linguistic structure; (2) to contribute to the theoretical debate on the issue of language modularity; (3) to gain insight how mediated learning experiences can inform deaf children’s organization of their signed and spoken language systems; (4) to provide a model of how language learning occurs in deaf children in a short and very structured way. To receive objectives 1 and 2, deaf children’s understanding of different form-meaning mappings in signed and spoken language will be assessed during step 1 ; stimuli include vocabulary tasks and a rating scale to measure mode of acquisition of word meanings. To receive objectives 3 and 4, a test-teach-test paradigm is used in step 2, which includes the combined use of static (i.e., vocabulary test) and dynamic (i.e., mediated learning) assessments. By acquiring training and expertise at both host universities, the applicant will be in a position to effectively disseminate his expertise on an international level in his further expertise in research and teaching within the EU. The spreading of this expertise within the European Research Area  will help establish successful co-ordination and co-operation across national borders. Furthermore, the project will make an important contribution to the development of appropriate assessment and intervention for young deaf language users. Long-term, this work will help to enable deaf graduates to pursue a degree in Higher Education and, possibly, a career in science.

473,212725,No,Instabilities and homoclinic phenomena in Hamiltonian systems,"A fundamental problem in the study of  dynamical systems is to ascertain whether the effect of a perturbation  on an integrable Hamiltonian system accumulates over time and leads to a large effect (instability) or it averages out (stability). Instabilities in nearly integrable systems, usually called Arnold diffusion, take place along resonances and by means of a framework of partially hyperbolic invariant objects and their homoclinic and heteroclinic connections.  The goal of this project is to develop new techniques, relying on the role of invariant manifolds in the global dynamics, to prove the existence of physically relevant instabilities and homoclinic phenomena in several problems in celestial mechanics and Hamiltonian Partial Differential Equations.  The N body problem models the interaction of N puntual masses under gravitational force. Astronomers have deeply analyzed the role of resonances in this model. Nevertheless, mathematical results showing instabilities along them are rather scarce. I plan to develop a new theory to analyze the transversal intersection between invariant manifolds along mean motion and secular resonances to prove the existence of Arnold diffusion. I will also apply this theory to construct oscillatory motions.  Several Partial Differential Equations such as the nonlinear Schrödinger, the Klein-Gordon and the wave equations can be seen as infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Using dynamical systems techniques and understanding the role of invariant manifolds in these Hamiltonian PDEs, I will study two type of solutions: transfer of energy solutions, namely solutions that push energy to arbitrarily high modes as time evolves by drifting along resonances; and breathers, spatially  localized and periodic in time solutions, which in a proper setting can be seen as homoclinic orbits to a stationary solution.",0,0

167,195516,Yes,Investigating the interactions between civil wars and migration.,"Poor countries are often plagued by civil wars. They are also, in many cases, emigration countries. Anybody interested in the development of such countries must understand to what extent these phenomena are interrelated, and how they interplay with each other. If it is pretty clear that civil wars push people to leave the country, it remains understudied how diasporas play a role in the emergence and evolution of violent conflicts.  Indeed, the interactions between diasporas and conflict have roughly been overlooked by the economic literature to date, in spite of the very suggestive pieces of evidence provided by related research fields and of the very important policy questions that it raises – in particular, how to optimize the contribution of diasporas to peaceful development. Based on case studies such as those of Erytrea or of Sri Lanka, the literature in history and political science underlines diverse mechanisms through which diasporas have intervened in the evolution of violence in their home country, either as peace-builders or as peace-wreckers. On the other hand, in these case studies, the evolution of civil wars also appears to have been determinant of emigration and return migration patterns and, eventually, of the nature of diasporas’ involvement in the political situation in the homeland.  This project will investigate the joint dynamics of civil conflicts and migration in developing countries. It will first build a theoretical framework to characterize how diasporas and civil wars interact together, accounting for the endogeneity of both migration and violence. The theoretical predictions derived from this framework will then be empirically tested, relying on recent and original data. Through a multi-disciplinary perspective, nourished by the findings of the qualitative research and relying on economic tools – both theoretical and empirical – this project will allow to build the first comprehensive investigation of the diasporas – conflict nexus.",1,1
901,58585,No,Homologous recombination in plants (PLANTREC),"Major advances have been made in knowledge of plant genomes and the recombination processes regulating their structure and integrity. However exploitation of this is limited by absence of methodology for the targeted, in site modification of plant genes and chromosomes. In plants the somatic homologous recombination machinery is overwhelmed by another recombination process (NHEJ) , which causes incoming DNA to insert at a random position in the genome, often accompanied by unwanted rearrangements. This is an important reason for questioning the safety of transgenic crops. We directly address these issues and 5 academic and 2 industrial research groups together aim to develop novel tools to obtain gene targeting in plants, based on a detailed understanding of recombination in plants. The groups will contribute considerable novel expertise and biological material to the project: plant hyperecombination mutants, cloned genes and proven assays.",0,0
709,215498,No,The Fragmentary Constitutions of Aristotle,"One of the greatest minds of antiquity was no doubt Aristotle. He is usually studied or read as a philosopher. However, his entire life, Aristotle was also a researcher, fascinated by history. His most important historical work is his huge collection of Constitutions, which were a gold mine of unique information on the history and organization of the Greek city-states. Only the Athenian Constitution survives almost in its entirety. Of the other constitutions all that remains are 'fragments,' i.e. citations in extant writers, and the epitome by Heraclides Lembus. There are many editions and studies of the Athenian Constitution, but nothing comparable is found for the other constitutions. Therefore, my project will focus on the fragmentarily preserved constitutions, more specifically the 44 constitutions which were also included by Heraclides. My aim is to define the content and structure of the fragmentary Constitutions, study the link with Aristotle’s political philosophy, explore his reception and the relation to other ancient writers and identify the sources, method, historical value and authorship. For this purpose I will make an edition, translation and commentary of the fragments, which will be published as a book by Brill. This research will fill a major research gap in our knowledge of Aristotle’s lost works and his impact on western civilization. The Constitutions also offer valuable information on the political system and culture of many Greek cities. Ancient Greece is usually considered the ancestor of our modern democracy, but the reality is much more nuanced than we often make it out to be. The Constitutions can help us better understand the ancient world, which may serve as a mirror for modern discussions about justice, power, autonomy and government. LMU will be the perfect host for this project, since it gathers world-class authorities on Aristotle and hosts the Bavarian State Library, which contains one of the best classics collections in the world.",0,0
63,40574,Yes,Migration and ethnic identity. The interaction of Turkish and Greek immigrants in Brussels,"This proposal concerns the interaction of Turkish and Greek i migrants Brussels. The conception of this project is based on the hypothesis that there are cultural resemblances between the Turks and the Greeks, which result from their historical coexistence. It is argued that these common aspects are distorted after the construction of nationalism in Turkey and in Greece in the nineteenth century and they are disguised by the hostile political relations between the two countries. The aim of the project is to show how the interaction between the Turks and the Greeks change, when they coexist outside their national territories. Moreover, it will attempt to illuminate the ways in which their perceptions of self are influenced by their immigration experience. It will also examine the role that the European Community plays in the expression of their ethnic identities. This research project attempts to help the better understanding of inter-ethnic relations as they are expressed in a multicultural place such as Brussels.",1,1
686,59862,No,Hial - biofuels for chp plants - reduced emissions and cost reduction in the combustion of high alkali biofuels (HIAL),"Objectives and problems to be solved: The scientific objective of this proposal is to understand the influence of fuel composition and combustion conditions on the release of alkali metals, S and Cl to the gas phase considering different combustion systems. The technical objective of this proposal is to apply the understanding of the alkali chemistry to develop primary measures for grate firing to achieve SO2 emissions below 200 mg/Nm3 without the need for installation of flue gas desulphurisation unit (FGD). This can be carried out by improved capture of SO2 in the bottom and fly ash by changing the operational parameters. Moreover, this understanding is the necessary prerequisite for a suppression of alkali induced corrosion attack allowing an increase in the reliability of operation and an increase of the straw share in co-combustion processes. Description of work: The work of the project is carried out in three work packages. In work package WP-1 (Sampling and characterisation) different kinds of straw from different European countries will be sampled and characterised by chemical and thermal analysis. In work package WP-2 (Combustion Chemistry and Release) the combustion chemistry and the release of alkali metals, S and Cl will be investigated. This work package is the main work package and it includes most of the experimental work. The release of the alkali metals, S and Cl will be investigated by bench scale experiments using modern mass spectrometric techniques and different kinds of combustion technique (fixed bed, fluidised-bed and suspension combustion) with and without coal co-combustion. The industrial partners of the project will give their experience based on the operation of full-scale power plants into this work package. The results obtained by fundamental mass spectrometric release measurements and the bench scale combustion experiments will be used to develop qualitative models predicting the release of alkali metals, S and Cl for different fuels and combustion conditions. In work package WP-3 (Commercial application) full-scale tests on existing straw-fired CHP plants will be carried out at the end of the project. This work package implements the R&D results for commercial use. The results will be directly used in existing straw-fired plants and for the development of new straw-fired CHP plants that are characterised by a high efficiency and low costs for the energy production. Expected Results and Exploitation Plans: A clear understanding of the complex release chemistry of K, Na, S, and Cl in different combustion systems will be elaborated. Primary low cost measures to lower the SO2 emissions of existing straw fired plants in Europe will result. Exploitation of results is ascertained by the two industrial companies involved in the project since they have high interest in investments in new HIAL fuel fired CHP plants if attractive economies can be provided. The project increases the competitive strength of the European industry in a field of increasing importance due to the environmental constraints. This will then result in wide market opportunities within Europe and globally.",0,0
425,205920,No,Tidal Turbine Power Take-Off Accelerator,"In this project we will design, build and test an innovative Direct Drive Power Take-Off (PTO) solution for tidal turbines.   The consortium’s aim in this project is to reduce the lifetime cost of tidal power by 20%, demonstrated by accelerated life testing of a next-generation tidal turbine power take-off (PTO) solution. Project outputs will be independently verified, and will enable:   1.  Improved performance: 20% Lifetime Cost of Energy improvement over a conventional PTO 2.  Improved reliability: extending service intervals from less than 1 year to over 2 years 3.  Verified survivability: PTO design lifetime greater than 20 years  The results will be disseminated and exploited to maximise the benefit of this project to the ocean energy sector, and to raise investor and market confidence in the emerging tidal energy industry.  In order to verify the technology, we will conduct accelerated onshore and in-sea testing of a prototype PTO and achieve third party validation of the design and the test results. In parallel we will develop a commercialisation strategy for selling and licensing the product to tidal energy technology developers, and explore potential uses outside the tidal sector, such as wave power and marine propulsion.  The project is led by Nova Innovation, a world-leading tidal energy technology and project developer. Project partners are: SKF, Siemens, The University of Edinburgh, Delft Technical University, Wood Group and the Center for Wind Power Drives RWTH Aachen University.  This proposal is being submitted to the call LCE-07-2016-2017: Developing the next generation technologies of renewable electricity and heating/cooling, and is perfectly aligned with the scope of the call: to increase the performance and reliability of ocean energy subsystems.",0,0
129,97112,Yes,Understanding and Supporting Families with Complex Needs,"Understanding and supporting families with multiple and complex needs is an area of policy and practice that is gaining importance and emphasis across the European Union and beyond. This growing policy interest is mirrored by emergent theoretical and empirical research in various countries. Despite this interest, a recent international research review of approaches to supporting families with complex needs, carried out by Morris, Hughes, Clarke and colleagues (2008) at the University of Birmingham, illustrates a stark paucity of academic analyses of policy and practice concerned specifically with ‘family’ in relation to a number of service user groups and marginalised communities. That which exists appears fragmented, with little coherency to the international knowledge base regarding current approaches, effective practice or appropriate research methodologies. This proposal therefore seeks to exploit existing and potential links between divergent disciplines and knowledge streams, both nationally and internationally, to enhance understandings of family-focused approaches across domains of social care, education, and health. It will explore theoretical frameworks, models and approaches dominant in particular practice settings, and their impact in responding to specific needs of families in each partner country. It will also explore the challenges, tensions and contradictions in implementing family-focused policies and practices, and the implications for professional knowledge and frameworks, and associated training. Drawing on the varying expertise of each partner, it will test strategies to address the challenges in the design of family-centred evaluation and research able to effectively capture the experiences for whole families, as families as well as individuals. In doing so, it will develop a network of universities with expertise in family-related research and form the basis for a much wider network, able to utilise and contribute to our analyses.",1,1
769,38935,No,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY POLICIES and BROAD INDUSTRIAL POLICY,"The purpose of this proposal is:   (i) to map out in detail how industrial policy (in its broadest sense) at the national and regional level has changed and adapted to European level initiatives in science and technology (S&T) of the last two decades:  (ii) to use these country-based studies as the basis for a series of horizontal, thematic studies which give comparative perspective to developments;  (iii) to analyse the inter-relationships, or co-evolution, of policies between the different spheres and levels of government and, in the light of this, to consider how best policy between these different levels may be co-ordinated.   Most studies of the European Union's S&T policies concentrate, not surprisingly, on the development and impact of policy at the European level. This proposal starts instead at the national and regional level and charts the development of policy at that level over the last 15-20 years. It is conceived within the intellectual framework of national systems of innovation, seen here as nationally-based sets of institutions and rules and routines which govern these institutions. The central issue is how these systems adapt and re-organise themselves to accommodate the emergence of a new, supra-national player which, like governments, can change the rules and create new institutions. How far is there a process of mutual adaptation or 'co-evolution' taking place? What implications might this have for co-ordination?   The proposal addresses the Commission's interest in the inter-relationships of policy both between different policy areas and between the different levels of government within the Union. The second phase, horizontal studies, also help address the issue of comparative developments between the Community and its Triad trading partners.   The study will be undertaken by a team of researchers, co-ordinated by the Science Policy Research Unit, from six countries within the Union. Each brings to the project expertise and knowledge of developments in their own country but specialist expertise in other areas - developments in Japan and the US, regional policies and the workings of the Structural Funds, relationships between large and small firms and the processes of technology transfer. The aim is to capture this knowledge and capabilities in a series of studies which will not only inform the policy debate within the Community, but also contribute to a wider understanding of the processes which have contributed to the building of the EU and the making of contemporary history.",1,0
213,225743,No,Virtual eye model system for personalised refractive surgery treatment,"The incidence of myopia is predicted to rise from 28% of the global population in 2010 to almost 50% in 2050. Factors such as population aging and increase of hours spent in front of screens are driving the increase in global eye deficits. Vision impairments reduce the quality of life, affect economic and educational opportunities and increase the risk of death. This is particularly important for vulnerable groups such as elderly, children, workers and drivers. Overall, WHO reported that uncorrected vision was responsible for €241bn of productivity loss per year worldwide. Our innovative Virtual Eye Model System (VEMoS) is based on patented revolutionary ophthalmic diagnostic devices (CSO’s MS-39 tomographer/topographer and the unique open-field aberrometer), as well as on innovative simulation software developed by Vissum. Overall, our innovation provides personalised clinical-decision support based on each patient’s eye measurements and neural network simulations of post-surgery outcomes, improving surgery success and patient satisfaction rates.  By combining CSO’s ophthalmic high-tech hardware design, manufacturing and commercialisation skills with Vissum’s refractive surgery and software development and independent clinical testing by CHUC and AUH, this project is expected to bring economic, social and health impacts, including progress towards achieving the EC action plan on personalised medicine “ICPerMed”. Our goal is to mature, scale-up and demonstrate the production of the VEMoS system, targeting ophthalmology clinics as clients, and with the aim to standardise refractive surgery decision making and revolutionise the refractive surgery field with personalised treatments. A successful VEMoS project will allow us to create measurable impacts on our companies, quantified as accumulated revenue of €145.3m in five years (2022-2026), equal to accumulated operating profit of €58.2m, creating 60 full time employments, and generating €37m in reduced customer costs.",0,0
706,96289,No,COMPANIONS: persistent multi-modal interfaces to the Internet,"The COMPANIONS vision is that of a personalized, conversational interface to the Internet, one that knows its owner, on a range of platforms, indoor and nomadic, based on integrated high-quality research in multimodal human-computer interfaces, intelligent agents, and human language technology. This is a research agenda bound by a metaphor, that of the COMPANION, an artefact for the large groups of EU citizens whom the Internet simply does not serve as well as it does the academics who invented it. Among those groups are those who live alone: up to 40% of the population of advanced societies will live alone within 20 years, only half of them old. They will be in need of interactive company, conversation and diversion, over and above their need to use the Internet to get information or use chatrooms, or, increasingly, to make sense of their own digital repositories (texts, videos, images) as well as information held about themselves. These needs have not been well met by current interfaces based on browsing, profiling and adaptation, and there is good evidence that a more directly personal language-using persistent interface will be more acceptable. Our case in this proposal is that the technical basis for a Companion agent to the Internet is now in view: and what is needed is a fresh research effort to bring stronger methods of machine learning to bear on these three modalities and their integration. Within 4 years a new integration of existing and novel techniques can be achieved that will together provide a striking advance over anything currently demonstrable, and that enough can be shown after an eighteen month effort to attract the attention of major industrial players. The Consortium contains centres with outstanding world expertise in the application of Machine Learning (particularly Bayesian methods) to problems of speech and language and these will be extended to language-vision correlations; it will function in at least one new EU language (Czech).",0,0

SSI promises to empower European organisations to speed up, secure and automate transactions with customers, suppliers and partners, resulting in tens of billions of euros savings annually on administrative costs in Europe. SSI promises to drive a new business ecosystem with thousands of new jobs, new job categories and new business opportunities for existing and new European companies.  SSI is not a self-fulfilling promise. While so-called SSI ‘solutions’ are popping up all over the world, the vast majority has a local scope, i.e. they solve a problem in a specific domain, they do not scale (at every level they need to, e.g. at the technical, process, information and business levels), and scarcely interoperate. Addressing these issues is a top priority for the eSSIF-Lab project.   eSSIF-Lab (European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Laboratory) is a lab-to-market project for ICT-24 subtopic 1-b “strengthening internet trustworthiness with electronic identities”, that facilitates the further development, integration and adoption of SSI technologies through a cascade funding approach targeting innovative companies developing SSI based solutions. eSSIF-Lab is championed by leading experts in SSI technologies, cascade funding, business acceleration and continuous deployment of open-source software. eSSIF-Lab will award 62 subgrants in 2 types of open calls, 1 targeting technical enhancements and extensions of the SSI framework (20 subgrants, for SMEs, startups, self-employed individuals, academic innovators, and innovators from larger organisations), and 2 targeting SSI business and social innovations and applications (42 subgrants, for SMEs and startups). The project will  provide business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market propositions, and to accelerate SSI-related businesses and social applications.

343,199439,No,PowerKite - Power Take-Off System for a Subsea Tidal Kite,"The PowerKite project will design, build and deploy a power take-off system (PTO) for novel tidal energy collector concept, the Deep Green subsea tidal kite. The overall objective of the PowerKite project is to gather experience in open sea conditions to enhance the structural and power performance of the PTO for a next generation tidal energy converter to ensure high survivability, reliability and performance, low environmental impact and competitive cost of energy in the (future) commercial phases. The core innovation of the project resides in the electro-mechanical design of the PTO, allowing the array to be deployed in sites with low velocity currents. The project will develop full-scale components of the turbine, generator, seabed power electronics, array transformer and subsea export cable. The project will also develop a new material for the mooring system (tether) combining the required buoyancy (to avoid the seafloor and the surface) with the appropriate modulus, strength and fatigue properties (to hold an oscillating load of 200 tons). Open sea trials will play a crucial role in the project as the deployment of the first full scale Deep Green prototype (funded via separate ERDF funding) will enable extensive offshore data collection for the PTO system. The Powerkite project has the potential to double the tidal power market potential, decrease the cost of energy with up to 60% and decrease the weight per installed MW at least 20 times compared to other tidal energy converters.

153,221992,Yes,State disintegration in the context of macroeconomic crisis - the case of Yugoslavia,"'The Eurozone financial and economic crisis, Brexit, the rise of Euroscepticism, nationalist voices and populism, as well as the fall in public support for the European Union (EU) have brought concerns over European (dis)integration and Eurozone prospects to the top of the political agenda and academic discussions. DISMAC-Y places itself at the heart of these preoccupations and proposes to draw lessons from the process of political disintegration of Yugoslavia. This historicization of the European experience using a case study of a country that is known for its federalist-like state structures, complex multi-scalar governance, and uneven regional development, is a highly innovative research enterprise that fills the political economist and comparativist 'blind spots' in the existing sholarship on Yugoslavia's breakup. The restructuring of Yugoslav monetary regime is taken as the entry point of the research that draws on newly available material resources and builds on original framework to explore disintegrative interactions between different actors and fields of Yugoslav economy in a historical political economy perspective. By providing a systemic study on the political and economic role of monetary regime in the period of macroeconomic crisis, DISMAC-Y makes the Yugoslav experience analytically comparable to other similar experiences of political (dis)integration, especially the European one. Hence, it considerably shifts the existing frontiers of the scholarship on Yugoslavia and deepens our understanding of the European integration and monetary experiences.'",1,1
131,108642,Yes,European Agencies and Epistemic Communities: Engines of European Integration in Internal Security?,"This project examines an important, but under-researched topic, namely the role of the growing number of European agencies dealing with internal security matters in European integration. More precisely, it investigates whether European agencies are 'engines' of European integration in internal security and, if yes, how and to which extent they fulfil that role. Pollack (2003) has emphasised that the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice have all played an important, albeit varied, role as engines of European integration alongside the governments of the Member States. It is true that the powers of agencies are more limited than those of these three institutions. They do not propose, adopt or annul legislation, but are specialised and 'depoliticised' administrative structures that perform the generally technical tasks that have been delegated to them (Majone 2006). However, they should not be readily dismissed as possible engines of European integration. Indeed, agencies have knowledge and knowledge is a form of power. It is therefore important to examine the extent to, if any, and the ways in which the growing number of European internal security agencies have influenced policy-making and European integration in internal security matters. In order to answer these questions, the project develops an analytical framework drawing upon the literature on 'epistemic communities', which are particular networks of knowledge-based experts. The project examines whether each of the nine European internal security agencies belongs to an epistemic community and, if yes, the extent to which this epistemic community has sought and managed to influence policy-making - thereby enabling the agency to act as an engine of European integration through its membership of the epistemic community. It is expected that the project will generate highly original and relevant findings, which will have a major impact on academic and policy debates.",1,1

The main objective of TRADEX is to set up a trial for assessing solutions resulting from recent research activities on digital object exchange, with the aims of enhancing the marketing of tradable multimedia related to cultural heritage.  TRADEX will carry out an international co-operation for the establishment of a world-wide common working platform (Japanese actors are involved), deploy the results of European research in the field of electronic treatment of IPR, foster the penetration of methodologies and technologies towards cultural institutions and governments, contribute to create a critical mass of buyers and sellers of cultural digital objects, identify solutions to be recommended to the involved governments as technical annexes to national directives.  Work description: TRADEX restricts the trial domain to the on-line multimedia object transfer. At technological level, TRADEX will first consider available copyright marking technologies for solving the illegal copying and proof of ownership problems in the context of multimedia objects. TRADEX will focus on the convergence on common criteria for: - content fidelity preservation; - robustness to attack; - applicability to audio, image, and video data, including synthetic objects.  TRADEX assumes the e-commerce scheme based on digital signature and public key encryption. This introduces further points of which common background should be agreed, such as the integration of digital signature and watermarking techniques, and Digital Object Identification and ownership certification.  Thanks to the involvement of Smart Card producer, new-generation smart card technologies will be integrated and tested. MPEG-4 compliant tools will be deployed in the trial in order to test some Intellectual Property Management & Protection (IPMP) methods. The analysis of the market and the available, but still not-assessed, technologies will lead to the trial technical specification and the definition of the TRADEX business case. Integration and fine tuning activities on the aforementioned technologies will create the trial, which will be strictly monitored and measured during its running. Assessment will give indicators of the technical performance and the business service impact. The agreement between Regional Government of Tuscany (Italy) and the Prefecture of Gifu (Japan), will be the building block to implement the international co-operation of TRADEX. For each type of participants, e.g. content providers, publishers, technology providers and institutional bodies; there will be representatives both from Europe and from Japan. Primary market and technological leaders are involved in TRADEX activities. Intense activity will be carried out for disseminating the project results.  Milestones: An analysis of the available technologies carried out. The business case as well as the trial technical requirements consolidated. The integration phase results in two versions of the testbed: 1. A TRADEX-THIN trial as small sized testbed as a result of the fine-tuning activities on the technological components; 2.

Private security companies (PSCs) are entities that exchange security services for financial gain; their activity is constantly increasing and is relevant under both the law of peace and war. The present research studies the criminal regulatory network currently in place for PSCs. The analysis focuses on the interconnected liabilities of PSCs as legal entities and their personnel. The regulatory network is inspected from the EU viewpoint, within the framework of international law. The EU regulation is analysed in the light of the common foreign and security policy as well as cooperation in justice and home affairs. At the national level, the regulation of EU member states is compared to the legslation of non-European countries. The international implications of the EU regulation are studied by taking into account customary and treaty law, both inside and outside international humanitarian law. The research aims to: (1) understand what criminal rules apply to PSCs and their personnel; (2) investigate the crimes likely to be committed by PSCs and their personnel, the subjective scope of criminal liability, exceptions to liability, criminal procedures and sanctions; (3) evaluate the coherence and completeness of the regulatory network and show possible reform perspectives.

The 20,000 SMEs operating here represent 94% of all manufacturers and formulators, contributing 157bn pa to European GVA. Following a major review, these SMEs are under increasing pressure to produce, in a sustainable manner, chemical products which are ecologically safe and of low risk to health. In particular, the imminent REACH legislation (Regulation, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals) seeks innovation in t he assessment and categorisation of all chemicals manufactured in Europe in terms of their toxicological and health impacts.  However, SME experience tends to revolve around traditional product lines and this group will experience difficulty and high costs in innovating their manufacturing in keeping with the new imperatives. Survival may be threatened, particularly in Speciality and Fines where a large grouping produces a multiplicity of products, all needing attention. Research will be focused here, on the Sustainability issues surrounding REACH. Green Chemistry alternatives will be introduced and innovative supply chain configurations developed around them, offering enhanced approaches to Sustainability.  A methodology will be developed to provide support t o SMEs in migrating towards REACH-compliant and Sustainable Futures. It will be the basis of an online, self-help Toolbox incorporating the research knowledge generated above.

It does so by focusing on CSOs that aim to improve citizenship rights and participation for groups often marginalized in the policy-making process, more precisely by studying the effects of internal EU administrative reorganisation on the participation of CSOs in EU decision- and policy-making. DemocInChange impacts on the future of European integration by contributing to President Juncker's political priority 'A Union of Democratic Change', making European societies more innovative, inclusive and reflective. It provides a better understanding of the linkages between equality CSOs and EU institutions, the impact of the Commission on CSOs networks and their lobbying options. DemocInChange pursues three objectives: 1) innovative interdisciplinary state-of-the-art research assessing how the EU can improve its decision-making, 2) excellent training equipping with innovative and future-oriented skills and a sustainable network allowing jobs in academia, policy think tanks or CSOs, 3) mutual learning between academics, policy makers, civil society and students by innovative ICT tools. The objectives will be achieved by a comprehensive training program providing excellent training-through-research, one academic secondment educating in innovative analytical software and elearning, and one non-academic secondment to the  European Parliament Think Tank. The three organizations provide fertile ground for disseminating research results to a variety of academic and non-academic audiences in short time.

The proposed research aims to start filling this gap by investigating the non-state justice systems operating in Berlin, the city with the largest Kurdish population in Europe, and Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-dominated city in Turkey. An evidence-based foundation is needed if the legal order and conceptualizations of citizenship are to be fit for increasingly diverse societies. In-depth interviews and participant observation will be used to investigate when, why and how Kurdish communities in Diyarbakır and Berlin choose alternative dispute resolution over the official court procedures provided by the state. There will be a special focus on family cases to examine how gender norms and relations are affected by the use of non-state judicial processes. A historical perspective on the Diyarbakir-based ‘unofficial’ legal order will explore the non-European and non-religious roots of unofficial dispute resolution practices used within Europe. The transnational perspective will also enable an investigation of the mutual influences across non-state and state legal orders in Europe and the Middle East. This interdisciplinary project aims to fill a significant gap in the relevant socio-legal, gender, migration, political academic studies and policy debates within the European Research Area. This proposed project will be hosted by SOAS University of London (Beneficiary) in partnership with Syracuse University (SU) (Partner Organization in TC), New York. There will be additional mobility to the the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Social Anthropology.",1,1
222,57167,No,Real-time data Helps Yielding Traffic Handling Models,"Video sensors for road traffic have proven advantages over loop detectors for various applications beyond the mere measurement of traffic variables, e.g. for incident detection. For the further deployment of traffic sensors, it is important to test their efficiency for specific surveillance and control tasks of practical importance, and to compare their performance with that of loop-based detectors. The use and full exploitation of video-based information calls for suitable modifications or even complete re-design of available loop-based surveillance or control algorithms along with field application, demonstration, and comparative evaluation. The innovation of RHYTHM lies exactly in this design and field evaluation of such algorithms while comparing results of both detection technologies, with the overall aim to improve quality of service. RHYTHM addresses 4 tasks complying with IST objectives: Surveillance (traffic state estimation/prediction, queue tail tracking & travel-time estimation/prediction) and Control (isolated traffic-responsive ramp metering). Innovation lies in the progress of quality of service: Video sensors have proven key benefits (spatial information, low traffic speed measurement, incident detection, cost-effectiveness) over inductive loop detectors. The main project effort is the design and field evaluation of algorithms while comparing results of both detection technologies. This approach leads to an open result; e.g. algorithms capable of taking input from different types of video sensors. I.  Work description: In order for the previously described objectives to be met, limited reviews on user needs and specifications will be conducted regarding the current stage of visual sensor deployment. Subsequently, based on the specifications of the tasks of surveillance and control considered, suitable algorithms will be designed to efficiently address the problems involved. Depending on each particular case, new algorithms will be developed or already existing ones will be modified, enhanced, or extended. After the off-line evaluation and comparison (using microscopic simulation) with results based on loop detector data, some selected algorithms will be implemented in the field. Field demonstration will follow. The German location for the test track is a 9 km stretch of dual carriageway which also has a hard shoulder, but with two parallel additional lanes bringing traffic in from the airport. Traffic volumes on the German test site are of around 70,000 veh/day. An independent third party will evaluate the results. At the end of the project, in the Final Report, recommendations will be provided regarding the trade-off of video versus loop-based data, taking into account both task efficiency and equipment and maintenance cost, along with various combinations of both types of sensors for specific tasks.  The work of RHYTHM is organized in the following workpackages: WP1. Project Management; WP2. Identification of User Needs; WP3. System Design; WP4. Off-line Evaluation; WP5. Field Implementation and Demonstration; WP6. Evaluation.  Milestones: D2.1 User Needs (PM7); D6.1 Evaluation Plan (PM12); D3.1 Algorithms for Traffic Surveillance and Isolated Ramp Metering Based on Visual Sensors (PM20); D4.1 Off-line Evaluation of Algorithms (PM26); D5.1 Field Implementation and Demonstration (PM30); D6.2 Evaluation Results (PM36).",0,0
849,220314,Yes,The Global Sites of International Criminal Justice,"JustSites studies the multitude of localities in which international criminal justice is produced, received and has impact. Building an innovative scientific vocabulary, the project understands these justice sites to be social topographies in which the political, legal and professional activities that collectively create international criminal justice are developed. The justice sites include locations in which forensic exhumations are carried out, NGO offices in conflict zones, foreign ministries, private law firms, media outlets, academic research centers, and the international criminal courts. These sites are closely related, and all depend on and compete with each other to define the direction of international criminal justice. With its analysis of justice sites, the project moves beyond the conventional focus on courts and their context to investigate instead the balances of authority and power that affect the relations between these topographies and thus drive the development of international criminal justice as a field of law. To investigate the relational topography of justice sites, the multidisciplinary project analyzes how these sites produce international criminal justice ideas and practices, and how such ideas and practices are received and have impact in other sites. By following the impact of ideas and practices as they move from one site to another, the relative and perceived authority and power of these sites will be identified and analyzed. Through their productive and receptive character, the justice sites also communicate the results of international criminal justice to broader audiences, labelling them in the process as a success or a failure. Therefore, contributing the first investigation of the topography of justice sites is not only of significant value as frontier research, but is crucial for understanding the wider societal, legal and political impact of this field of law.",1,1
236,105415,No,Market Selection and Aggregate Economic Outcomes,"Markets play the role of re-distributing resources. Which type of behaviors are rewarded by the exchange? Under which conditions are market capable of rewarding rational better informed agents or profit maximizing firms? Is agents and firms heterogeneity a persistent or transient property? Ultimately, what is the role of market selection in shaping aggregate economic outcomes?  Despite little is known on the issue, most of economic models rely on the Market Selection Hypothesis stating that non maximizing economic actors persistently loose wealth in favors of the maximizing ones. In the long-run the former are driven out of the market so that only the latter have an impact on the economy. However, a formal general proof of the selective capability of markets is still missing.  Aim of this project is to build upon the recent market selection literature, in particular, preliminary results about its possible failure, and recent techniques for the analysis of random dynamical systems in order to provide a definite check of the Market Selection Hypothesis, both in exchange and production economies. Moreover, we shall use the market selection approach to tackle some specific economic questions, such as the effect of financial innovations on financial markets stability, and the ensuing possible misallocations of resources in financing productive activities.  Our research has thus a positive content, namely the characterization of the outcome of market selection under the most general assumptions about agents behavior, and a normative one, namely how to use this knowledge to improve the effect of economic policies.",0,0
721,222661,No,Complicity: A Crisis of Participation in Testimonies of Totalitarianism in Contemporary German-language Literatures,"The aim of COMPLIT is to analyse the role of language in structures of complicity in humanitarian, political, ecological, moral and other wrongdoings that raise the question of what democratic participation means. The research project aims at interdisciplinary innovation, relating recent research in law and social sciences to testimonies of totalitarianism in contemporary German-language literatures by Herta Müller, Aglaja Veteranyi, and Elfriede Jelinek. The project expounds the comprehensive role of language in structures of participation and involvement, and highlights that the concern of testimonies of past totalitarianism is for the present: They outline modes of partaking in institutional violence that draws on heritage, culture, social, and gender distinctions still active in the globalized world of the present. The outlook onto the broader academic discussion and current societal problems strengthens the stance of humanities research by demonstrating its relevance to citizens at large. The scientific rationale of the project is a two-way knowledge transfer in the training-through-research of the applicant, who is an experienced researcher in the field of comparative literature with special regard to law and literature, and currently a research fellow at Yale University in the US. While transferring knowledge about an interdisciplinary, comparative approach to literature with a strong outlook onto societal challenges on highest international academic standards to the host institution, Universität Wien, the applicant will be reintegrated into the European research network. The COMPLIT project is of clear relevance to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions programme because it contributes to a better understanding of the current crisis in European integration and the backlashes onto democratic freedom by resentments and beliefs from Europe’s violent past in addressing structures of public discourses and institutions that foster antidemocratic, totalitarian notions.",1,0
732,43486,No,"Surveillance of cerebral palsy in Europe: prevalence rates in chilhood populations, trends over time and risk factors","Objectives: * to harmonize data collection on children with cerebral palsy, using a standard definition and an agreed minimum data set including perinatal risk factors for cerebral palsy.  * to compare birth cohort prevalence rates for cerebral palsy over time, between populations, and within subgroups (eg. low birthweight) and to examine the extent to which variations can be associated with differences in prevalence of risk factors.  * to provide protocols for future collaborative studies using the framework developed.  Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most commonly occurring disability in young children, making heavy demands on health, educational and social services. It occurs in 1 to 2 per 1000 live births, although in some high risk groups, such as babies born very early or very small, the rate may be as high as 80 per 1000live births. Both children and adults with CP draw on additional services which may range from specialised help at home or at school, to permanent residential care. In order to monitor trends and variations of rates of cerebral palsy, it is necessary for areas in different countries to collaborate. Variations in prevalence rate of cerebral palsy may be due to differences in definition of cerebral palsy, in the completeness of ascertainment and in the survival rate of low birth weight babies. Any remaining difference in prevalence between different populations, after standardising for these factors, may be associated with differences in obstetric and neonatal health care policies. The objective of this proposal is therefore to develop a framework, which will provide reliable estimates on cerebral palsy in children in Europe, on changing prevalence rates, particularly within birth weight groups. This project cannot be achieved at a national level due to the need of large amount of data for whom planned to analyse prevalence rates and trends overtime in subgroups of populations.  The first objective is to harmonise data collection on children with cerebral palsy, using a standard definition and an agreed minimum data set including perinatal risk factors for cerebral palsy. Prior to pooling or comparing data on children with CP across centres and countries, a standard system for describing children with CP needs to be agreed between paticipants, and information on mortality and potentially adverse perinatal events needs to be available in population. The population base which would be covered by the different participating centres will reach more than 250 000 live births per year, from nine different countries (DE, UK, NL, IT, FR, SE, DK, IE, CH) and 14different centres. Based on the experience gained, guidelines for inclusion/exclusion criteria, standard forms for describing children with CP, and guidelines for establishing and maintaining a cerebral palsy register as well as teaching courses might be proposed. A central common database will be compiled. It will then be possible to achieve the second objective, that is, to compare birth cohort prevalence rates for cerebral palsy over time, between populations, and within subgroups (e.g. Iow birth weight) and to examine the extent to which variations can be associated with differences in prevalence of risk factors. Many reports from different countries have shown an increase in CP prevalence during the last decades, which is especially due to the rise in CP prevalence in preterm despite increasing sophistication of obstetric and neonatal intensive care. It is therefore important to analyse birth-weight specific prevalence rates and to examine the relationship of these to birth weight specific mortality rates. Each centre will be asked to provide information about children with CP born since 1980. Reports of cerebral palsy rates in Europe, with a particular emphasis on rates of cerebral palsy among low birth weight babies (<1500g), are expected about come.  The third Objective will be to create a computerized register of CP research projects, using a systematic reviewing process to assess quality. In addition, protocols will be developed for future collaborative work using the framework developed. A register of CP research projects may provide details about research projects on CP children, and should lead to more efficient use of the limited resources available for research on this theme. At the same time it will be necessary to assess clinical and ethical requirements for developing collaborative studies. Then drawing up of protocols might be discussed within subgroups of interested centres, and consensus on protocols may be obtained at the end the three years of the project. Children with cerebral palsy impose heavy financial and emotional burdens on families. Research, which addresses the extent of the condition and improves our understanding of its underlying causes with the possibility of developing preventive strategies, will clearly be of benefit to affected individuals, to families as well as to society as a whole.",0,0

572,201266,No,Two-dimensional Uniform Gas with tunable interactions,"The overall idea behind this project is to study condensed matter physics and many-body effects via an ultra-cold gas of Potassium-39. In particular, this project aims to study the effect of interactions and gas homogeneity on the BKT transition. Studies of homogeneous gases are difficult to realize in the cold atom community where most ultra-cold samples are obtained in harmonic traps, which leads to a spatially varying density. However, recent work performed at the hosting institution on creating box potentials, led to the first realization of a 3D homogeneous BEC. The atoms are, in this case, surrounded by repulsive light and lie in a “dark” region of space leading to an uniform density. Such a system realizes the usual theoretical picture of a vanishing potential and is ideally suited to study phase transitions for which the inhomogeneity of the gas can blur or change the predicted effects. One of the most unique tools in the field of ultra-cold atoms is the ability to tune interactions. In this project, the algebraic decay of the gas coherence will be investigated for different interaction strengths. This project corresponds to the very philosophy of cold atom experiments which is to simulate quantum phenomena and to connect their extreme regimes leading to a better understanding of the overall phenomenon.",0,0
1022,222849,No,Bayesian Learning in the Infant Brain,"Infants come into the world equipped with amazingly powerful learning competences. The past decades have witnessed an ever-growing series of discoveries about young infants’ early cognitive achievements, illustrating these fast and unique adaptive abilities. However, the brain bases of learning mechanisms in the developing brain remain poorly understood. Meanwhile, in the past decade, the Bayesian brain has been put forward as a promising computational model accounting learning processes in the mature adult brain. In the present project, I propose to bring the two communities together and inspect the validity of the influential Bayesian brain hypothesis when learning processes are most crucially shaping the brain. Two assumptions derived from the Bayesian theory will challenged with studies conducted in young infants, using non-invasive behavioral and brain imaging techniques. In a first study, I will inspect whether the infant brain actively propagates predictions about upcoming events, as hypothesized in the Bayesian framework.  In a second study, I propose an integrated application of computational modeling, neural recordings and behavioral measurements to test a second assumption of the Bayesian brain which postulates that the brain continuously tracks and adjusts to the progressive discovery of regular patterns in the input. I will establish an international research network and rely on two hosts with distinct expertise to provide me with new skills. By bridging multiple levels of description, this research program will open up translational perspectives for the understanding of developmental processes and ultimately for the diagnosis of atypical development.",0,0

Two case studies: One East Palo Alto and San Francis of Assisi,"'GENIDMOV is based on studies of 'unlikely mobilizations' that are emerging increasingly in a context of global economic crisis and growing social inequality. It focuses on the empowerment process of minority groups (Blacks and Latinos) through their collective action, on the main processes and specific factors allow them to participate in public space. It covers a difficult research field, a barrio in North California (East Palo Alto), taken as a mirror of collective action for “low resources” people, which apparently combine all obstacles to mobilization. The objective of this research is to generate knowledge about obstacles and needs for opportunity enhancement for economic, social and political integration of minority groups and women in a life-course perspective, by examining the influence of the identities of gender, class, race, and of ethnic capital on the forms taken by collective action.It would allow to identify the critical issues in order to conduct appropriate policies of diversity and social equality in the future. Taking advantage of the diverse areas of expertise and of an another context for testing research hypothesis, the purpose is not to limit ourselves to the presentation of the social mechanisms of a phenomenon that affects a particular population, but to take this object of study as an entry feature for renewing the great questions of sociology and political science, such as various forms of social and political participation of individuals, the multiple modes of political socialization, the ways of the politicization of public causes and the elements that define a democratic society and social changes.'",1,1
578,39085,No,Working life changes and training of older workers,"From the points of view of education, training and learning among older (45\) workers the research project Older Workers and a Changing Working Life focuses on individual and organizational effects, needs and opportunities emanating from the intersection of two trends in society: The ageing of populations and changes in working life. The development and learning of old and young workers are studied within the context of work organisations. With this focus the issues of knowledge, skills, learning, values, attitudes and behaviour of the ageing workforce will be examined. Case studies of good practice in educational and training interventions in different work places will be evaluated.   The key objectives of the research project are:   1. To investigate the extent to which the knowledge, skills, experience, and attitudes of older workers can be recognised, valued and utilized in work and learning situations.   2. To investigate the ways in which older workers learn within work settings.  3. To investigate the extent to which human resource development practice and educational interventions involving older workers can facilitate lifelong learning and productivity.   4. To investigate the ways in which the diversity of the workforce in terms of age and acquisition of knowledge, skills, experience and attitudes can contribute to the development of learning organizations in the work context and, more generally, to the creation of the learning society.  5. To demonstrate through case study and comparative analysis of good practice in different countries the ways in which the above objectives can contribute to the flexibility and productivity of the European older workforce and to social cohesion generally.   To achieve these objectives, cases of work organizations representing different work types (industrial work, office work, service work) in small and larger SMEs will be selected in each participating country.

562,97289,No,"Language, cognition and landscape: understanding cross-cultural and individual variation in geographical ontology","This project will break new ground in the language sciences by pursuing a linguistic inquiry into landscape. From the linguist s point of view, the geophysical environment is virtually unexplored. Yet it has vast potential for influence on the discipline. The project will play a pioneering role in situating landscape within linguistics as a fundamental domain of representational systems, opening up important links to other disciplines concerned with landscape that usually have little to do with language. It will achieve this by (1) exploring landscape categorization in a number of languages, (2) comparing such categorization, (3) developing a model for understanding categorization across languages and speakers, and (4) documenting vanishing landscape systems. The research team will study landscape categorization in six diverse language settings. Each setting is a case study carried out by a team member with expert knowledge and prior field experience of the setting. Each setting offers opportunities of studying closely related languages as well as individuals speaking the same language, making comparison possible not only among maximally diverse languages but also at finer levels of linguistic granularity. An exploratory psycholinguistic subproject will probe the relationship between language and cognition in the landscape domain. The project will blaze a trail in applying GIS to linguistic data, in testing advanced experimental techniques in the field, and in documenting domain-specific data from a global language sample. Cross-cultural variation in landscape ontology is a matter of great practical importance understanding the meaning and reference of landscape terms and place names is crucial to major fields of human cooperation, from navigation to international law.",0,0
48,38952,Yes,Predicting the impact of policy-gender-auditing as a means of asses sing the probable impact of policy initiatives on women,"The objective of this proposal is to develop a concept of gender auditing that will form an integral part of the policy and law-making processes of the European Union and its Member States. Gender auditing is designed to measure the likely impact and effect on women of new policies and proposed legislation. In this manner the likely success of measures designed to eliminate social exclusion arising from gender can be assessed. In addition, however, other policies which are apparently gender-neutral can also be the subject of a gender audit since it is often these very policies which work to women's disadvantage and undo some or all of the good which social integration policies based on gender may have done. The notion of assessing at a preliminary stage the likely social impact of proposed actions is not a novel one since a type of impact audit is already used at Community level in respect of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and development projects (environmental impact assessment).   PIP is a research network comprised of institutions from five member states where expertise exists in undertaking research into law and gender. The project will capitalise upon this expertise into order to develop a database of mechanisms currently used to address women's concerns and experiences in the law and policy-making frameworks of particular states.  Existing gender impact assessment mechanisms will be identified and factors will be isolated which have led to their success, or lack of it. Part of the process of evaluating the success or failure of particular mechanisms will be the use of case studies. Case studies will enable the research team to pinpoint why gender impact assessment mechanisms which in theory look very suited to their task, fail. The possible reasons for failure might be related to the structure of the gender impact assessment mechanism. It may, for example, simply be an advisory body whose opinion carries little or no weight or it may not possess the data to allow it to comment meaningfully on whether a particular measure may be damaging to women. Alternatively a mechanism may work well but other considerations such as politics or finance may mean that law or policy-makers are prepared to ignore its recommendations or modify them dramatically.   Once mechanisms have been identified and their effectiveness assessed, the project will single out criteria for the development of a model of policy/law-making in which the likely impact of Community/national policies on men and women is an integral part - a gender audit. In this manner the Community and Member States will gain from knowing the likely impact of their actions on women and can plan accordingly. In their turn women will move closer to achieving substantive as opposed to formal equality.",1,1

20,108412,Yes,Normative Interaction and Law-Making: Regulating Migration in the Maghreb,"This project explores law-making in the domain of migration in the Maghreb as a result of interaction between diverse exogenous and endogenous normative factors. It builds and tests an innovative approach to reforms undertaken since 2003 in three countries, namely Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania, to improve the knowledge and understanding of legal development in the Maghreb. It unfolds the plurality of interactions that result in the law being reformed in these countries and the country-specificity of law-making in a field where law is being globalised. Drawing on comparative law, international law, sociology of law, human geography and political science, the project examines how recent regulations affecting migration (entry and stay in a territory, exit from the territory, citizenship and asylum) have been thought, elaborated and adopted in each of the three Maghreb countries covered by the project. It therefore goes into the details and mechanisms of law-making and leads to designing a comparative model of normative interactions in national law-making. This project provides an unprecedented analysis of legal development in the Maghreb and a valuable contribution to the understanding of normative interactions in the field of migration. Innovative from theoretical, empirical and methodological perspectives, it develops a coherent analytical framework of law-making, aimed to be replicable across policy and geographical areas. It is hosted in a research centre at Aix-Marseille University, France, which combines excellence in legal research and a unique multidisciplinary academic pool rooted in the Mediterranean. It resorts to field research in Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania and a network of partners in these countries to benefit from local input and favour knowledge-sharing.

This will allow the comprehensive analysis of genetic factors in this disease, and should open many possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. A bank of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II transfectants is also being constituted.  T-cell biology: Various groups have reported on clinical trials performed with CD4 antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The newest development concerns administration of a monoclonal murine antibody chimerised with a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) constant region. The antibody appears to be well tolerated and to induce T-cell cytopenia to various degrees. Another approach, very successful in animal models, is therapeutic T-cell vaccination.  Triggering and target antigens: Research suggests that synoviocytes might incorporate and process antigens, thus clearing them very efficiently. This clearance activity would be impaired following adjuvant immunisation and would allow overexpression of autoantigens in the joints in the early stages of adjuvant arthritis. Another group working in this research area has produced direct evidence of cross reactivity between the human protein lactoferrin and the 65 kilodalton heat shock protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M leprae.

The future development of an operational system, already identified in the current roadmaps, requires advanced R&D work on 4 critical technologies: - Combustion chamber. - High endurance nozzle. - Catalytic injector. - Production, storage and use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.  These R&D activities structure 4 main work packages. A system study ensures the global vision in coherence with an economic analysis, the identification of technical challenges and the consolidation of scientific results. A last work package performs the dissemination of results. An innovative aspect is the fact that the R&D activities are directly driven by the ecvolution of market needs and system requirements. Main expected benefits are: - Green and simpler design (compared to bi-liquid). - Shorter transfer time and reduced cost of operations (compared to EP)  A TRL 3-4 level is expected at the end of the project. The impact of the project is secured by the composition of the consortium led by Astrium with the main European actors of the hybrid: it contributes to the consolidation of the European industrial supply chain for Hybrid propulsion.

370,13741,No,GENE CLONING OF BRUCELLA ANTIGEN WHICH AS VACCINES DO NOT INTERFERE WITH A SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS,"THIS RESEARCH MIGHT PERMITS TO DESIGN VACCINES AGAINST BRUCELLOSIS WHICH COULD BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM NATURAL INFECTION. IT SHOULD THEN BE POSSIBLE TO VACCINATE CATTLE AGAINST BRUCELLOSIS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY TO STAMP-OUT THE INFECTED CATTLE. PRESENTLY, THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.  Research was carried out in order to develop a vaccine for brucellosis which includes only the major protective antigens and is devoid of specific antigens useful for the diagnosis. For vaccine development, it was necessary to define more precisely which antigens, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and/or major outer membrane proteins (OMP), are essential to induce valuable protection. For diagnosis, antigens were looked for that could be used in conjuction with A2. Brucella OMPs are extremely difficult to purify by classical techniques; therefore, genes were cloned using an expression vector. Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) specific to potential antigens were produced and used to passively immunize mice. The immune response of infected animals was studied by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of Brucella antigens, immunoblotting techniques and inhibition enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Results of passive immunization of mice showed that both A antigens and M antigens of the LPS are essential for protection, whereas OMPs are only weakly protective. The role of these OMPs at the cellular level will be further clarified by using recombinant proteins. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences of both genes were nearly determined and gene expression is under investigation. Mabs specific to 10, 16.5, 19, 25 to 27, 36 to 38, 39, 89, kDa proteins were obtained. Results of Mab binding to Brucella cells indicate that all except the 39 kDa one are OMPs; it is cytoplasmic. After purification by preparative electrophoresis and intradermal injection into infected guinea pigs, the 39 kDa protein induced a strong delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. The 10, 16.5, 19 and 89 kDa proteins were immunogenic in goats and cattle. A2 antigen was purified and Mab directed against this antigen are now being produced. 89 kDa OMPs were also purified by preparative electrophoresis. DIAGNOSIS OF BRUCELLOSIS IS BASED ON THE SEROLOGICAL DETECTION OF SPECIFIC AGGLUTININS; UNFORTUNATELY, THE VACCINATION AGAINST DISEASE INDUCE ALSO THE SAME AGGLUTININS, AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW IF AN ANIMAL HAS BEEN VACCINATED OR INFECTED. THIS COULD BE OVERCOME BY USING A  VACCINE CONTAINING THE MAJOR  ANTIGENS INDUCING PROTECTION, AND DEVOID OF A LEAST ONE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN ALWAYS PRESENT IN THESE BACTERIA.   THE RESEARCH WILL INCLUDE :     - PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE MAJOR ANTIGENS.   - PREPARATION OF DNA FROM BRUCELLA.   - CONSTRUCTION OF GENOMIC BRUCELLA LIBRARIES IN E.

522,209012,No,A cultural history of comparative art practices and receptions in Cold War Europe (1945-1991),"Cold War studies tend to emphasize dual narratives, mostly investigated as actions that are dictated from above by State policies or as cultural relations in an international context. Starting from my previous studies on bilateral art relations in the second half of 20th century, the project is intended as a comparative survey within a polycentric and inclusive European focus area, including the two German republics, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and Italy. The main study cases will be provided by multilateral art encounters and the involved locations and actors, analysed as individual and collective art practices. Unique Cold War art archives and collections at the Getty Research Institute and at the Wende Museum in Los Angeles will provide key resources. In order to assess the impact of the art practices on culture and society, I intend to investigate both their critical reception in the professional art world and their popular response through the commentaries left by exhibition visitors. A crucial question is whether the European dimension has ever been considered as a common ground - be it of political, social, artistic or speculative nature - for multilateral art practices within the divided continent. Particular attention will be paid to unmet expectations and missed connections among the interested art communities. By including current Member and Associate States and Third Countries, the research is meant to contribute to inter-European comprehension and integration, as an essential premise in order to “inform the reflection about present problems and help to find solutions for shaping Europe's future”, as stated in the Work programme 2016-2017 of Horizon 2020. The project is conceived as a multidisciplinary research which, through training and inter-sectoral mobility in Comparative Studies, History and Art History, will have a ground-breaking impact on my future career prospects in the academic and non-academic sectors as Comparative European Art Historian.",1,0
171,93913,Yes,THE DEBATE BETWEEN ISLAM AND THE WEST IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Perceptions of Eastern scholars about modern European civilization—is not well documented. The subject has been a growing field, especially in the US, during the last decade but critical groundwork is not yet complete. Thus, it is still difficult to assess the attitudes of early modern Muslim intellectuals and statesmen toward modern Western civilization, and specifically its sciences and technology, in any comprehensive way. “The Debate between Islam and the West in Science and Technology” (“DEBIWIST”) project will address these lacunae in the following ways: First, it will document the changing perceptions of European civilization held by native intellectuals in Turkey and Egypt between 1850 and 1950. Its focus will be considerations of Western sciences and technology, and Middle Eastern justifications for acceptance or rejection based on religious grounds. The study will concentrate on major thinkers from different sectors (religious and lay, and traditional and European-style educated thinkers or scholars) of each society. The second objective is to contribute in-depth and scholarly information and analyses to current debates about the compatibility of Islam and European civilizations. It will do this by examining case studies from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Here, research will analyze data from Egypt and Turkey that counters the “Clash of Civilizations” arguments presented in Samuel Huntington’s 1993 article and emphasizes the cooperation between Islam and Europe on a deeper academic level. The third objective is to contribute to and expand the area studies within the European context. Although European scholars established the precedents in Islamic studies, American universities have taken the lead in research and publication in Middle Eastern studies. This project will identify and aggregate researchers at Bilkent with a long-term goal of establishing a Middle Eastern studies concentration.",1,1
780,225971,No,Expanding our knowledge on Citizen Science through analytics and analysis,"The Call focuses on Citizen Science (CS), understanding it in a comprehensive way and inviting projects to deepen and broaden our knowledge on CS activities and their impact. Indeed, overcoming present hurdles on the way to reach that knowledge will enable the potential benefits of CS – on individual citizens, organizations, and society at large – to be realized more effectively and frequently. This is the aim of our proposed project, CS-Track, which will seek this increased knowledge by “observing” a large and diverse set of CS activities, gathering data from the web, interviews of involved players, etc., and from a more direct inspection of running activities. Vast amounts of data will thus be studied, relying for this on (1) web-based analytics, i.e. the use of computational analyses to study CS activities based on their manifestations and traces on the web and social media, and (2) deepening and combining these analyses with approaches known from social studies through multi-perspective analysis and triangulation. Our data analytics and analysis will target both “own” aspects and developments of the CS activities (organizational/operational characteristics, scientific outcomes, good practices, individual/group learning, other success or failure indicators, etc.), and societal aspects, related to the impact of those activities on society,  such as gender, age, geographical and socio-economic differences; science as a discipline and its role in society, changing attitudes to science, women in science, etc. This will enable us to understand complex processes, disseminate good practices and formulate knowledge-based policy recommendations intended to optimize CS to make it a major, positive factor for EU’s society and economy.

Edible mushrooms will be submitted to accelerate solvent extraction (ASE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to obtain (T1) polysaccharides (b-glucans), (T2) statin-like or other metabolites and (T3) ergosterol-derivatives concentrates. These concentrates and their mixtures (T1\T2\T3 in a meat-based food matrix) will be screened for their properties to act as (I) and (II). All samples will be submitted to in vitro digestion and absorption tests (using Caco2 cell models) to study their bioavailability and molecular mechanism of action.

50,94003,Yes,Towards a “Topography” of Tolerance and Equal Respect. A comparative study of policies for the distribution of public spaces in culturally diverse societies,"Tolerance has been increasingly invoked as the inspiring ideal of a number of social policies in European democracies. Appeals to tolerance have animated especially the political debates on those policies addressed to accommodate minorities’ requests. Among such requests those for the allocation of public spaces have recently acquired pride of place in the political agendas of many European and extra-European countries (e.g. the allocation of space for Roma sites; Muslims’ requests to build places of worship and housing policies for migrants). Despite such a generalized political and societal relevance of the notion of tolerance, some problems may occur when policies inspired by it are implemented. In particular, the implementation of tolerance-inspired spatial policies may result in the marginalisation of differences and thus risk undermining social cohesion. What conception of tolerance may be invoked to limit such a risk? To answer this question, we shall test the hypothesis that grounding tolerance on equal respect for persons may contribute to the development of spatial policies capable of resolving the tensions between tolerance and social cohesion in culturally diverse societies. In particular, the project pursues 4 objectives:1.to develop a conceptual taxonomy to clarify the liaisons between tolerance, respect and spatial issues;2.to study the ways in which appeals to tolerance have informed the development of spatial policies;3.to investigate the influence of cultural diversities on the interpretations of tolerance in different national contexts;4.to extrapolate from the above studies an overall view of the connections between tolerance and equal respect. Our findings will be of interests to national and international Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), policy makers at a European, national, regional and municipal level and international academics engaged in the study of urban integration in different social, religious, cultural, and political contexts.",1,1

The total consumer expenditure per year is calculated in 9.596.363.000€ in Europe. This represents an average of 192€ per runner per year. RunIN solves the actual problem that sporty people and vendors face when looking for information, tickets/products/ equipment or consumers respectively as there is no site of reference and it is all scattered today.. RunIN connects and integrates different vertical services related to running, biking and triathlon through a unique, usable, social and friendly ecosystem that allows monetizing this huge market since consumers easily find what they look for and vendors can also reach consumers. RunIN will disrupt the existing sports sector by changing the current business paradigm taking into account new opportunities arising from having an unique “Sport Identity” and stimulating under one single platform a more collaborative and social interaction between the different stakeholders and consumers. This innovation is made possible thanks to Big Data, Mining, Machine Learning and Business Intelligence techniques. The information and set of services that revolve around the social layer of the ecosystem is the niche market that RunIN aims to capitalize. With the right functionalities, athletes and companies start interacting within the RunIN ecosystem, which allows to monetize both B2B and B2C opportunities.

266,3882,No,Use of diagnosis related groups to support hospital sector management in the European Community,"The objectives of the project were:   1) To identify areas of DRGs work where it would be beneficial and feasible to increase the level of standardization and to take steps to promote and implement such standardization.  2) To develop and encourage adoption and use of standards in the annotation of DRG statistical publications, so that opportunities will be taken to compare and aggregate statistics across EC countries; and conversely, so that the risks of invalid comparisons might be reduced.  3) To describe recent and current activities in the area of DRGs in EC countries within a common scientific framework and with sufficient technical detail, so that all countries might benefit from the experience of others.  4) To describe plans and needs for future DRG work, and hence to promote the exchange of ideas that might beneficially influence planning decisions at the level of individual EC countries.  The use of case mix measures has extensively contributed to the knowledge of hospital performance. The spread of diagnosis related groups (DRG) in Europe offers new possibilities for research in this field. The EURODRG project has examined the opportunities for getting comparable DRG hospital statistics in Europe and has produced an overview of DRG used in Europe. Factors introducing difficulties for comparability have been analyzed and agreement on recommendations among experts has been reached. Comparisons of DRG hospital databases from 6 countries have been produced and important differences in length of stay (LOS) for high volume, well defined DRGs have been found, both among countries and among hospitals within countries. Measurement of the hospital product has been a field of research of significant strategic importance in improving the efficiency of health services. The use of Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) had spread in various European countries during the past decade, offering new possibilities for obtaining information and for comparing hospital operations, at both national and international levels.

191,108807,Yes,Preventing Abuse of Children in the Context of AIDS  in sub-Saharan Africa,"To date, 12 million children have been orphaned by AIDS, and 70 million more live with AIDS-affected caregivers within sub-Saharan Africa. Our programme of research has demonstrated heightened levels of physical, sexual and emotional abuse amongst children in AIDS-affected families. Despite increasing calls for intervention studies addressing child abuse in the developing world (UN 2008; WHO 2010) no interventions or research have yet targeted this high-risk group of AIDS-affected children. This project will develop and test, using a randomised controlled trial design, an evidence-based intervention to prevent and reduce child abuse within AIDS-affected families in South Africa.  The study takes an innovative approach, incorporating a tripartite collaborative process between scientists, policy-makers, and civil society, thus maximising cultural applicability and sustainability. The randomised controlled trial includes 1600 adult and child participants, with wait-list controls and 1-year post-test evaluation in a real-world setting. The research has the key aims of 1) Testing theoretical frameworks of causation and prevention of child abuse in the developing world; 2) Testing the efficacy of an intervention for reducing child abuse; (3) Examining potential intervention moderators and mediators; (4) Testing the feasibility of the intervention when implemented by community volunteers at a low cost; (5) Disseminating results within sub-Saharan Africa to inform policy and programming.  This study capitalises on the PI’s position as a scientific advisor to Southern African governments and international NGOs, on the expertise of a senior advisory group of academics and policy-makers, and on an established research team.

317,209251,No,Christian-Muslim families dealing with religious pluralism in everyday family lifeReligious reconstruction in religiously mixed marriages,"Mixed families are both the index and agent of social change: they exemplify the increase in migration flows and provide us with an opportunity to analyse the everyday processes related to Europe’s growing pluralism. Quantitative studies demonstrate that interfaith marriages lead to higher divorce rates, suggesting that the latter are due to communication difficulties and disagreements caused by cultural differences between partners, as well as to hostility from families of origin, religious institutions and society at large. However, rather than being firmly and empirically established, these concepts remain mere assumptions and, as such, also conceal the ways in which those involved actively and reflexively deal with these dynamics to prevent damage to their relationship. Much scholarly attention has focused  on couples defined as Islamic-Catholic or Muslim-Christian, which represent a paradigmatic case study of “mixedness” that typically incorporates differences pertaining to ethnicity, class and faith. The challenge of this project gives an empirically adequate exploration of a pattern firmly established in quantitative studies, i.e., that interfaith marriages give rise to high divorce rates. This project thus aims to understand, through an in-depth qualitative study, the daily life of such families: what differences are responsible for tension between spouses, how they deal with this in order to avoid damage to their relationship, and how gender interferes with these problems. Mixed marriages will be a key to examine the whole of society facing new family changes, Islam and religious diversity in everyday life.

They are characterised in quantitative terms using statistical methods and it is increasingly recognised that many common human diseases such as cardiovascular disea se, cancer, psychiatric illness, autoimmune and inflammatory disease fall into this category. Susceptibility to prevalent infections, or to disease following infection (in humans, domesticated and wild animals) can be so described as can most of the traits of greatest interest in evolutionary biology such as fitness, viability, and reproductive success. The development of genomic technology in recent years has had an immense impact on all areas of genetics and evolutionary biology. The theory describing t he fate of genes in populations was reformulated; there is increasing recognition that linkage between genes, and disequilibrium which arises in populations between linked genes is important. Genetic mapping and genome sequencing programmes of human, mouse and other organisms have generated many markers for mapping genes influencing complex traits in human populations as well as those of wild animals and model organisms.

This cross-national study of the state-socialist project of gender equality will apply interdisciplinary research methods including oral history, institutional ethnography, textual analysis and archival work to: 1.) destabilize existing paradigm of understanding the relationship between state socialism and post-state socialist gender relationships in terms of disruption and discontinuity, 2.) reconceptualize the notion of women’s agency under state socialism by recognizing socialist states as site for development of supranational women’s agenda, before Beijing Conference in 1995, 3.) deliver more comprehensive understanding of state socialist “gender equality” by recognizing the role that local political and cultural forces, religion and nationalism played in shaping and altering state socialist project of gender equality in various locations.",1,0
1045,214512,No,Towards a Digital Critical Edition of The Works of Giuseppe Verdi,"Critical editions of 19th-century Italian opera have been appearing in print for over four decades, offering the basis for productions in major European theatres, as well as for audio and video recording with world leading singers, which continue to engage millions of people today. Established in 1983, _The Works of Giuseppe Verdi_ (University of Chicago Press and Ricordi) aims to publish all of Verdi’s music in a critical edition, relying on the rigorous criteria developed by its Editorial Board, but the traditional printed book format of this edition presents several practical limitations for users: in particular, it does not allow for simultaneous visualisation of alternative materials and for fruition of alternative versions of the score, and it precludes addition of newly available source materials to existing volumes.       DiCrEd is a multidisciplinary project aiming to address these limitations through the integration of the innovative instruments offered by digital humanities into _The Works of Giuseppe Verdi_, under the supervision of its general editor, Prof. Francesco Izzo (University of Southampton). DiCrEd employs the digital tools designed by the Edirom project (University of Paderborn) to develop 1) an applied model of digital critical edition with 2) an interactive system of fruition of the score, and 3) an applied model of digital critical edition of preparatory materials (sketches and drafts). The project uses Giuseppe Verdi’s French version of _Macbeth_ (1865) as a case study, making its full score commercially available for the first time. The project bears the potential to mark a turning point in the fields of musicology and textual criticism, with the long-term prospect of introducing digital instruments into the standard toolkit of the publishing industry related to 19th-century Italian opera.",0,0
275,83842,No,Structured illumination in optical Tomography,"Optical imaging techniques and probe development have boosted knowledge on genomics and proteomics. High quality imaging techniques and novel sources of contrast are being developed, however 3D information and more importantly quantification is still lacking especially at a resolution higher than that provided by confocal microscopy. It is now high time to develop more elaborate approaches that will improve resolution, sensitivity and specificity of real-time in-vivo imaging of gene expression and biological processes in 3D.  We propose to develop a novel microscopy technique based on tomographic approaches for 3D in-vivo imaging of biological processes. Optical tomography provides isotropic optical resolution in all three dimensions of space; this resolution is however limited by diffraction to about 250nm for visible light. To overcome this impasse, structured illumination will be implemented, thus improving the resolution drastically compared to conventional microscopy techniques. By making use of saturate d patterned fluorescence excitation, the resolution barrier can be overcome altogether.  This technique will be applied to imaging structure and dynamics at the cell nuclear level. Subsequently its potential has to be tested in the analysis of complex systems such as the drosophila melanogaster. To that end, a custom-made microscope will be extended for structured and saturated fluorescence excitation, and corresponding inverse mapping algorithms will be developed to reconstruct the objects or the fluorescence dye distribution respectively from the 3D images. This new optical imaging device will then be used to quantitatively study nuclear and sub-cellular structure, organisation and dynamics in 3D.",0,0
397,193424,No,"Cross-sectorial real-time sensing, advanced control and optimisation of batch processes saving energy and raw materials","In many aspects batch processes are superior to continuous. Therefore it is worthwhile to take advantage of recent progress in sensor technologies, modelling and automation to develop a new paradigm for the design and conduction of batch processes: a) operation at maximum efficiency, b) dynamic, quality driven process trajectories rather than fixed schedules c) detailed analysis and tracking of all relevant process and product parameter. The main objective of the proposed project is the maximization of efficiency (reg. quality, energy, raw materials, and costs) of batch processes.  Integrated process control is essential for an efficient operation of industrial batch processes: it tracks the evolution of product properties, detects deviations from the target values for product quality and derives corrective actions at a stage when an automatic compensation of deviations from an optimal trajectory is still possible.

936,102583,No,Banking on new antimicrobials: translational fidelity impairment,"'Infectious diseases represent an incessant threat for the human population worldwide. The rapid evolution and flexible metabolism of bacterial pathogens have caused a staggering global rise in antibiotic resistance. Our project aims to contribute to the pressing need for discovery of new antibacterial targets. The project will combine the applicant`s expertise in molecular biology and biochemistry, together with the competence of the host lab in infection biology, bioinformatics and high-through-put methods, to evaluate potential targets for new antimicrobials development. Protein biosynthesis accuracy is an integral part of the living cell health. Errors during translation of genetic information into proteins may lead to nonfunctional and toxic product formation. We propose to evaluate frameshifting, the most severe type of translational inaccuracy, in a systematic and quantitative fashion as means to defeat bacterial pathogens. Our preliminary data show that it is possible to invoke avirulence by targeting frameshifting control in the pathogen Salmonella. To reach our objective, we have developed a fluorescence-based tool to monitor translational mistakes in vitro and in vivo using flow cytometry. We will collaborate with core facilities to use proteomics and gene expression profiling to decipher downstream effects of mistranslation. The results will be validated in the murine model of typhoid fever. These data will be used to create an in silico model for Salmonella that, fed by genomic information of other bacterial pathogens, could predict potential broad-spectrum drug targets. The academic benefit of the project involves promotion of an interdisciplinary approach and mutual exchange of state-of-the-art methodology between the host lab and the researcher. The researcher will enhance her individual competences as an independent investigator, master cutting-edge techniques, and strengthen her tutor skills within proposed out-reach activities.'",0,0

Fostering innovative entrepreneurship with public funding and public guidance for entrepreneurs contributes to a thriving economy and to the reduction of unemployment rate. All four consortium partners are responsible for designing and delivering entrepreneurial support in their regions. There are highly experienced and less experienced partners in this project proposal. By following the twinning advanced methodology all entrepreneurial activities of the partner organisations and their experiences will be shared in a structured way following the 4\1 Phase Model which is successfully applied by the MEVINO partner KOMPASS since years. The Model and the guidebook provide the theoretical and scientific foundation in terms of knowledge, competency and skills, needed by a Business Advisor in start-up consultation. Peer reviews of the current entrepreneurial support services provided by the partner organisations and the peer learning process with elaboration of the joint Design Options Paper with individual improvement measures for the 4 partner organisations will follow the 4\1 Phase Model. The project will gather the activities, approaches, Good Practices depending on partners’ post experiences in different applications of their entrepreneur support activities in the MEVINO GP pool where all partners can find something to import and implement in their own region.

The project will demonstrate its feasibility through a prototype containing a meaningful sample of all the different types of documents to build a global system for search and retrieval. It is based on the assumption that in libraries, archives and museums an enormous number of descriptions could be made available over the Internet by converting existing records or by creating new ones to specific SGML/XML DTD's.  OBJECTIVES COVAX intends to combine document descriptions from libraries, museums and archives, with digitized surrogates of their materials, in order to build a global system for search and retrieval. It will allow the widely distributed primary documents from these cultural institutions to be accessed regardless of their location. The basic operational core is the application of SGML and the various DTDs currently being defined in libraries (MARC DTD), archives (EAD) and museums (MUS-EAD), as well as the DTD defined by the Text Encoding Initiative for the mark-up of electronic versions of cultural texts. The use of SGML/XML will enable standardization, interoperability and interconectivity between libraries, archives and museum in the processes of handling, browsing, searching and retrieval of all kinds of descriptions and documents. The application of XML will allow a standard distribution of primary sources through Internet and will provide more widespread access to all citizens Worldwide.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The following technical activities are planned: - Requirements analysis - definition of Covax network nodes, information systems and standards used, volume of information to integrate; identification of other issues affecting performance and scalability; definition of initial set of information assets for the first prototype. - From this and the state of the art, definition of standards to use to integrate all the information (XML DTDs, etc.) and of the system functionalities for the users involved. - Elaboration of the technical design of the system covering the system architecture, assigning responsibilities to system components and devise ways to integrate them and make them collaborate for achieving the system functionalities.  Technical development will be in iterative phases consisting each of: development of components and interfaces via detailed technical design, coding and testing in the development site; implementation of the results and validation / assessment of the system's usability, to include user feedback for the next iteration. Parallel activities to the technical ones above are: - exploitation planning; dissemination of the project concept and results in applicable communities, so that the exploitation and the project results themselves can benefit from it; concentration with other projects.",0,0
636,102560,No,Physically unclonable functions found in standard PC components,"Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are used to uniquely identify electronic components and to protect valuable objects against counterfeiting. They allow creating a root of trust in a hardware system through generating device-unique 'fingerprints' and deriving secret keys from the underlying physical properties of the silicon. Today they are typically found in specially designed hardware components and result from the silicon properties of individual transistors. They exist in many forms, among which are the so-called SRAM PUFs.<br/>This project intends to study and show the existence of SRAM PUFs and other types of PUFs in standard PCs, laptops, mobile phones and consumer electronics. This has not been attempted so far. The mere existence of physical properties that depend on a component and are reproducible is only the first step to guarantee appropriate robustness, reliability and randomness properties for use as secret keys or trust anchors in mass-market applications. By uncovering the security properties of PUFs in standard components such as graphical processing units, central processing units and PCI connectors, this project will provide the first intrinsic and long-wanted basis for security in everyone's most common computing platforms: standard PCs and similar hardware. This new root of trust in turn adds security for mass-market applications, replacing or complementing the role of a trusted platform module and enabling security for applications such as broadcast applications, content protection for the gaming industry and secure day-to-day transactions for everyone. The results of the project will allow for the first time an a priori open platform, the most difficult element to secure in an information-technology system today, to inherit security properties from its own identity and its intrinsic physical properties.",0,0
7,209472,Yes,Electoral Legacies of War: Political Competition in Postwar Southeast Europe,"We know remarkably little about the impact of war on political competition in postwar societies in spite of the fact that postwar elections have garnered tremendous interest from researchers in a variety of fields. That interest, however, has been limited to establishing the relationship between electoral democratization and the incidence of conflict. Voters’ and parties’ electoral behaviour after the immediate post‐conflict period have remained largely neglected by researchers. The proposed project will fill this gap in our understanding of electoral legacies of war by analysing the evolution of political competition over the course of more than two decades in the six postwar states of Southeast Europe: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Organised around three thematic areas/levels of analysis – voters, parties, communities – the project will lead to a series of important contributions. Through a combination of public opinion research, oral histories, and the innovative method of matching of individual census entries, the project will answer to which extent postwar elections are decided by voters’ experiences and perceptions of the ended conflict, as opposed to their considerations of the parties’ peacetime economic platforms and performance in office. In-depth study of party documents and platforms, party relations with the organisations of the postwar civil sector, as well as interviews with party officials and activists will shed light on the influence of war on electoral strategies, policy preferences, and recruitment methods of postwar political parties. And a combination of large-N research on the level of the region’s municipalities and a set of paired comparisons of several communities in the different postwar communities in the region will help expose the mechanisms through which war becomes embedded into postwar political competition and thus continues to exert its influence even decades after the violence has ended.",1,1

It is based upon the premise that information technologies profoundly affect the socio-political-economic structures of the societies adopting them, and that these structures in turn affect which kinds of technologies are developed and how they are used. To analyse further this reciprocal causation between social structure and information technology, we propose to study the dynamics of innovation and to discover and explain scaling phenomena for corporate structures and urban systems. The results of our research will be integrated into both a comprehensive vision of the 'information society' and a set of policy-relevant suggestions for European participation in this society.

The results of our research will be integrated into both a comprehensive vision of the 'information society' and a set of policy-relevant suggestions for European participation in this society.  OBJECTIVES The proposed research is designed to develop a theory and methodology by means of which we may achieve a deeper understanding of what 'information society' means and how socio-political-economic structure is related to the ways in which new information, communication and control technologies are generated and used. To carry out this task, we propose to establish an interdisciplinary team of social and physical scientists, engineers, mathematicians, statisticians and computer scientists. The team will initiate research on a new, complexity-based agenda in social science, featuring a dynamic theory of innovation and an account of the emergence of scaling laws in corporate structure and urban systems; it will develop tools to implement this agenda in order to gain new understanding about our current information society; and it will apply this understanding to analyses of possible paths of social-technological development in the future.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The innovation subproject will have three components: theory development, modelling, and a detailed case study. The theory will describe the structure of agent-artifact space and will analyze the cognitive, constructive and stabilizing processes through which invention and innovation transform this structure. Two agent-based modelling environments will be developed: one for innovation processes, which will be used to investigate different modalities of cooperation among competing agents participating in the construction of new marketing systems; the other for investigating the interrelation among communication and decision processes with different inherent time scales, which will be applied to problems of information contagion, organization design, and market processes. The case study will test the adequacy of the theory to structure a narrative and provide new insight into the emergence of a distributed control network market system. The scaling law subproject will have two components. The first will search for scaling laws in corporate structure, the second in urban systems. They will be based in part on a recently developed theory of biological organization that relies on optimality in hierarchical branching networks. The tasks involved include finding the right set of variables that exhibit scaling and the model the dynamics that produce empirically observed scaling relationships. Both components will include substantial empirical analyses, based on the one hand on a large corporate database constructed by McKinsey Associates, the other on data for urban settlements in SW France assembled in the context of another European Research Project, as well as new data sets for all of Europe. At the end of the projects, the researchers and consultants will search for policy relevant suggestions based upon the research carried out.   MILESTONES",0,0
215,93929,No,Innate Neuronal Circuits,"Animals exhibit behavioral repertoires that are often innate and result in stereotyped sexual and social responses to their environment. Sexual behaviors represent a robust set of innate responses. Genetic studies in Drosophila strongly imply the FruM, a male-specific isoform of the fruitless gene in programming male courtship. The circuit of female behavior on the other has been largely uncharacterized. Here I propose to identify and characterize the neurons involved in female receptivity. I will follow two independent yet complementary approaches: 1) I will use a laser guided neuronal tracing procedure together with electrophysiology to follow to higher order neurons the circuit for sensing the male pheromone cisvaccenyl acetate. cisvaccenyl acetate sensing has common properties at the sensory level in males and females yet it generates different behaviors; 2) I will perform a behavioral screen of lines of flies with different subsets of neurons inhibited for their activity. Once I identify the lines that have a behavioral effect, I will characterize the anatomy, function and connectivity of the subsets of neurons marked in the selected lines. This will be facilitated by the fact these lines allow access to genetic manipulation specifically in the defined subsets of neurons. With this work I expect to contribute to a comprehensive view of the circuits for female sexual behavior. It will allow to determine how much commonality is there between the male and female brain and more importantly to identify general neuronal architectures that guide behavior.",0,0
689,210106,No,GNSS for mass-market Internet-of-Things tracking applications,"Our project intends to foster Internet-of-Things tracking applications by delivering a breakthrough GNSS-based sensing technology that is low-power and low-cost. GNSS are historically designed for autonomous positioning, such as car navigation systems and imply high battery needs for the receivers. Observing that tracking applications do not require the asset to know its own position, but rather the application itself, our innovation introduces a new system approach for small battery-powered electronic devices using low-power wireless connectivity. With our solution, they can only sense the GNSS signals, and the position is computed in a cloud-based server, whereby power consumption is not an issue. By offering a 10X decrease in power consumption compared to state-of-the-art technologies and matching with IoT networks constraints, our technology meets the crucial requirements in terms of power consumption, costs, and services in order to address the most significant opportunities in the assets (pallets, trailers, livestock…) and personal (people, belongings, pets...) tracking markets. Delivered as geolocation cloud services, the solution under development will enable the tracking system providers to tackle mass-markets needs on top of which: - For professional use-cases: Insuring Return-on-Investment by achieving a cost-effective tracker that lasts as long as the object without replacing cells. - For consumer use-cases: Managing end-user acceptance by reaching a compact design while showcasing sufficient autonomy. The feasibility assessment will focus on the economic viability and on the necessary steps for a successful go-to-market strategy. While this project covers world-wide challenges in different verticals (logistics, manufacturing, agriculture, consumers), Europe is at the heart of our developments because: 1) Europe is currently the de facto cradle of IoT wireless networks 2) It will contribute to make Galileo the default option for IoT tracking applications",0,0

1076,80600,No,Close Communications for Cooperation between Cybercars,"This research proposal is driven by our vision that, in the not too distant future, Cybernetic Transport Systems (CTS) based on fully automated urban vehicles will be seen on city roads. Such systems have been developed and evaluated in the scope of the CyberCars and CyberMove projects of the 5th FWP and are now being deployed.  However, these present CTS can only operate in low demand environments where little interaction between vehicles is anticipated. In order for this system to address high demands, more cooperation between vehicles is needed. This is the topic of this proposal, based on vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communications and vehicles coordination. We will address in particular the cooperation between vehicles running at close range (platooning) and at intersections (merging, crossing). We will also explore, how regular vehicles equipped with Advanced Drivers Assistance Systems (ADAS) can benefit from close range communications and become, in some limited environments, fully automatic vehicles (dual-mode).  One of the objectives of the project is to develop a communication architecture for the long term which is interoperable and fully compliant with existing or soon to exist standards such as the CALM architecture.

These components must be free of export control. A newly available European origin innovative reprogrammable FPGA architecture has been assessed by Atmel and approved by the two main European Primes EADS Astrium and Thales Alenia Space. This technology will be also used for market segment dealing with harsh environment: Avionics, Transport and - Energy. Dynamic partial reconfiguration has been successfully experienced on Xilinx Virtex 4 and 5 families, and tested on Atmel AT280 architecture but where limited by the architecture and tool constraints of existing software.

1004,203201,No,Feasibility Study to Demonstrate Effectiveness and Efficiency of Enamel Remineralisation using Reminova's EAER (Electrically Accelerated Enhanced Remineralisation) Technology for Dental Applications,"'Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most common communicable disease, globally affecting 36% of the adult population. It has been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a major global public health crisis (2008) and costs the European economy an estimated at €60Bn.  Reminova is developing technology that 'regrows' enamel, replacing the need for dental anaesthesia and drilling in the treatment of caries. The novel approach requires the delivery of three formulations to the tooth using a tiny (unperceivable) electric current in a process known as Electrically Accelerated Enhanced  Remineralisation (EAER). This will be used to treat caries in-office without the need for tooth tissue removal. Our development has been welcomed by both end consumers and the dentistry sector and there is a strong market pull to get our technology to market. Patients want a painless solution that maintains and repairs their teeth, so they may retain them throughout their lifetime. Dentists are keen to embrace a shift to preventative and curative dentistry as opposed to the current reparative approach used when drilling and filling teeth. To achieve market success it is anticipated the device should control rapid remineralisation of precavitated lesions within existing timeframes and treatment pathways.  This Phase 1 H2020 award would be used to undertake initial feasibility work and planning on how we can optimise remineralisation to a 15 minute time-frame. We believe that this is critical to the commercial viability and scalability of an identified €1.7–4.4Bn global market in the first 3 years of market entry for the device. The core activities of our phase 1 project would be initial feasibility work on techniques for optimisation and building a suitable approach and methodology for a subsequent phase 2 application. This will be essential to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology to meet customer needs and validate market claims, thus achieving commercial success. '",0,0

574,102746,No,Combined Model-based Analysis and Testing of Embedded Systems,"One of the most important strategic sectors in which Europe is developing, integrating and delivering high-quality products is the transportation domain. Here, high-class safety-related products as e.g. airplanes, cars and trains have a huge market impact. More and more of the market value of these vehicles is gained by embedded systems inside these products, and the number and importance of these embedded systems is steadily growing. One of the most important enablers to assure the quality of embedded systems is the application of powerful validation and verification (V&V) technologies accompanying the embedded systems development process. Unfortunately, the V&V technologies already in industrial use are still too expensive while often not effective enough. MBAT will provide European industry with a new leading-edge V&V technology in form of a Reference Technology Platform (MBAT RTP) that will enable the production of high-quality and safe embedded systems at reduced cost in terms of time and money. This will be made possible by a new and very promising approach in which model-based testing technologies will be combined with static analysis techniques. Besides this combination, a further new approach is to use (and re-use) specially designed test & analysis models as basis for model-based V&V. This advanced model-based V&V technology will lead to a more effective and at the same time cost-reducing approach compared to traditional ones. In addition, MBAT RTP will be connected to other ARTEMIS RTPs to extend existing platforms. Developed by industrial key players (large companies and SMEs) in this domain and supported by leading research partners, the MBAT RTP will be of high value for the European industry, providing very effective means to assure utmost quality embedded systems at reduced costs.

25,109765,Yes,"International Protection of Human Rights as a Constitutional Issue: Promises, Problems and Prospects","International law is distinguished from other branches of law by the fact that States as its principal subjects are not only the addressees of law, but also creators of legal rules and guarantors of their enforcement. The idea of international constitutionalism attempts to place some constraints on the power exercised by States. Human rights form today a core of any Western constitutional order. However, the role of international human rights within international constitutionalism is articulated only rudimentarily. The project aims at filling this gap by analyzing current discourses on international constitutionalism and human rights in literature and jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice through an interdisciplinary and critical lens. Theoretically sound, practice- and policy- oriented  proposals as to the more adequate articulation of the relationship between human rights and international constitutionalism will be formulated. In order to fulfill the aims of the project methodological tool developed in history, philosophy and sociology will be used. In order to seek new avenues for a more adequate fulfillment of human rights’ promise of protection the project will seek inspiration in non-western (Islamic law) and extra-legal (ancient Greece) normative orders. Through funding of research the grant will support successful integration of a promising academic into European research community and her establishment as a leading specialist in the field of human rights. It will also promote establishment of a research team and widening of the international network of the researcher.  The Grant will thus contribute to the growing excellence of European research community and establishment of lasting collaboration with extra-European academic institutions.",1,1
152,84703,Yes,"Resources, rights and capabilities; in search of social foundations for Europe","The promotion of individual and collective capabilities underpins CAPRIGHT's research on the relations between labour markets, employment and welfare regimes. This agenda creates a positive dynamic between social justice and eomic efficiency, the vital foundations for a knowledge eomy. The important priority is to allow every person, where ever she lives and works, to develop her own future with the resources that are available to her. What possibilities are open to her? What effective freedom of choice does she possess? What obstacles impede her plans? What forms of public action, subject to what types of public debate, are available to overcome these restrictions? How can public policy overcome inequalities of capabilities? What political procedures can Europe employ to push Member states in the direction of such change? CAPRIGHT integrates two approaches into one process: one addresses resource regimes, the other inequalities in capabilities, developed from the work of Amartya Sen. This involves disciplines of anthropology, eomics, history, law, political science and philosophy, sociology. CAPRIGHT will create a critical mass of empirical research in three key areas: gender equality, professional development and work restructuring. It will tribute to the creation, on several levels, of public spaces within which processes of deliberative social democracy can address these issues. Each area is analysed from three entry points, offering empirical evidence ?from the bottom up? within a WP: the actual trajectories of people?s working live; situated public action; social dialogue and European policy development. To ensure a unified approach, from the hypotheses to the clusions, the work is framed on the one hand by theoretical work and on the other by the elucidation of the political agenda.

809,24945,Yes,Sexual behaviour and risks of HIV infection,"The EC Concerted Action on Sexual Behaviour and Risks of HIV Infection focuses on two complementary aims: a) making cross-national analyses of sexual behaviour and attitudes towards HIV risk based on data from general population surveys in several European countries, b) exploring new conceptual perspectives for understanding sexual behaviour and risk taking.  The rapid spread of AIDS over the past ten years showed the need for a better understanding of sexual behaviour and attitudes toward risk, and the lack of research in this field. During this period, many studies have been completed in Europe, as in many other parts of the world, and have provided useful information for prevention and epidemiological forecasting. Comparing and contrasting empirical findings, methodologies and conceptual frameworks is useful in validating findings, avoiding duplication, and assisting in the adoption of reliable instruments. In Europe, several initiatives were taken to give the researchers the opportunity to meet and cooperate. An important role was played by the Social and Behavioral Research Unit of GPA/WHO and within some European concerted actions including Assessing AIDS prevention coordinated by the Institut de medecine sociale et preventive of Lausanne.   The Concerted Action on Sexual Behaviour and Risks of HIV infection takes place in this context of growing international cooperation and will be completed at the end of 1994. Its goal is to contribute to the development of a European scientific community which studies sexual behaviour and attitudes toward the risk of HIV infection. Considering past and ongoing projects, two objectives were formulated:   a) Making cross-national analyses of sexual behaviour throughout Europe from the perspective of HIV risk.   Researchers are now comparing and contrasting cross-national sexual behaviour studies. They will write a report that includes a basic description of behaviours and attitudes towards HIV risk in Europe, methodological issues related to conducting sexual behaviour surveys, recommendations for further research, and policy implications of the findings.   b) Exploring new conceptual perspectives for understanding sexual behaviour and attitudes to HIV risk.   Different conceptual approaches to why individuals engage in safe or unsafe sex is being explored. The emphasis is on frameworks that elaborate the importance of social and relational determinants of sexual behaviour. Basic assumptions and operationalizations of key factors are discussed. Researchers will note the ability of different frameworks to explain perceived risk of HIV/AIDS and sexual behaviour, and they will suggest their relevance for creating and improving HIV prevention programs.",1,1
253,92882,No,Reinforcing the networking of FP7 National Contact Points (NCP) and third country contacts in the Euratom Fission Programme,"Research and technology development in the area of nuclear fission and radiation protection – under the Euratom programme – is booming. However, there is a clear need for better coordination of research activities at a European and global level – in order to further stimulate innovation and improve the EU’s competitiveness worldwide. Hence, a well-organised and proficient network of National Contact Points for the Euratom programme is essential to improve this coordination.  Project NUCL-EU is a 51months project and has the overall objective to create an efficient, pro-active and sustainable network for stimulating closer cooperation among all the National Contact Points and Third Countries contacts for the Euratom Programme. NUCL-EU has two clear specific objectives: the reinforcement of the Euratom NCP network and the enhancement of Third Countries participation. Principal activities include good practice benchmarking with Euratom NCPs, followed by tailor-made training sessions and twinning schemes for new and less experienced NCPs. Third Countries contacts will be encouraged to participate in all NUCL-EU activities. Participation of research organisations especially from Third Countries in Euratom will be boosted through a large Brokerage Event. The expected impacts of NUCL-EU will be 1) a strong and uniform Euratom NCP network, involving sound communication with Third Countries, and 2) more effective participation of Third Countries to the Euratom programme. Moreover, good practices of this network will be publicly available as a handbook for NCPs in other FP7 themes.  The coordinator (APRE) will invite all Euratom NCPs, including those outside the consortium, to the project activities.

107,220306,Yes,JIHAD OR RE-INTEGRATION: PATHWAYS OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS AFTER WAR,"Foreign fighters pose a serious threat to Europe. Western intelligence agencies believe that approximately 400 foreign fighters have returned to the EU from Syria and Iraq,  and that at least 250 radicalized individuals have been smuggled to Europe from 2014 until 2016.  The major hotbeds of foreign fighters smuggling and recruitment are located in Europe itself, in Bosnia and Kosovo, both of which underwent civil wars that featured foreign fighters. We know little about how foreign fighters behave in the aftermath of such civil wars: why some continue fighting in other wars while others go back to civilian life. This is an unfortunate shortcoming because numerous studies have shown that some foreign fighters have demobilized in the aftermath of wars in Afghanistan and Bosnia, while others left for Chechnya, Iraq and Syria to continue jihad. Those who continued fighting built networks with terrorists who are responsible for recent attacks in Europe. It is, therefore, imperative to understand these dynamics in order to make sound decisions that can prevent terrorism in Europe. This project will remedy this shortcoming by pursuing three goals. First, the project will adopt a fresh theoretical framework for the study of foreign fighters. Drawing on organizational theory, career transition and political violence literature, the project aims to explain post-war pathways of foreign fighters as a function of their role in previous war(s). Such an approach goes beyond standard focus on motivations and will help elicit why foreign fighters demobilize or turn violent in a long-term perspective. Second, the project will obtain new empirical insights into how foreign fighters pursued different paths in two similar, post-conflict contexts (Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo). The third objective of the project is to develop a set of policy recommendations that will assist future policy makers in dealing with returning foreign fighters.",1,1
493,224282,No,FarmConners - Paving the Way for Wind Farm Control in Industry,"The FarmConners project supports the implementation and industrialisation of Wind Farm Control (WFC) as an additional feature for the development and operation of wind power plants. It brings together actors in all relevant fields connected with the market uptake of WFC: research institutes, industry and certification agencies. FarmConners will coordinate a reliable assessment of the WFC possibilities, promising more green power from existing and upcoming assets for the price of a software update.   WFC technology brings a collaborative approach to wind power plant design and operation, mitigating the losses due to turbine-turbine interaction within the plant. Accordingly, it promises an increase in power production and a decrease in structural loads while providing better integration of wind power in the grid. Additionally, it enables better revenue management, especially for the upcoming flexible electricity markets, making wind power “market fit”, which in turn decreases the project cost and increases the share of the leading green power source. FarmConners will provide a unique platform for the marketability of this feature; bringing the state-of-the-art achievements, ongoing projects and industrial interest together to remove barriers for commercial implementation of WFC.",0,0
1064,45770,No,Towards recycling friendly adhesive products for the paper chain (EURO-STICKIES),"In co-operation with the participating institutes (PTS, CTP and PIRA) a classification system has been elaborated to assess the recycle-friendliness of the adhesives. Based on the testing of selected adhesives (commercial products - typical representatives of their grade classes) for their sticky potential both in laboratory and pilot tests, basic requirements on the behaviour of adhesives in paper recycling operations were formulated.  For adhesives to be recycling-friendly they should meet the following criteria: - high shear resistance of the adhesive film in the pulping process to ensure minimal fragmentation; - completely separable by screening (cleaning and flotation); - non-redispersible (no generation of microstickies and secondary stickies).  Based on these results the participating adhesive producers developed new adhesives or modified some of their products with a view to enhancing the separability of adhesives in recovered paper treatment plants. The types of adhesives produced and studied were weighted to reflect the composi-tion of the Consortium. Compared to packaging and bookbinding adhesives, priority was given to pressure sensitive adhesives.  The newly designed adhesives coming within the product categories of pressure sensitive adhesives and packaging adhesives (based on polyvinyl acetate dispersions) were compared with commonly used commercial products in terms of their recyclability. This comparison indicates that targeted product development in the adhesives area has in fact substantially reduced the disturbing potential of the adhesives during recovered paper treatment and in paper production processes. This may be concluded from both lab-scale tests and in near-practical pilot tests. Additionally, both adhesive sup-pliers and paper converters have evaluated the newly formulated adhesives for their convertibility, functionality and cost. The majority of the new adhesives tested during the project and rated as recy-cle-friendly can be considered an initial basis for marketable industrial products. In some cases, their future use may be restricted to special applications for reasons of performance or cost. The project has further demonstrated that the classification scheme elaborated to assess the recycle-friendliness of the adhesives is a useful approach. Lab-scale studies of the adhesives for recyclability which, in the case of favourable results, were followed by pilot-scale studies gave the combined benefits of low-cost laboratory investigations plus field orientation. The combined lab and pilot-scale tests enable a systematic approach to meaningful, detailed and practically relevant evaluations of the disturbing potential of different adhesives during papermaking. Accordingly, the behaviour of the adhesives in industrial treatment plant of recycle mills may be predicted. Over the past decade recycled fibre has become the dominant raw material of the European paper industry. Striving to achieve a further increase in waste paper inputs, mill managers are using waste paper furnishes for higher-grade papers, too. This strategy is, however, restrained by non-paper components entering the manufacturing process together with waste papers. As a result of increasing circuit closures that are being implemented for economic and ecological reasons, accumulating contaminants of this kind tend to cause production failures, which lead to productivity and quality losses. In modern mills the so-called stickies have become the most critical problem recently. Conventional screening systems can only remove stickies of particle size ranges that fit the available mesh sizes, but even if the stickies have the right size the screening result is still dependent on efficiency values. This project is aimed at studying a selection of commercial adhesives and coating binders for evaluation of their sticky forming potential and sticky sizes.  For simplicity, the collective term 'adhesive products' will be used for both adhesives and coating binders in the following. Based on the project findings, criteria will be elaborated which allow recycle friendly adhesive products to be developed. The stickies formed by products of this kind are expected to be separable from recycled furnishes by screening and fractionation or else to leave the paper manufacturing process undisturbed. The project will be handled in steps as follows: - Evaluation of representative products, latest know-how and State-of-the-Art - Selection and establishment of test methods for macrostickies, microstickies and secondary stickies - Establishment of basic test parameters and treatment conditions - Lab- and pilot-scale testing of products for their sticky potential - Assessment of critical adhesives and systems - Formulation of experimental recycling-oriented products and testing of their tendency to form stickies - Final assessment of adhesives BE97-4903",0,0
623,82191,No,Dynamically defined fractals with overlapping constructions,"Since the seventies there has been a growing interest in different branches of the sciences (including physics, chemistry, biology, finance, etc.) about a new phenomenon called 'fractals'. As a result of this, since the mid-eighties mathematicians have been investigating the structure of fractal sets. The simplest fractals are the so called self similar ones. These are fractals which are unions of their own similar copies (I.e., scaled down versions of the original). These similar copies (so called cylinders) may be pair wise disjoint. This is the easy case, which has been well understood since mid eighties. However, there may be significant overlapping between the cylinders. This latter case is much more problematic to analyse. The first result in hand ling this more difficult case was due to Falconer 1988. Inspired by that work, M. Pollicott and K. Simon (the host and the researcher of this project, respectively) worked out a method which is nowadays called applying the 'transversality conditions. In f act, this is the only known method to give a good understanding of a typical member of a one parameter family of fractals of overlapping construction.. The aim of our project is to develop new and more effective tools to handle fractals arising from such overlapping constructions. Such fractals naturally occur in many important physical models. To achieve this aim we investigate four major cases: The Hausdorff dimension of the fat Sierpinski triangle, The Fourier transform of self-similar measures for an overlapping construction, IFS which are contracting on average, Fractals of overlapping construction used in fractal image recognition. These problems are explained in detail in the 'Project objectives'. To solve any of these specific problems will require the invention of new methods. These new techniques can then subsequently be applied in the general case to give a better understanding of all fractals arising from overlapping constructions.",0,0
1025,75704,No,Towards a Lifelong Learning Society in Europe: The Contribution of the Education System,"In contemporary Europe lifelong learning is identified as the mean to retain economic competitiveness but also achieve social cohesion. Despite the consensus about the centrality and desirability of lifelong learning the concept has a wide range of meanings. Formal systems for its delivery are diverse and vary at national and regional levels and for particular social groups. For the implementation of Lisbon strategy comparative research on the manifestations of lifelong learning policies and practices and relevant individual experiences are needed at European, national and local level. The project focuses on the contribution of the education systems to the process of making lifelong learning a reality and its role as an agency of social integration. We will carry out a joint research agenda to understand better the tensions between the knowledge-based society, lifelong learning and social inclusion in the context of enlargement of the EU and globalisation; provide an empirically based analysis of lifelong learning policies in Europe and their implications for different social groups; develop relevant policy proposals for lifelong learning strategies to decrease social exclusion on the European and national level and identify their implications to relevant areas of social and economic policies. Within the project empirical studies will be carried out with regard to macro, meso and micro levels in order to take into account macro-structural factors and national policies as well as institutional factors and actors' motivation and actions. Analyses will be based a survey of adult learners in schools and universities and data from Adult Education Survey; interviews with schools' management and officials from education ministries; interviews with SME management. The project will integrate into a coherent picture different aspects - historical, political, institutional, economic, individual and methodological - related to participation in and access to lifelong learning.",1,0
1021,197001,No,Q-Room – Quintetto’s Holographic Telepresence Room,"Telepresence? With holographic telepresence it becomes reality. A new system, just showcased in Italy, that allows interaction between physically distant individuals, in a realistic and natural way. The project directed by IT Company Quintetto, in cooperation with the Italian Research Council (CNR), opens interesting possibilities of application in areas where real and direct interaction between users is important. These scenarios are certainly the banking and public offices world, where telepresence could revolutionize contacts, changing the way of delivering services from the traditional, physical branch to a new, virtual one. Telepresence can become a tool to improve the territorial coverage of banks, providing essential services to citizens in an economic, organizational model. For the first time, this system brings a very realistic, 3D interaction to the market, at an affordable cost, simply using an ordinary internet connection. The user has the perception of being seated in front of a real operator who guides him through the process simply and quickly, from product selection to contract signing by physical printing of the document. This is just an example of how technological innovation can radically transform the user experience, shaping services based on evolving needs and expectations. In order to bring the product to the later stage of development to hit the market, Quintetto would like to assess the commercial feasibility of the Q-Room. The objective of the Phase 1 of the innovation project is a business plan outlining the economic strategy: market analysis of the state of the art in the eligible market and an investigation of main competitors will accomplish the feasibility report. The business plan will also define a successful marketing and commercial strategy. The company will be assisted by specialized consultants to carry out an accurate IPR study aimed at identifying the state of the art in its own field.",0,0
369,218600,No,Constructing Age for Young Readers,"Constructing Age for Young Readers (CAFYR)  CAFYR starts from the observations that Europe has recently witnessed a few pertinent crises in intergenerational tension, that age norms and ageism frequently go unchecked and that they are part of children’s socialization. It aims at developing pioneering research for understanding how age is constructed in cultural products. CAFYR focuses on fiction for young readers as a discourse that often naturalizes age norms as part of an engaging story and that is endorsed in educational contexts for contributing to children’s literacy, social and cultural development. The effect of three factors on the construction of age in children’s books is studied: the age of the author, the age of the intended reader, and the age of the real reader.  CAFYR aims to lay bare whether and how the age and aging process of children’s authors affect their construction of the life stages in their works. It will show how various crosswriters shape the stages in life differently for young and adult readers. It considers the age of young readers as varied in its own right, and investigates how age is constructed differently for children of different ages, from preschoolers to adolescents. Finally, it brings together readers of various stages in the life course in a reception study that will help understand how real readers construct age, during the reading process and in dialogue with each other. CAFYR also aims to break new theoretical and methodological ground. It offers an interdisciplinary approach that enriches children’s literature research with concepts and theories from age studies. It combines close reading strategies with distant reading and tools developed for digital text analysis. It provides a platform to people of different stages in life, contributing to their awareness about age, and facilitating and investigating dialogues about age, with the aim of ultimately fostering them more.",0,0
781,83443,No,Work harder and have more babies? A political-economic analysis of the care economy: old-age provision,"The object of the present research project is the crisis of the welfare state with a focus on old-age provision. This crisis is viewed as being essentially a manifestation of two shocks: the exogenous shock is the restructuring of the global economy; the endogenous shock derives from the family which has provoked the problem of demographic ageing since this is nothing less than low fertility rates. Second, women's changed role has provoked the problem of redistribution of paid and unpaid work in the economy. Since enhanced female employment rates mean that the household's traditional caring capacities are being eroded. These trends affect the contribution-based social benefits such as retirement benefits. The challenge of ageing population puts into question the maintaining of adequate and sustainable pensions.  The political commitment to an enhanced labour market participation of women at the European level seems to engender a contradictory imperative at the individual level: to work harder in order to secure (private) provision for one's old age and, simultaneously, to have more children who will be able to sustain the public pension schemes once they are grown up. The interdisciplinary research proposal combines an economic analysis of changes that have taken place on the (world) market in the context of globalisation with an analysis, conducted from a political science perspective, of the reform of the welfare state and social change. Not that old age insurance should be regarded and tackled in isolation.  The effect of a pension policy and its reform is closely intertwined with fiscal and labour market policy. However, the sum total of societal welfare derives from inputs of three institutions: State, market and family. Women's role in non-market-based welfare production is essential. The aim is to make a contribution to a new economic theory framework including a comprehensive gendered analysis of welfare state reform.",1,0
30,106372,Yes,Building Academic Freedom And Democracy In Africa,"This Fellowship’s purpose is a comparative assessment of the protection for, and health of, academic freedom in the African nations, currently a vastly under-researched field, and a subsequent analysis of most relevant best practice for the protection of academic freedom in the EU, which can then aid the derivation of an African model of the concept, which will be disseminated across, and embedded within, universities in Africa. To achieve this, the project will unite the Fellow, who has a wide knowledge of academic freedom and human rights issues in Africa, with the Researcher in Charge, who has experience and expertise in assessing the protection of academic freedom in different states, to produce together new knowledge which will be disseminated across both Africa and the EU. The long-term effect of this research will be to substantially increase the institutional collaboration between universities in Africa and the European Union, enabling greater protection of academic freedom via the joint development of governance structures, processes and protocols. Additionally, through the mobility to the EU of a leading African human rights researcher, the project will facilitate aid and encourage greater teaching links and research collaboration, and academic and scientific outputs between the universities in the two continents. The main academic subject areas which relate to academic freedom are higher education policy and international law. However, by promoting greater collaboration at institutional, rather than subject, level this project will generate greater intercontinental collaboration across a wide range of academic disciplines, via increases in the number of EU-African university collaborations.",1,1
960,37040,No,Cost effective solar silicon technology,"Objectives   The manufacturing companies who produce silicon wafers for PV use with ingot technologies, such as Directional Solidification (DS) and Czochralski (CZ) pulling, have a strong need for technical innovations with the aim to reduce manufacturing costs and to increase production volumes, yields, process stability and wafer quality for more efficient solar energy conversion.  This project is a common research effort by the European industries and specifically refers to the introduction of new innovative technologies for realizing crystalline silicon substrates. Its aim is to decrease the present production cost of photovoltaic silicon wafers by approximately 45%. The consortium includes Bayer, Eurosolare and Siemens, who are the most important European industrial PV silicon material producers.  Technical Approach   Research approach and methodologies:  1. A more rational management of the raw material: Studies will be carried out to establish the effect of compensation on the conversion efficiency of solar cells manufactured on substrates originated from mixtures of p-type and n-type electron grade (EG) silicon scraps and recycled production silicon.  2. Crystal Growth: The current Si crystal growth procedures employ DS and CZ technologies. For DS technology the goal is to improve the duty of the furnace by introducing a new technology based on variable thermal insulation during the different steps of the thermal cycle.  For CZ technology the goals are to increase the pulling rate by growing multi-grain crystalline structures (3-grain crystals) and to improve the material performance by heat treatments during and after the growth cycle.  3. Wafering technology: An automatic system for wafering, cleaning and collecting silicon wafers must be set up in order to produce thin (< 250 um) and large (> 225 cm2) wafers with a production yield > 95%.  4. Post-growth wafer treatments: These treatments are particu-larly suitable for multi-crystalline wafers. The goal is to recover wafers affected by impurity contamination by industrial POCl3 gettering and hydrogen passivation processes.   Expected Achievements and Exploitation   Reduction of the cost of active PV material will lead to a lower cost of the PV installed power. Partners involved in the fabrication of substrates will become more competitive. In particular this can be achieved by a wider use of existing silicon feedstock, improving the material quality by a better design and implementation of the crystal growth process and by introducing post-growth treatments, in analogy with the EG silicon process. Partners involved in solar cells and module fabrication will benefit from improved material performance and cost for final products. Crucible and equipment manufacturers will be able to supply higher quality products to the market. Results of the project are intended to be used at first between the partners and, subsequently, on the market.",0,0
113,192055,Yes,Origins and Effects of Normative Commitments,"A debate in the development of legal institutions is whether individuals obey the law because the law incentivizes or because the law has legitimacy.  Much of the PI’s research in law and in development seeks to understand how people form normative commitments, i.e., what people view as the moral and right thing to do, and how they respond to these normative commitments.  His work traces the incentives that lead to human rights violations.  The PI has examined how interpretations of religious and legal texts, particularly those associated with fundamentalism, interact with market forces.  In two multi-part studies, the PI investigated the economic forces underlying the religious provision of social insurance, social sanctions, social conservatism, and the economic incentives that give rise to gender violence, sexual harassment, and regulation of the private domain.  Through these investigations, the PI formulated a theory for why church-state separation arose in some countries but not in others, developed a methodology for empirically evaluating the effects of normative commitments, and used a particular instance of interpretive injustice where capital cases in the British Army during World War I were randomly executed or commuted, in order to estimate the deterrent and delegitimizing effects of the death penalty. The proposed project builds on this previous work. The proposal rests on 2 pillars: Normative Commitments in Health Care and Normative Commitments in Courts.  Within these 2 pillars, the PI studies the effects of market forces on normative commitments and examines how normative commitments come into existence in the first place.  (1) Normative Commitments in Health Care: The PI will measure the influence of pharmaceutical company payments to physicians on their normative commitments. This pillar will evaluate the effects of payments on physician prescriptions and patient outcomes. The pillar will examine whether disclosure laws affect the relationship between payments, prescriptions, and patient outcomes. The pillar will employ a unique U.S. dataset on over 2 billion prescription claims per year on up to 177 million individuals and a Danish database of all prescription drugs sold linked to prescribers with pharmaceutical associations. (2) Normative Commitments in Courts: This pillar will use the random assignment of judges in common law courts to measure the impact of exogenous changes in legal precedent. The pillar will apply a method co-developed by the PI for two-stage least squares estimation (Econometrica (80(6), 2369-2429, 2012) that exploits judicial characteristics as instrumental variables. The pillar will study the effects of 24 legal areas, including capital punishment, free speech, gay rights, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and rights of the disabled.  The pillar will use this data to study the origin of rights.",1,1
182,101112,Yes,Democratic Responsiveness in Comparative Perspective: How Do Democratic Governments Respond to Different Expressions of Public Opinion?,"To what extent are democratic governments responsive to citizens’ demands and preferences between elections? Are governments more likely to be responsive to the interpretation of public opinion through surveys or to collective and publicly expressed opinion –generally in the form of protests? When does one ore the other type of expression prevail as a mechanism to foster governmental responsiveness? What happens when both forms of expression of the public mood are in clear contradiction? Are certain institutional and political configurations more likely to make governments more responsive to citizens’ views between elections? Are certain political configurations more conducive to governments paying attention to opinion polls while others make them more receptive to collective action claims-making? This project will answer these questions by developing a comparative study of of governmental responsiveness in established democracies between 1980 and 2010. To this purpose, we will discuss the relevant definitions of ‘governmental responsiveness’ and ‘public opinion’, and analyse data from various sources: (i) public opinion surveys, (ii) datasets with information on protest events, (iii) news reports on public moods, collective action, and governmental activity and decision-making, and (iv) comparative indicators on institutional attributes of democratic systems. In terms of the research strategy, the project will combine the analysis of a large number of cases (20 established democracies) with a more detailed study of a set of up to 7 cases. This study will provide a highly innovative approach to the representative link between citizens and governments by comparing the dynamics of democratic representation in decision-making junctures in the periods between elections for which governments cannot invoke an electoral mandate, with the dynamics that emerge in ‘normal’ policy-making situations. The project lies at the intersection of political science and sociology.",1,1
74,41687,Yes,Models of immigrant incorporation in Europe harmonizing national ideas of citizenship and immigration policy within the European Union,"The interlinked questions of immigration policy, asylum, citizenship rights and anti-discrimination law are all currently high on the European agenda. I propose a two-year project to chart and understand the simultaneously cooperative and conflictual political processes taking place about these questions at the national inter-governmental and Commission levels. The aim of the research would be to investigate and uncover the mechanisms driving cooperation on these matters within European fora, or those hampering their development at the national level. Very different models of immigrant incorporation can be found across West European nation states, and agreement on common European policies and formulae is often at the mercy of national party political preoccupations. Despite this, a developing institutional logic in the sphere of legal and administrative cooperation is nevertheless beginning to produce some movement towards the EU's stated goals of harmonizing and extending European institutional provisions. In order to further pursue these goals, Policy makers thus need a better knowledge of the dynamics of achieving cooperative outcomes in this field. This offers a strong reason for a more political science 'policy process' approach to the subject to supplement the predominantly legal studies about citizenship and anti-discrimination law that have so far taken place.  This research would locate itself in the on-going research projects of ERCOMER, which is the ideal base for a comparative, inter-disciplinary European study of this kind. The work would aim to be of direct relevance to current policy discussions and proposals within different arms of the EU concerning immigration and asylum policy, racism and xenophobia, and European citizenship.",1,1
877,96883,No,Dynamic Molecular Nanostructures,"The ITN DYNAMOL will establish a powerful new approach for the preparation of nanostructures based on dynamic covalent chemistry. This approach combines the advantages of covalent synthesis (robustness of bonds) with those of non-covalent synthesis (error correction, responsiveness) without any of the disadvantages. It therefore has the potential to provide unique solutions for several important challenges in the preparation of nanostructures that still need to be addressed. The ITN unites most European leading academic experts in the area of dynamic covalent chemistry with partners from the industrial sector. Expertise of all partners encompasses the areas of supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry, but individual research competences are quite diverse focussing on molecularly defined nanostructures, analysis of nanostructures, and novel applications. The complementarity and diversity thus realised is crucial for successful research and training in this area. Moreover, the two full partners from the private sector, both representing small and medium-sized enterprises, and the two associated partners, one a major chemical company, will have the critical role to bridge fundamental science with application and commercialisation of the results. The objectives of the network will be achieved by recruiting 11 early stage researchers and 1 experienced researcher. A mobility program will allow the researchers to spend time in the various laboratories of the network, thus facilitating sharing of resources and expertise. Local training at the host institutions will be supplemented by a training programme containing various elements such as biannual workshops and a summer school with the participation of experts from outside the network to realise efficient exchange of information and transfer of knowledge. The ITN thus combines world-class research with a unique education to strengthen Europe’s prominence in the timely field of nanoscience.",0,0
529,211447,No,"BOTFIND:  Finding Bots, Detect Harassing Automation, and Restoring Trust in Social Media Civic Engagement","Social media platforms have become tools for manipulating public opinion during elections. In particular, “bots” are algorithms that automate rapid, widespread interactions with citizens, often with deleterious effects on public knowledge of science, social inequality, and public policy options. Through the ERC COMPROP Consolidator award, researchers have demonstrated that even simple bots (i) effectively keep negative messages and fake news in circulation longer (ii) target journalists and civil society groups and (iii) operate with little oversight from social media firms. Such algorithms have negative consequences both for public trust in technology innovation and for the quality of public deliberation in Europe’s democracies. ERC researchers have been able to identify highly automated, politically-manipulative social media accounts post hoc. This project will allow researchers to take what we have learned and produce an online tool that allows people to evaluate suspicious social media accounts. Most social media platforms are slow to address troll and bot activity, so this innovative tool will put ERC research into public service in Europe—and around the world.",1,0
711,109347,No,"An ethical, legal and practical perspective on the impact of a new regulatory framework for the scientific use of animals on research and innovation","Research with animals is considered necessary to obtain certain vital knowledge for advancing health research and innovation, but the harm such research may cause animals is ethically problematic. The European legislation regulating animal experimentation is based on the need to balance the two important interests at stake: advancing research and protecting animal welfare. The public sensitivity of the issue is evidenced by the exceptional participation in the legislative process leading to a revised European legislation. Directive 2010/63/EU (presently under transposition into Member State legislation) will bring about substantial changes compared to the previous directive dating from 1986. One of the main objectives of revising this legislation is to create a greater harmonization of the governance of the use of animals in scientific (including medical) research for the European research area. The transposition is being accompanied by European Commission initiatives to promote a common interpretation of the legislation. However, major determinants of how research in Europe will be affected remain largely uncharted, in that little is published about how legal, ethical and scientific decisions about research will be made and how regulation will influence these decisions. A multidisciplinary team of academic researchers from different EU Member States will use literature reviews, questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups to provide a deeper understanding of how the regulation interacts with research and innovation through the new common legal framework for animal experimentation in the EU. ANIMPACT will address the effectiveness of the new Directive and the current law in relation to other established norms in ethics, law, and scientific research, with focus on its interaction with ethics review and project licensing processes. The project will further consider the impact of the Directive on academic and commercial competitiveness as well as on animal welfare.",1,0
46,212045,Yes,"European Integration, Populism and European Cities","Why is it so difficult to achieve further European political integration? This question motivates the first part of the project. The standard approach in economics presumes that integration of countries reflects a tradeoff between economic benefits and the cost of cultural heterogeneity. To assess this tradeoff, we exploit survey data to quantify cultural heterogeneity within and between EU countries, comparing it to the US. We also investigate time variation, to assess whether economic integration led to cultural convergence. Finally, exploiting regional variation, we seek to identify a cultural core and compare it to the economic core of the EU. We conjecture the following conclusion: although European economic integration has not led to cultural convergence, the primary obstacle to integration is not cultural heterogeneity per se, but the presence of other barriers, such as national identities or national institutions, which amplify its effects. The second part of the project studies the causes and implications of two related phenomena: the diffusion of nationalism and of political populism, with behavioral voters. We study nationalism as endogenous identification with one’s nation, and analyze how it interacts with political institutions and political processes in a setting of international policy coordination. We study populism as due to the reaction of disappointed voters who behave according to Prospect theory. Our main goal is to explain these behavioral phenomena, and to derive predictions about the effect of institutional reforms. The third part of the project examines Europe in the very long run. It studies the formation of clusters of creative élites within Europe, in a historical perspective. The main goal is to explain how local self-government institutions and the migration of upper tail human capital between different European cities contributed to the formation of clusters of innovation and creativity in the XI-XIX centuries.",1,1
763,97927,No,Boosting raw material and energy efficiency using advanced sheet structure design and fibre modifications,"BoostEff aims at developing new innovative manufacturing concepts for wood-fibre based products giving a significant reduction in environmental footprint. The targeted products are important commodities for the European society: paper and construction board. In spite of the different end uses, the paper making and construction board sectors share wood fibres as a common raw material and convert them into planar structures in which all materials are mixed with limited optimization of their performance. The common features of the three BoostEff Concepts is that they result in tailor-made layered structures: wood-fibres and other materials will be placed in the optimal position for the required functionality. This is achieved by developing and demonstrating separation and layering processes in connection with selective modification of sub-streams of the raw materials. The large potential of these process concepts within papermaking was shown in the FP6-project Ecotarget, where technologies were developed to perform these processes. BoostEff will transfer these techniques into a demonstration and industrial implementation phase in a multi-sectorial context. The BoostEff Concepts will be developed at pilot scale and implemented in full scale in three production units of the industrial partners in the project. Process and product development will proceed in parallel. This includes work for preparing the data necessary in order to proceed into investment projects at the targeted production units at the end of BoostEff. These results will be applicable not only for the specific production units but also serve as a basis for investments elsewhere within the two targeted industrial sectors. It is envisioned that the BoostEff project will contribute to developing more cost efficient and eco efficient processes and technologies, which will result in an upgraded profile for the targeted commodity products.",0,0
978,54446,No,The sustainability of european irrigated agriculture under water directive and agenda 2000 (WADI),"The project objective is to analyse the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Europe in the context of post Agenda 2000 CAP Reform and of the Water Framework Directive. Sustainability must be understood in its three dimensions: economic impact (farm income), social impact (direct labour and rural development) and environmental impact (water consumption, fertiliser.). Both institutions make necessary a broad analysis of the future or European irrigated agriculture. Nowadays these irrigated agriculture system need to be re-evaluated in term of sustainability, instead of the old profitability conception, taken into account, its multi-functional dimension. We will combine qualitative and quantitative analysis, and will implement a diffusion and discussion forum based upon internet technologies from the very starting point of project and using as much as possible FADN data and reviewing publication. Work package A: Set up scenarios framework for WATER POLICY: A1) Analysis of technology and physical structure of irrigation in Europe. A2) Laws and Institutions at national level analysis: water legal status, prices of water, markets of water, supplier companies and institution, structure investment funding, etc. A3) Analysis of European water policy (current situation, Directive proposal for water and normative related with the Environment). The report obtained lead to recommendations to aim to support the design and implementation of European policy. A4) Selection of set of indicators according ODCE guidelines The aim is the selection of a limited number of parameters that can be fed into the models that will be development under the WADI project, in order to evaluate the impact of different policy scenarios on irrigated agriculture and, indirectly, on the environment. A5) Prospective DELPHI analysis.  Work package B: Set up POST AGENDA-2000/WTO scenarios B1) Agenda 2000 impact on irrigated agriculture: Farming systems affected by the reform, impact on irrigated crops profitability, crops areas changes, evolution of employment generation, water consumption, fertilisers and pesticides uses, etc. B2) Global evolution of agriculture: irrigated products balance sheet in the following years, Agenda 2000 adjustments, WTO millennium round development, new Commission reform proposal, etc. B3) Combination of Agricultural and Water Policies Scenarios. This document replaces to the prospective Delphi Analysis, that we planned to obtain at the beginning of the project, but due to the important difficulties associated to it, we have decided to reach the same result by other path.  Work package C: Combines both analysis and produce 10 year scenarios.  Work package D: To define representative irrigated areas in each country D1) Descriptive analysis of irrigated Europe. Our previous experience shows that we may define four types of irrigated systems. D2) Analyse and define areas. We define different irrigated areas based in the following criteria: type of cropping pattern, technical characteristics of the system, management systems. D3) Analysis of selected areas and definition of representative farms. Finally, representative farm of the elected areas have been defined.  Work package E: Model representative farms in the selected areas E1)Define 2/4 representative farms by each of the selected areas in each country E2)Methodological definition of Mathematical Programming Technique.  Work package F: STATIC ANALYSIS F1) To set up parameters and define model. It is important to establish the relevant parameters for the model, thinking specially in the policy-testing objective. So attributes related to economics impact (income, gross margin, etc.), social Impact (employment generated, income distribution, etc.) and environmental impact must to be quantified in order to apply sustainability indicators. The most difficult attribute to integrate in the models is the complete environmental impact but we used OCDE suggestion as starting point for analysis. F2) Validation.  Work package G: DYNAMIC ANALYSIS. To define mathematical models of representative farm applying the methodology developed in the previous work package in order to have a satisfactory image of real systems. This model should be able to integrate evolutional behaviour or farmers along the time. G1) To set up parameters and define model.

126,103180,Yes,Building Efficient Models of Governance: the EU Regional Tier and improving Compliance with Global Rules,"In game-theoretical terms, global models of governance reduce uncertainty and can improve policy coordination, bargaining and predictability. However, despite voluntary commitment to such agreements, certain states are tempted to defect and free ride. The current context of economic crisis and political instability calls for efficient models of global governance and regional coordination. The EU has become a regulatory state (Majone, 1996) and has developed an extensive set of functional institutional mechanisms to overcome temptations to defect. This research explores the role of a regional tier as established in the EU as an efficient model of governance to improve compliance. The EU regional tier is based on a model of delegation of enforcement power to supranational institutions, access for private actors to enforcement mechanisms and the application of international laws that are embedded in the rules of the regional organization. Through quantitative and qualitative research this project seeks to unfold the causal relationship between the regional tier model of governance and compliance with international agreements in the areas of economic policies and and human rights in the EU and abroad (Asia, Latin America, Africa). Functional institutional designs can improve compliance. The regional tier of governance is expected to lock member states into compliance with legislative agreements from which they cannot easily opt-out, whereas stand-alone states display more flexible patterns of compliance. Also, the regional tier of governance is expected to improve compliance with global rules as a side product of efficient and credible commitment at the regional level and potentially at the international level through soft power capacities and bilateral agreements. This projects will also lead to the creation of an international compliance index for researchers, private actors and policy-makers.",1,1
770,34061,No,REPAIRING ERRORS IN COMPUTER AIDED LANGUAGE LEARNING,"RECALL is working towards more adequate and user-oriented software for computer-aided language learning by investigating intelligent feedback facilities as an enhancement to an existing commercial prototype. Prospective end-users include tutors and students, educational CD-ROM suppliers and corporate training departments. The system will enable the proficiency and strategies of individual learners to be dynamically profiled. It will detect errors in their input and offer feedback helping them to understand and avoid recurrence of their mistakes. RECALL has investigated the requirement to provide error correction as an enhancement to a prototype CALL package. The facility detects errors made by students and provides them with feedback in a way which helps them to understand the nature of their mistake and to learn from it. Such a facility is designed to offset the lack of flexibility and feedback in current systems.  The project has enabled progress towards more adequate and user-oriented CALL software by taking account of individual learner strengths and weaknesses, levels of proficiency, and preferred learning strategies. It will serve as a pilot study for future activities in the area of intelligent CALL applications.  The package incorporates a module that provides detailed linguistic analysis of the learner's response to exercises (a diagnosis component), a module that creates a dynamic model of the learner, representing his learning history (a learner model), and a module that controls the system's reactions to the learner's input and the structure of materials offered (a tutor model).  Progress  In the first year, work focused on a market survey and user requirements. A preliminary market report, based on the results of primary and secondary research was then finalised and distributed. The user requirements report is based around both structural and functionality factors in both the existing and the enhanced package. The results of the market and user studies led to changes in the design of the intelligent error correction component and have influenced future developments for CALL applications within the consortium.  The consortium set up two user groups, one for English as Foreign Language, the other for German. User meetings have been held for both groups and a report on these meetings profiles the members. A project help desk has been set up to maximise user participation and build on existing work to secure active and varied user group commitment and participation.  User Requirements  The user study aims at enhancing the functionality, usability and effectiveness of CALL systems in general, and the CASTLE demonstrator system in particular. Functionality was assessed using observation, questionnaires and interviews. The results were used to determine the structure of a CALL system and to design a functionality checklist to be used in quality assurance procedures and processes within system development.  Analysis of user requirements has involved two different classes of user:  - language learners or end users  - intermediate users such as CALL product suppliers, authors, tutors, publishers and language training centres.  Members of the latter class include many high profile European names in the business world.  Different techniques based on ISO standards were used to measure two prototype system versions. Comments and problems associated with each prototype were documented in a Usability Study report, which in turn was fed back in the software development process.  Further work has been completed on comparing learner reaction to 'traditional' courseware and to courseware with additional access to the CASTLE system. Protocol data from Castle has been used to obtain information about error situations and their contexts. Work to gather didactic information on which to base additional teaching strategies for CALL systems is on-going.  Requirements data was collected from 319 subjects.  The main important findings are:  - social interaction and business scores high for topics, holiday and travel are less important  - choice of style ranks less important than good coverage of vocabulary and grammar  - learning context should include home, work or language training organisation  - comprehensive coverage of learner grades is needed  - systems should not be used without guidance and competitive situations should be avoided  - ways of integrating the tutor's own material into the system is needed  - enhanced test procedures covering exam simulations are not necessary  - additional features such as word processing or interfaces to other packages would be useful.  Market Survey  The personal market sector for CALL products is experiencing the strongest growth, estimated at 50% per annum. The main influence in this sector is the increasing range of 'edutainment' CD-ROMs. Preferences are for attractively packaged products which are fun to use.  In the vocational training sector, large enterprises are the main users of multimedia educational tools, mainly as a result of bigger purchasing power compared to SMEs. High levels of computer literacy among executives and a positive attitude to learning technology are set to increase the size of the corporate market. Trends are towards home learning rather than training in company time which has given rise to increased interest in distance learning.  In the basic language training sector, growth has been inhibited by the lack of adequate basic IT infrastructures. This is changing and some countries have already launched initiatives to stimulate the use of CALL systems in this sector. Some growth is this sector is also coming from factors associated with the market situation in the personal sector. An emerging sub-segment in this sector is the primary school market.  Growth in Internet use has also led to more commercial initiatives in training and education. Better, faster and cheaper options for communications facilities will further enhance growth in the distance learning market.  Artificial intelligence technologies have led to improvements in CALL system features and functions in what has been termed ICALL (Intelligent CALL) or ITS (Intelligent Tutoring Systems). The development of ICALL reflects the shift from products which apply technology to a specific point in the learning process to products which act as a progressive guidance system that takes learners from beginners, through intermediate and on to advanced levels.  Components are now being linked together via hypermedia in order to provide a greater degree of learner independence and a more complete language learning experience in ICALL systems. An adequate error feedback component, as proposed by RECALL, is widely considered to be the missing link in the provision of 'learning' material.  System Architecture  The system architecture integrates the following components in the CASTLE CALL system:  - a Diagnosis component that provides detailed linguistic analysis of the learner's response to exercises  - a Learner model that creates a dynamic model of the learner, representing his learning history  - a Tutor model that controls the system's reactions to the learner's input and the structure of materials offered.  The Way Ahead  It is too early to appreciate the real contributions of RECALL. A great deal of serious work has been done, but the results so far make identification of a promising product difficult. The consortium will focus on a clear organisation and analysis of the tasks needed to implement intelligent error recognition and diagnosis and a self-assessment of the promise of the direction taken in this project, including presentation of the various obstacles encountered. These might take the form of commentary on the current system design. The design goals of each component and the pros and cons of the current choices, and the resources needed to provide complete error correction coverage for one useful level.  The consortium is optimistic about the significance of the theoretical work done on error analysis, but the ultimate value of the project lies in the degree to which it contributes to the development of systems capable of intelligent error recognition and feedback. The partners will therefore focus on demonstrating the path to intelligent error-handling systems, and contributing to understanding of the technical hurdles to be cleared. The demand for software for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is increasing considerably. This demand is driven by a growing need for foreign language skills in Europe and the particular feature of CALL in providing classroom and schedule-independent teaching devices. A drawback of most currently available CALL software, however, is that it cannot fully recognise the learner's mistakes and provide sophisticated feedback with respect to appropriate remedial or revision materials.   Progress and Results  The project encompasses preparatory activities and small-scale demonstration and verification. It assumes, as its platform and starting point, a commercial CALL system currently under development at the IBM Scientific Centre in Heidelberg, the CoALA (Computer Aided Language Acquisition) system. Within this preparatory stage, the project will investigate user requirements and market opportunities for an enhanced CALL product, with the focus on detection and correction of spelling, morphological, and syntactic errors. Semantic information, world knowledge, and inference only play a role to the extent that they are necessary to detect and diagnose these errors. Toward the end of this project, a small-scale demonstrator will sample the findings in the teaching of English and German and will be tested by several user organisations involved in or connected with the consortium.   Exploitation  Due to the preparatory nature of this project, the demonstrator will not cover the full functionality of the various components, but will be a showpiece to raise awareness concerning the inherent potential of 'intelligent' CALL. It is intended to use this and other results of the project to specify a follow-up project, undertaking the full implementation and validation of the system. The follow-up project would also extend into distance learning.   There are immediate business interests for the partners to engage in this area. The increasingly positive market opportunities for CALL products are an obvious motivation for IBM as a software manufacturer. For Exlingua International as a provider of linguistic education the aim is to provide language tuition, adjusted to fit the needs of the market and to do so at competitive rates and with the help of the most recent technology. Members of the user group have closely related interests either economically motivated (as publishers of electronic media) or as providers of cultural and educational services.",0,0
214,108802,No,Enabling knowledge for disaster risk reduction in integration to climate change adaptation,"“Mobilizing knowledge” suggests that there is need to dynamize the context in which knowledge about risks is developed, shared, and maintained. It conveys the implicit assumption that knowledge is perhaps currently fragmented and stuck in different compartments and bodies, be they institutions, agencies, universities, research centres, communities, individuals. While with this proposal we fully agree with this assumption, we think it is time to abandon the idea of a “knowledge transfer”, as a good that can be moved from the scientific arena into policy making or into administrative practices. The questions that we wish to ask are who should know what, who actually knows, and if knowledge produced in various ways and fields is effective in achieving disaster risk reduction and climate change prevention and adaptation. Three issues seem particularly relevant to explore: - Fragmentation and separations of arenas (i.e. Scientists, Public and private agencies or organizations in the field of prevention) - Changes that have occurred in risk knowledge management strategies overtime - Knowledge management about risk in times of crisis. The main objective of this proposal is to frame a knowledge management system for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation that may be considered as a comprehensive reference for establishing, reinforcing, or revising current prevention, mitigation and adaptation strategies. Such knowledge system will embody what has been achieved in different arenas and by different social groups in the field of prevention, preparedness and adaptation. In order to do so, a circular process between scientific and technical analysis and dissemination will be developed, so as to make use of a wider expertise and reach a larger audience. We want to use some of the dissemination activities as small tests of what deem should be done “at large” for creating an effective development, sharing, and maintenance of knowledge.",1,0
704,32140,No,CAPITALS' PROJECT FOR INTEGRATED TELEMATICS APPLICATIONS ON LARGE SCALE,"In CAPITALS, four EU capital cities will cooperate in the search for telematics-based solutions to their common traffic management and control problems. Project work will focus on enhanced transport authority information systems, better information for travellers, advanced traffic control strategies, long-term traffic forecasting and access control strategies in the interests of effective transport management. The project is expected to deliver better working information on traffic matters for citizens and management authorities alike.  Large metropolitan areas have in common specific transport problems created by intensive mobility demand and concentration of support measures for (supra)-national, business and logistic functions. Thus, the common overall objective has to be to sustain mobility for all kinds of users by developing, implementing, validating and exploiting telematics services in the transport sector.  As a result of the POLIS initiative, CAPITALS assembles public authorities which want to address their common problems in a cooperative way, from five large European metropolitan areas: Berlin, Brussels, Madrid, Paris and Roma.  To reach this objective, the CAPITALS project has defined common work areas in which the cities will improve:   - Traffic management and information systems to help and to assist decision makers and operators (authorities)  - Multi-modal information to better inform end-users and passengers  - Advanced traffic control strategies to improve traffic and environmental conditions  - Demand management to make better use of the available space in the conurbations.  In these common work areas, several applications and services will be developed, or if already available, improved and integrated in order to be validated and to be demonstrated. Several applications in the CAPITALS cities will be set up and almost all demonstrated:  - an integrated traffic management/information and its integration with a logistic and traffic information for transport enterprises (Berlin)  - a long-term forecasting model integrated in a traffic management system (Paris)  - a coordinated traffic information system for drivers by connecting traffic control centres with implementing multi-modal data servers for traffic information of service operators (Paris)  - the integration of advanced traffic control strategies and information on the ring road (Brussels)  - a traffic management tool to analyse, forecast and resolve traffic situations in conflicting areas (Madrid)  - the development of a multifunction smart card for several services and its integration with an information and electronic payment system and the related implementation of a policy for access control and road pricing (Roma)  - the implementation of an integrated parking information and pricing system in part of the urban area (Madrid).  After the demonstration of such systems, the overall result will be that a significant improvement will have been done to satisfy both user needs in terms of mainly traffic information and authority requirements of having available operational control and information strategies, systems and tools, and organisational schemes for eg. access control as well. Comparative assessment will be done - so far applicable - within the project itself and with other EU city projects. CAPITALS will contribute to harmonisation and standardisation in the relevant areas of work such as traffic information centres, electronic payment and pricing systems and advanced traffic control systems.",0,0
896,211492,No,AQUABUDDY-CARE: A Groundbreaking Solution for Elderly and Disabled people with Reduced Mobility that Finally Enables Caregivers to Effectively and Safely Bathe/Shower them in their own Beds.,"The progressive ageing of the population is becoming a major problem for society, who sees how ageing comes accompanied by crucial challenges that constraint our healthcare systems. Dependency is one of these challenges, adopting today the form of over 3 million Europeans unable to live independently due to ageing, disease, accidents or long term disability. These individuals rely and depend on caregivers to accomplish daily activities, being hygiene one of the most critical steps. Fulfilling hygiene tasks becomes specially challenging and time-consuming for the saturated personnel at hospitals, clinics or elderly homes, who need to be extra careful with these patients at higher risk of infection. The complexity of the current processes to wash or bathe bedbound patients (which involves transferring the patient out of bed) enters in conflict with the workload pressure faced by caregivers (which limits the time available for each patient). In response, we have developed and validated Aquabuddy-CARE (AQB), a miniaturized and portable shower system that enables patients to undertake hygiene tasks in bed, rapidly and in a dignified manner. The combination of advanced materials, sustainable production process and proprietary water flow system guarantees the efficiency of the technology concerning water consumption and prevention of contamination. After completing the validation at the pilot scale, this project aims to finalise the industrialization and field-testing of AQB. The Feasibility Study planned in Phase 1 will help us secure the project from all technical, financial and commercial standpoints. Once in the market, AQB will bring significant benefits for caregivers and patients worldwide, helping to alleviate the raising impact of ageing and disability while improving their life quality. In turn, AQB will boost our growth, expecting to hire 12 new people in 5 years, gain €11.2 million in profits and reach a ROI of 4.6 per euro invested in the project.",0,0
956,210071,No,Financing Ambitious Local Climate Objectives,"Implementing ambitious local climate action plans is paramount in the fight against climate change. Moreover, the sheer aggregated investment volume contained in these plans holds the promise of a powerful longlasting economic recovery. Unfortunately, the lack of a comprehensive funding solution undermines the realisation of these plans.    FALCO addresses this problem by developing a financing solution for ambitious local climate plans of over 180 Flemish signatories to the Covenant of Mayors (“FLC Solution”). This solution builds on the results of several previous projects, integrates state of the art knowledge on sustainable energy financing, and was tested at the conceptual level. Unlike other solutions, the FLC solution 1) looks at the climate action plans as a whole (potential for piggybacking) instead of adopting a project-per-project view (risk of cherry picking); 2) focuses on lifting financial and non-financial investment barriers; and 3) uses private capital instead of public budgets for its financing operations. In addition, FALCO will develop accompanying (policy) measures that will induce demand for investments.   FALCO is designed as a scalable pilot that allows real-life testing of the FLC solution.    FALCO will: • Develop the theoretical FLC solution into a fully operational financial solution (WP2); • Develop a project portfolio (ca. 50 mio €) w.r.t. energy efficiency in SMEs and energy renovation of public and private buildings (WP3); • Have an independent party due diligence validate the proposed financial solution and project portfolio (WP4); • Contract investments for at ca. 17.6 mio € resulting in an estimated 27.7 GWh primary energy savings and the creation of 250 sustainable jobs (WP5); • Monitor the investments and document lessons learnt (WP6); • Disseminate the results in Flanders and in the EU, investigate its replication in other EU member states /regions (WP7).",0,0
538,108702,No,Collaboration to Clarify the Cost of Curation,"The Collaboration to Clarify the Costs of Curation (4C) project will help organisations across Europe to more effectively invest in digital curation and preservation. Making an investment inevitably involves a cost and existing research on cost modelling provides the starting point for the 4C work. But the point of an investment is to realise a benefit, so work on cost must also focus on benefit, which must then encompass related concepts such as 'risk', 'value', 'quality' and 'sustainability'. Organisations that understand this will be more able to effectively control and manage their digital assets over time, but they may also be able to create new cost-effective solutions and services for others.<br/>Existing research into cost modelling is far from complete and there has been little uptake of the tools and methods that have been developed and very little integration into other digital curation processes. The main objective of the 4C project is, therefore, to ensure that where existing work is relevant, that stakeholders realise and understand how to employ those resources. But the additional aim of the work is to closely examine how they might be made more fit-for-purpose, relevant and useable by a wide range of organisations operating at different scales in both the public and the private sector.<br/>These objectives will be achieved by a coordinated programme of outreach and engagement that will identify existing and emerging research and analyse user requirements. This will inform an assessment of where there are gaps in the current provision of tools, frameworks and models. The project will support stakeholders to better understand and articulate their requirements and will clarify some of the complexity of the relationships between cost and other factors. The outputs of this project will include various stakeholder engagement and dissemination events (focus groups, workshops, a conference), a series of reports, the creation of models and specifications, and the establishment of an international Curation Costs Exchange framework. All of this activity will enable the definition of a research and development agenda and a business engagement strategy which will be delivered to the European Commission in the form of a roadmap.<br/>The consortium undertaking this project includes organisations with extensive domain expertise and experience with curation cost modelling issues. It includes national libraries and archives, specialist preservation and curation membership organisations, service providers, research departments and SME's.

259,21964,No,Simulation and Animation for Interactive Design,"The aim of the SIMAID project is to develop advanced 3D general purpose computer simulation tools, able to be used in design and production environments in the mechanical engineering field. The simulation models will focus on complex mechanical systems, integrating dynamics of rigid and deformable multibody systems, controls, impacts and collisions under a common simulation shell. Additionally, mechanical simulation will be linked to event-driven simulation of complex electronic systems using VDHL description language.  A key objective of this project is to achieve higher interactivity and even real-time response for more complex dynamic analysis, for which it is necessary to develop improved mathematical algorithms for solving the constrained equations of motion applicable to both closed and open kinematic chains with both rigid and flexible bodies. According to some preliminary results obtained with software prototypes, this objective is ambitious but achievable, considering the foreseeable improvements in both software and hardware, and could be reached by building on the expertise of partners within the consortium, and .   The outcome of the project will be a truly 3D interactive general-purpose simulation program, with capabilities for simultaneous analysis, visualisation and input/output. This will result in a much more productive tool, compared with most existing commercial systems, based on independent stages for pre-processing, analysis and post-processing.   During the development of the SIMAID project, it is expected to achieve improvements in efficiency of two orders of magnitude in the multibody systems simulation. This will contribute to boosting the competitiveness of European industries, where simulation is a critical issue for product quality and for shortening the duration of development cycles.",0,0
708,94928,No,Utilitarian Fiction: Bentham's View of Language in its Theoretical and Historical Context,"Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) is very well known for his utilitarian ethics. However, he based his ethical views on a specific conception of language and mind. The project aims at giving a new account of Bentham’s philosophy of language, in its connection both with Bentham’s more known utilitarian claims in ethics, political theory and philosophy of law, and with the broad context of the Enlightenment debate on ethics, language and mind in Europe. This new account will be based on Bentham’s original manuscripts concerning philosophy of language and logic. These manuscripts have been very poorly edited in the 19th century edition of Bentham’s work, and this fact distorted the received view of Benham’s ideas on language. Bentham’s ideas on language have not yet received a comprehensive and satisfactory treatment, both from a conceptual point of view and from a historical perspective. A typescript of the original materials has been recently prepared at the Bentham Project, University College London, in the preliminary operations for the new authoritative edition of Bentham’s work on language, which has not yet been published. The research will take this typescript as its main ground, and will contribute to the the work needed for the new edition of Bentham’s writings on logic and language. Moreover, a detailed study of Bentham’s explicit and implicit sources in British and French thought will be conducted. In particular, three groups of authors will be considered: British Empiricists such as Locke, Hume, and Berkeley; French Enlighteners such as D’Alembert and Condillac; authors engaged in the discussion about language, grammar and etymology in Britain, such as James Harris and John Horne Tooke. These authors are explicitly mentioned by Bentham. Moreover, an inquiry of the semiotic tradition present in Hobbes’ philosophy of language and its influence on Bentham will be conducted. Finally, a view of the relations between language and ethics in Bentham will be produced.",0,0

77,91046,Yes,"Meeting the challenges of economic uncertainty and sustainability through employment, industrial relations, social and environmental policies in European countries","Coping with economic uncertainty while seeking security is a central dilemma of public policy in a globalising economy. A complex set of deals and conflicts are involved in the process of distributing the gains and the burdens of that uncertainty, and various forms of employment contracts and labour and social policies express their outcome. This project is concerned with the study of that process and its implications for societal models. In the course of conflict a number of different institutions engage in new practices; and there is a new diversity of employment forms and tenures. Social policy becomes increasingly integrated with employment and industrial relations practices, while both the sustainability of the institutions themselves and their impact on the natural environment require consideration.    Challenges are also presented by the different forms of governance at work in the various policy fields. The crisis of the Keynesian model was often seen as a crisis for associational governance (or neo-corporatism), and an advance for reliance on market governance (usually assisted by strong elements of government intervention). Since then, policy-making by individual large corporations often seems to be replacing associational governance as well as government policy-making in fields of employment categories and rights, pay determination, and the determination of pensions. However, the public goods issues raised by uncertainty and environmental damage bring again into question the adequacy of governance by the market and individual firms. We should expect to find radical changes in the societal models that we have become accustomed to using in the analysis of social policy. There is a search for new modes of governance, or new combinations of old ones.",1,1
897,222797,No,Imaging circles of engagement: Neural correlates of parent empathic distress in the context of chronic pain,"Chronic pain affects the lives of over a quarter of adolescents world-wide. For a parent to see their child suffering is particularly distressing. Not surprisingly, parents of children with chronic pain are more likely to suffer from stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Vice versa, parent responses can powerfully modulate (i.e., mitigate or magnify) their child’s pain-related functioning. A key, so far neglected, variable may be parent empathic distress, hindering the parents’ ability to respond in ways to promote the child’s functioning. The neural mechanisms underlying parent empathic distress and its impact have not been studied before and will be the main focus of this proposal. I hypothesize that parents’ empathic distress triggered by observing their child’s pain is of key importance for understanding parent-child interactions in the context of paediatric pain and that identifying the driving mechanisms will provide novel points for parent-targeted treatments. PARENT_EMPATHY is a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study and will recruit parent-child dyads in which the child has chronic pain via the Pediatric Pain Management Clinic at Stanford’s Children’s Health. Using an empathy paradigm, I will define the physiological and neural correlates of parent empathic distress in response to observing their own child’s pain (facial expressions combined with autobiographical vignettes). Further, I will examine the contribution of parent empathic distress to individual differences in parent pain-related behavior as well as in the child’s pain-related functioning. This MSCA will enable me to carry out my independent project with the Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain (BPP) lab at Stanford University, reinforcing my scientific maturity. Working in this inspiring and successful environment with ample opportunities to enjoy superb training programs will boost my professional, scientific and personal development, and will greatly enhance my career possibilities.",0,0

154,83120,Yes,The transformation of Ashkenazi Jewish culture in the Early Modern Period,"Jewish studies are a crucial interdisciplinary research area of the European cultural heritage. Not all fields within it have been equally researched. There is a significant amount of Hebrew and Yiddish primary sources lying completely neglected in Czech and Moravian archives, which could greatly contribute to our knowledge of Jewish history and culture.  The applicant would cooperate with Department of Jewish Studies at Palacky University in Olomouc (Czech Republic) on mapping and interpreting this unique source material while using it in an attempt to answer his own particular research question. From the second half of the 15th century on leading intellectuals of Bohemian, Moravian, and Polish Jews gradually became interested in both the medieval tradition o f Jewish philosophy and the new scientific worldview created by the scientific revolution of the 17th century. They tried to combine and harmonize the medieval tradition with the latest results of the new sciences.  As a consequence of their activity the medieval tradition of meditative thinking became separated from science and philosophy but survived in the form of literature emerging as a new way of expressing ideas and thoughts independently of science, philosophy, and religion. Thus the early modern rabbis in Eastern Central Europe laid down the foundations of modern European Jewish culture including both scientific and artistic aspects. There is no answer in present day scholarship to the obvious question: why did this transformation of the European (Ashkenazi) Jewish culture take place.  The relevant source material has not been described systematically either. The applicant will prepare a systematic description of the relevant source material and will try to answer the basic research question by applying Michel Foucaults method of discourse-analysis. He will try to integrate the results of Czech, Hungarian, and Western scholars rarely communicating with each other.",0,1

VISION aims to specify and develop key interface features in fundamental cornerstones of VR technology, namely in immersive visualization and interaction, so as to improve the flexibility, the performance and cost efficiency of human-oriented life cycle procedures, related to critical aircraft-related virtual products (e.g. virtual cockpit, virtual cabin etc.).   The upstream research roadmap of VISION will involve a) specific human-oriented developments on simulation features, such as the visual perception, the real-time rendering, the markerless body tracking, the smart objects interaction, the interaction metaphors, b) an integration of the features in a common IT platform, and c) a validation based on test cases focused on specific aircraft-related virtual products.   The achievements of VISION will enhance the credibility of the human-in-the loop aircraft-related VR simulations.  They will further enhance the engineering context of the aircraft-related virtual products by enabling their increased use for activities, such as design verification, ergonomics validation, specifications of equipment displays, operational and situational training. The VISION project aims to develop new technology in support of the design and ‘virtual prototyping’ of critical aircraft-related products. It will improve the human-oriented functionality and usage of these virtual products along their life-cycle. Thus, it addresses the 'Design Systems & Tools' and 'Human Factors' Call topics.

758,26905,No,Effet de l'ingestion des produits laitiers fermentes sur la capacite immunitaire des sujets nourris et malnourris,"- Comparative effects of yoghurt (enriched with non-pathogenic lactic bacterial) and milk consumption on immunocompetence in a healthy population; - Comparative effects of yoghurt (enriched with non-pathogenic lactic bacteria) and milk consumption on immunocompetence and on nutritional recovery on two malnourished groups : - young patients (12-18 years old) suffering from anorexia nervosa (eating disorder increasingly seen in developed countries); - malnourished African children (4-24 montsh). - According to STD programme, within general objectives, we tried to establish the role played by fermented dairy products on immune capacity and thereby on nutritional status and recovery. Spain - Thirty patients with anorexia nervosa (aged 10-19- were tested) in a 10 weeks follow-up study. The patients were divided in two groups depending on their dairy intake of (1) milk or (2) yoghurt (3/day). Calories supplied by milk or yoghurt were similar. The rest of the dietary calories supplied was similar in both groups. Measurements were carried out in three stages : - at the admission to the hospital; - after six weeks; - after ten weeks of the admission. - The results were compared with 35 young women's volunteers matched by age, sex and socio-cultural level, who were also divided in two groups like the anorexic patients. - Regarding food habits of the patients tested, 13% and 19% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively suffered from vomiting. - None of the patients had menstruation at the beginning of the study. 25% and 17% of patients receiving yoghurt or milk therapy, respectively recovered menstruation at the end of the study. Diarrhea symptoms after refeeding decreased in the group with yoghurt therapy. - The dietary profile for both groups of patients was similar and showed a significant higher percentage of carbohydrates and lower percentage of lipids in comparison with both groups of controls. - In relation to anthropometry, as expected, no modifications were found between both groups of anorexic patients in each stage. However, in both groups of patients, there was a significant increase of weight, BMI and IBW percentage in stage 2, which remained at the same level in stage 3, in comparison with stage 1. Despite the fact that there was an increase of ponderal values in anorexi nervosa patients, all the parameters were lower than in controls. BMI values did not reach 19, the lowest level necessary to be within the normal range. - Haematological parameters of anorexia nervosa patients were within the normal range in both groups, however, all of them showed values below controls. In relation to leukocyte profile, those patients submitted to the yoghurt therapy showed higher eosinophil levels at stage 2, while eosinophil counting was higher in patients undergoing milk intake at stage 3. Regarding lymphocyte subset percentages, significant differences were found in stages 2 and 3, in comparison with stage 1. In general, there was a better situation for those patients under yoghurt therapy. Serum immunoglobulins (Ig G, A and M) and C3 and C4 complement factors were significantly higher in those patients with yoghurt therapy.  France - Yoghurt intake on stimulation of immune response was investigated on Peyer patches, spleen and blood. Interferon-gamma, lymphocyte proliferation and the rate of different immunocompetent cells were evaluated. - The study was carried out in Wistar-Furth female rats aged 8 weeks that were submitted to a semi-sinthetic diet enriched with yoghurt or milk (35%) for 4 weeks. Immunocompetent cells, previously removed, were cultured in presence of Con A or yoghurt bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). Interferon-gamma was measured in the supernatants by ELISA and the immunocompetent cells were determined by flow cytometry. - Yoghurt bacteria were capable to stimulate Interferon-gamma both in Peyer platches and spleen, and in addition induced cell proliferation in Peyer platches, spleen and blood. However, no modifications were found in immunocompetent cell rates, except B lymphocytes of Peyer platches, which increased after yoghurt intake. - Regular consumption of lactic bacteria induced an increase in non-specific responses against mitoges (ConA), which could suggest an important role of non-pathogen bacteria by improving immunological balance as well as by maintaining host-resistance against pathogen agents. This finding may be significant especially in malnutrition or anorexia nervosa patients where the immune system is depressed.   Morocco - In order to evaluate the effect of nutritional refeeding on Interferon-gamma production in malnourished children, 15 infants aged among 6 and 30 months with a weight/height between 60 and 80% (NCHS tables) were admitted to the Paediatric Hospital in Rabat (PO) until they reached 90% of their weight/height ratio (P1). Hospitalisation period average was 30 days. During this period, children received fermented milk diet with a caloric density of 100 cal/100 ml in addition to a vitamin and mineral supplementation. The consumption was 100 cal/kg/d for 10 days and 150-200 cal/kg/d there after. - In addition, an iron supplementation (100 mg/d) was included in the diet after the 10th day of hospitalisation. - Blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured with lactic bacteria Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus for 72 hours. The cell-free supernatants from cultures were assayed for Interferon-gamma by ELISA. The samples were collected in PO and P1. - Although iron supplementation was administrated to the children, their haemoglobin values, which were lower than 11 g/dL in PO, only reached normal levels 3 months after the admission in hospital. Interferon-gamma production in malnourished children was lower than 10 pg/mL in PO. After refeeding (P1) Interferon-gamma production was higher than 150 pg/mL. - Conclusion : the low haemoglobin values found in the malnourished children did not affect Interferon-gamma production after refeeding. Children showed a good tolerance when yoghurt was included in the diet. Yoghurt intake enhanced Interferon-gamma production. Thus, it would be important to stress the fact that this cytokine production may act as an immunological protection against pathogen micro-organisms in infants who are particularly sensitive to infections since they are malnourished.  - One ot the causes of the increased susceptibility to infectious disease of malnourished individuals is an impaired immune function. In addition, immunocompetence has been shown to be depleted by infection and to be a sensitive and functional measure of the nutritional status. This work was aimed at assessing the effect of yoghurt (enriched with non-pathogenic lactic bacteria) consumption on immune capacity and thereby on nutritional status and recovery in three groups : - control, consisting of 50 healthy subjects (12-18 years old); - twenty patients (12-18 years old) suffering from aenorexia nervosa (eating disorder increasingly in developed countries); - twenty malnourished African children (4-24 months).  - Each group was divided into two subgroups : - 300 ml/day yoghurt consumption during 2 months; - 300 ml/day milk consumption during 2 months. - Dietary intake and anthropometric parameters (weight, height, body mass index, ideal body weight percentage, skin folds) were measured. The following immunological parameters : lymphocyte proliferation, B lymphocytes (CD19), T lymphocyte subsets (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8), NK lymphocytes (CD57), serum C3 and C4 complement factors and interferon production were evaluated.",0,0
804,91843,No,The Mamlukisation of the Mamluk Sultanate. Political Traditions and State Formation in 15th century Egypt and Syria,"I aim to radically reconsider standard views of late medieval Islamic history. Positing that prosopographical research will allow for a welcome reconstruction of the political traditions that dominated the Syro-Egyptian Mamluk sultanate in the 15th century, I endeavour to show how new traditions emerged that were constructed around the criterion of military slavery, and how this actually reflects a process of state formation, which puts this regime on a par with emerging European states. Mamluk history (1250-1517) tends to be approached through a decline prism, as almost all studies presuppose that a static mamluk/military slavery system was the backbone of the political economy that came under increasing pressures from the 14th century onwards. In my research, I have demonstrated how this view of the 14th century, in particular, is totally incorrect, suggesting that it was only in the 15th century that crucial political transformations took place in the region. My proposed research now aims to qualify the latter hypothesis and to reconstruct the dynamics of these transformations, via a thorough examination of the interplay between individuals, institutions, and social interactions in the course of 15th-century political events, as detailed in the massive corpus of contemporary source material. Results will be generated in three stages: via prosopographical study; through separate, but inter-related studies on the main research constituents (individuals, institutions, interaction); and in a book-length synthesis on political traditions. In the longer term, validation of this hypothesis will enable me to address fundamental new questions in pre-modern (Islamic) history, as part of trans-cultural processes common to all Euro-Mediterranean core regions.",1,0
666,59281,No,Fens Winter School: Nervous System Reaction to Neuronal Loss and Injury,"Neuronal loss and injury is one of the major problems in current neurology. There is an urgent need for therapies that are currently not yet available. However, modern molecular neuroscience has recently lead to exciting new insight into mechanisms that are involved in neuronal cell death. Therefore, a special training of promising young scientists in the field should have a major impact on the development of science in this field towards new therapies. The discovery of new mechanisms and molecules that are involved in neuronal development, differentiation, cell death as well as degeneration and regeneration has tremendously emerged in recent years. A variety of new hypotheses is currently under investigation with impact on the development of new therapeutic strategies in treating injury of the nervous system.

124,108781,Yes,Re-linking suburban youths in Madrid and Paris. The “new localism” and the rol of social and ethnic networks in the integration of youth from immigrant origin,"In global European cities, youth from immigrant origin who live in disadvantaged areas are disconnected from the networks likely to offer them educational and work opportunities. However, in these poor areas, the negative structural conditions contrast with the capacity of action led by the social networks. We are witnessing the rebirth of localism as a way of condemning the weakening of the Welfare State.  There are no comparative studies among North-western and Southern European countries that focus on the principal role played by the civil society in the socialization of youngsters in peripheral neighborhoods. LOCALYOUTH therefore fills a need for comparing the situation of youths between 16 and 29 years in two banlieues of Paris and two barrios of Madrid by taking into account the collective action taken in these environments at a grassroots level. Through an in-depth study of four integration projects of urban and social development a critical evaluation shall be performed on the role played by community networks. An analysis of the importance of the ethnic and gender dimension in the composition of those networks will also be done.  The methodology combined case studies, comparative-historical perspective and sociological intervention. Participation observation in associations will be carried out and combined with interviews to people with a long life history in local areas and focus groups with social educators, leaders of associations and policy makers involved in the projects selected for the analysis. In addition, two Sociological Interventions in Madrid and Paris will provide an in-depth knowledge about the situation of the young people and the news dynamics of local participation in two European countries. In summary, LOCALYOUTH offers news keys of analysis to understand and demonstrate a shift towards a new localism and identify the elements (inside the ethnic and local community) that help or limit the upward mobility of youth from immigrant origin.",1,1
18,209954,Yes,Innovation by Law Enforcement Agencies networking,"The ILEAnet project will set up and develop a sustainable network of Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) practitioner organisations from all over Europe. The mission of this network will be to stimulate LEA capabilities to influence, develop and take up research, development and innovation (RDI) that is useful and usable for LEAs, and thereby help them to tackle the major challenges they face. The network will be organised around ILEAnet National Contacts (INCs) who will be in charge of federating the respective networks of practitioners, policy makers, academics, industrial players and other RDI stakeholders in their respective countries. ILEAnet will also operate as a community of people with a common interest in exchanging and collaborating with respect to LEA challenges and needs and LEA-centred RDI. Whilst the organisational ILEAnet Network will be focused – “top-down” - on specific challenges, the ILEAnet Community of people will contribute “bottom-up” ideas to produce innovative approaches to face newly arising challenges.  An online community platform will enable professional social networking and mutual online assistance related to new solutions and best practice to address LEA challenges. The platform will support online and physical meetings and discussions, and will provide the infrastructure for efficient knowledge management. Synthesising top-down approaches and bottom-up ideas in iterative survey-organise-brainstorm-analyse-propose-discuss-poll processes, ILEAnet will build up a broad portfolio of RDI results and new RDI project concepts, and will deliver recommendations for future RDI policies. ILEAnet will hence catalyse innovation between LEAs and between LEAs, academics and industry. This will enable LEAs not only to take up mature results but also to prepare and influence future RDI efforts which could be taken up by individual or groupings of organisations and countries as well as by European research funding programmes.",0,1
62,217984,Yes,"Strengthening European integration through the analysis of conflict discourses: revisiting the past, anticipating the future","RePAST aims at investigating how European societies deal with their troubled pasts today through the analysis of conflict discourses rooted in those pasts, with a view on the impact of those discourses on European integration. It will implement actions and propose strategies, both at the levels of policy-making and civil society, for reflecting upon these discourses to strengthen European integration. The project addresses directly the specific challenge and scope of the topic CULT-COOP-02-2017, focusing on civil society, informal education and political discourses. The methodological approach of RePAST is based on (i) multidisciplinarity, (ii) cross-country comparative analysis and (iii) innovative actions for citizens’ engagement with troubled pasts. First, conflict discourses rooted in troubled pasts will be studied in four fundamental spaces of civil society and sources of informal education: (a) history (oral and official), (b) media (journalistic- and citizen-led media), (c) art and culture, (d) politics (formal and informal politics). It will also take into account how the current crisis in its multiple forms (economic crisis, refugee crisis, political crisis) mediates these narratives. RePAST brings the various disciplines in dialogue with each other on the ground of an empirical study across the geographical and historical spectrum. Second, RePAST will study comparatively eight cases of countries whose troubled pasts sit squarely on legacies that still endanger European integration today: Cyprus, Germany, Poland, Greece, Bosnia, Kosovo, Ireland, and Spain. Lastly, RePAST emphasizes the active engagement of memory agents through a series of innovative actions for creating participatory experiences, i.e. interactive storytelling, research tool for analysis on memory and conflict, workshops for cultural tourism professionals, a treasure-hunt game to discover troubled pasts, and digital games for renegotiating troubled pasts.",1,1
789,215344,No,"Clothing, fashion and nation building in the Land of Israel","'Culture is central to nation building, but clothing, fashion and aesthetic perceptions are often overlooked in this context. Taking 'Eretz Israel' (the 'Land of Israel') as a case study, this project argues that investigating these cultural practices brings to the fore the agency of migrant groups and adds a personal dimension to the history of nation building. Focusing on the period from the 1880s when large-scale migration began, until the foundation of the Israeli state in 1948, it investigates how Eastern European and German Jewish immigrants expressed social, cultural and political belonging through clothing and to what extent they were able to enforce their ideologies in the course of nation building. It asks to what extent the immigrants influenced each other in developing a specific mode of dress, and how they referenced the socio-cultural and political practices of countries of origin, as well as the clothing of Arab people and the Ottoman and British occupying authorities. With an unprecedented focus on gender and visual materials, the project examines how clothing became fashion and to what extent a consensual mode of dress emerged within a heterogeneous migrant society. Drawing from archival collections of 15 archives in Israel, Poland and England, and 6 Israeli, German, American and Russian databases, the project analyses private and public photographs and posters, and contextualises them against an assessment of written material and oral history interviews. Through highly interdisciplinary training, the project develops a new methodology that integrates approaches from fashion history and visual culture into the history of nation building to shed light on the processes of negotiation and power struggles on the micro level of a community. In times of mass migration, economic exploitation and global mobility the project contributes to an understanding of aesthetic perceptions, dress and beauty ideals as an expression of power, integration and exclusion.'",1,0
536,194301,No,Modelling the European data economy,"The Modelling the European Data Economy (EuDEco) project will assist European sci-ence and industry in understanding and exploiting the potentials of data reuse in the context of Big and Open Data big data. The aim isto establish a self sustaining data market and thereby increase the competitiveness of Europe. To be able to extract the benefits of data reuse, it is crucial to know how to understand the underlying economic, societal, legal, and technological framework conditions and challenges to build useful applications and services. Despite the amount of activities in this domain, an effort is missing to develop use cases and business models that are economic viable, legally certain and taking societal needs and concerns into account.  EuDEco will accomplish this by leveraging the engagement of other projects conducting pilots on data reuse as well as by the engagement of external experts and stakeholders. EuDEco moves beyond the classical approaches by applying the approach of complex adaptive systems to model the data economy in order to indentify value networks, use cases and business models for data reuse. In the course of the project will develop and refine the data economy model in several steps further by case studies on previous pilots on data reuse, by in-depth analysis from legal, socioeconomic and technological point of view, and by extensive tests of use cases and business models with other projects. Therefore it will analyse framework conditions relevant and challenges related to data reuse and the emergence of a self-sustaining data market.  Finally, EuDEco will deliver a model of the data economy including viable use cases and business models as well as suggestions and recommendations addressing the main legal, contractual, societal, and technological concerns and challenges such as contractual framework or data protection. Above that EuDEco will develop an observatory for policy makers enabling them to track the development of the data economy.",0,0

These needs are mostly related to the integration of three main sources of information: clinical data (EHR), patient-specific genomic and proteomic data (in particular data produced through Micro-arrays technology), and demographic data. The general aim of the project will be the development of a knowledge management environment to allow networks of co-operating medical research centres to create, exchange and manipulate new knowledge from heterogeneous data sources.  MULTI-KNOWLEDGE will create an intelligent workflow environment for multi-national multi-professional research consortia aiming at cooperatively mining, modelling, visualizing biomedical data under a single common perspective. This will allow retrieval and analysis of millions of data through bio-informatics tools, with the intent of improving medical knowledge discovery and understanding through integration of biomedical information.  MULTI-KNOWLEDGE will contribute to the creation of standards to link heterogeneous data. The clusterization models produced within the project will allow discrimination between normal and pathologic and produce insight for clinical research and disease management. The MULTI-KNOWLEDGE architecture and set of tools will be tested for the development of a structured system to integrate data in a single informative system committed to cardiovascular risk assessment.

100,214702,Yes,"Justice Interactions and Peacebuilding: From Static to Dynamic Discourses across National, Ethnic, Gender and Age Groups","JUSTINT will provide a novel way of analysing how post-conflict justice practices, such as war crimes trials and truth-seeking, advance or hinder peacebuilding. It breaks away radically from existing approaches and examines an interactive and dynamic aspect of discourse. Until now, we have relied on statements by politicians, civil society actors, or victims to understand their response to post-conflict justice, and studied them as static discourses. Instead, we need to investigate communicative exchanges to understand how discussions about the violent past unfold, and to what effect.  JUSTINT asks: how do people interact with each other in response to post-conflict justice across national, ethnic, gender and age groups in different deliberative domains? Do their views change in these interactions, and how? Written and spoken communication can provide strong evidence of attitudes and of their transformation. JUSTINT will apply Quantitative Text Analysis and Conversation Analysis to interactions in face-to-face and virtual deliberative domains (courts, parliaments, civil society debates, blogs, Web-based comments, and Twitter).  This mixed-method research will deliver fine-grained multi-language empirical analysis of patterns of discourse in four former Yugoslav countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Croatia), selected as a typical case of post-conflict justice practices. It will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team (three political scientists with expertise in peacebuilding, post-conflict justice and political behaviour, a gender specialist, a computational linguist and a quantitative text analyst).  JUSTINT will generate a theory of justice interactions, and open up significant new research horizons at the intersection of peacebuilding and deliberation. It will break new ground by studying justice discourses at the level of words and conversational sequences through interdisciplinary integration and methodological innovation.",1,1
902,108843,No,Creating Co-Adaptive Human-Computer Partnerships,"'CREATIV explores how the concept of co-adaptation can revolutionize the design and use of interactive software. Co-adaptation is the parallel phenomenon in which users both adapt their behavior to the system’s constraints, learning its power and idiosyncrasies, and appropriate the system for their own needs, often using it in ways unintended by the system designer. A key insight in designing for co-adaptation is that we can encapsulate interactions and treat them as first class objects, called interaction instruments This lets us focus on the specific characteristics of how human users express their intentions, both learning from and controlling the system. By making instruments co-adaptive, we can radically change how people use interactive systems, providing incrementally learnable paths that offer users greater expressive power and mastery of their technology. The project offers theoretical, technical and empirical contributions. CREATIV will develop a novel architecture and generative principles for creating co-adaptive instruments. The multi-disciplinary design team includes computer scientists, social scientists and designers as well as ‘extreme users’, creative professionals who push the limits of their technology. Using participatory design techniques, we will articulate the design space for co-adaptive instruments and build a series of prototypes. Evaluation activities include qualitative and quantitative studies, in the lab and in the field, to test hypotheses and assess the success of the prototypes. The initial goal of the CREATIV project is to fundamentally improve the learning and expressive capabilities of advanced users of creative software, offering significantly enhanced methods for expressing and exploring their ideas. The ultimate goal is to radically transform interactive systems for everyone by creating a powerful and flexible partnership between human users and interactive technology.'",0,0

This issue has not yet been systematically addressed on a large scale, although the reduction of gender inequality is generally considered an important issue within Europe. Therefore, ITN LCG will provide a structured interdisciplinary research training programme for young researchers in the emerging supra-disciplinary field of language, cognition, and gender to enhance the scientific understanding of this topic and improve the quality of initial research training in Europe. For the first time, these lines of research will be investigated from cross-language and cross-cultural perspectives by bringing together 10 complementary providers of research-training and 12 associated partners from public and private sectors. ITN LCG has four interrelated research objectives: a) deriving indices for selected European languages that reflect the extent to which the features of a language result in gender related representations in speakers/listeners, b) investigating to what extent gender equality in formal standards of language and the use of gender-fair language correlates with higher levels of socio-economic gender equality, c) analysing the impact of language on gender stereotyping in social judgement and decision making, and d) developing and evaluating scientifically-based prototypes of guidelines and training tools for gender-fair communication in European languages. ITN LCG will strengthen the capability of its young fellows to contribute effectively to our knowledge-based economy and society, and will add to their intersectoral and transnational employability.",1,0
603,79912,No,Youth - actor of social change,"The Coordination Action on youth as actor of social change searches answers to the following challenges of individualisation which are related to the conditions and obstacles which young people face in rapidly changing European societies and which affect their social integration:  - How do young people's decisions and coping strategies relate to changing social structures? - What conditions in existing intergenerational relationships are responsible for young people's integration and individualisation as active citizens with regard to social change? - What policies enable young people to actively influence social change? These leading questions will be investigated in three thematic areas which represent crucial situations and status of young people in European societies: 1. Young parenthood as the question of gendered individualisation and the challenge of reproduction; 2. Transitions to work and the challenge of socio-economic and socio-cultural integration of ethnic minority youth; 3. Civic participation as the challenge of becoming an active citizen. The CA represents a high profile network which will work out the three thematic areas in workshops with other European experts on youth, researchers as well as policy makers and practitioners. It aims at integrating existing research, developing a new understanding of the youth question and at coming up with policy relevant recommendations. Each working group assembles researchers from different European countries, representing different youth transition regimes, including those of new EU member states and accession countries. The working groups specify the overall objectives and research questions in parallel as well as in integrated activities which look for interconnections between the topics. A course module 'Youth - actor of social change' for use in higher education will be developed while a European conference under the same title will highlight the findings of the Coordinated Action.",1,0
257,92141,No,Differences in European Legal Cultures: A Study on Dispute Agreements As a Form of Private Regulation,"The proposal focuses on dispute agreement as to evidence, qualification and interpretation. Those are increasingly relied upon by the parties, in consumer and business contracts in domestic and cross-boarder transactions. They provide for a private regulation and are meant to impose the solutions parties agreed upon in case of disputes as to the contract. The legal effect attach to these agreements differs among the major European jurisdictions. I will demonstrate that these differences reflect deeper, underlying differences in legal culture in the major European jurisdictions. The research will include 3 steps. First, a comparative and analytical enquiry as to the legal effects of dispute agreements (UK, France and Germany and EU Principles). The purpose of this phase is to show for each jurisdiction to what extent the parties are allowed to depart from the usual rules on dispute and, therefore, the depth and limits of the freedom granted to the parties to modify the power of the judge. Second, a synthetic analysis of the extent to which the limits to the enforceability of private regulation can provide evidence as to accepted deviation from the normal public judicial role. The interest of this analysis is to show the relationship between restrictions on freedom of contract and core cultural fundamental procedural principles (judicial impartiality, principle of fair trial, etc.). Third, an assessment of prospective changes on these issues in connection with the procedural principals directly or indirectly stated in international norms such as the European Convention of Human Rights. This step reaches out directly to European Private Law as such and contributes to its construction.. A guide on the comparative effect of dispute agreements is, per se, a useful tool for transactions’ security in Europe. The deeper analysis of the cultural reasons that account for differences is needed to anticipate further European legal harmonization.",1,0
566,191242,No,Critical transitions and self-organization in sleep micro-architecture,"Humans and animals exhibit brief awakenings from sleep (arousals), which are traditionally viewed as random disruptions of sleep caused by external stimuli or pathologic perturbations. However, our recent findings show that arousals represent previously unrecognized intrinsic aspects of sleep, and exhibit complex temporal organization and scale-invariant behavior characterized by a power-law probability distribution for their durations. In contrast, sleep-stage durations exhibit exponential behavior. The co-existence of these two very different processes in the sleep regulatory mechanism has not been observed in any other physiological system, and resembles a special class of non-equilibrium physical systems exhibiting self-organized criticality (SOC). Such organization of arousals makes it unlikely that they are merely a response to random stimuli, however, the role arousals play in healthy sleep and in sleep disorders remains unknown.  Since our preliminary analyses show that SOC-type dynamics persist throughout the sleep period in humans and across several mammalian species with different sleep architecture, we hypothesize that arousals are an integral part of healthy sleep and relate to basic neuronal interactions. To address this hypothesis we will combine human sleep data and bio-molecular/genetic animal experiments with modern approaches from statistical physics of non-equilibrium systems and the theory of complex networks. Our objective is to uncover basic principles of self-organization in sleep that would elucidate the interrelation between sleep-stage dynamics and arousals, and to derive novel and more sensitive diagnostic markers of sleep disorders.",0,0
2,111306,Yes,Multilevel governance of cultural diversity in a comparative perspective: EU-Latin America,"The overall aim of this proposal is to create a transnational interdisciplinary research and training network between European and Latin American Universities and Research centres in order to promote transfer of knowledge and to produce innovative research in the field of the multilevel governance of cultural diversity in a comparative perspective. The governance of cultural diversity is a key issue for contemporary Europe. Accommodating increased cultural diversity by balancing the recognition of differences with the promotion of equal participation in the common public sphere is a task that will, for the foreseeable future, be with us to stay. The proposal will represent a crucial moment for a stronger institutionalisation of the existing collaborations among the partner institutions, giving a systematic character to the transfer of knowledge on the issue of cultural diversity, through methodological workshops, which will clarify definitions and conceptualizations, through the implementation of   comparative research, the implementation of joint courses (Master programs, doctoral studies) and the launching of a scientific journal in English. The comparative research projects implemented will focus on the relations between, on one side, the institutional framework and the governments’ policies, and, on the other, the empirical dynamics of the cultural construction, social formation and political mobilization of collective identities, deployed by migrants, ethno-national minorities, religious minorities, indigenous peoples. The  proposal’s research outcomes will enable a better understanding of the complex dynamics in plural and multi-ethnic societies and may possibly suggest new paths for policies and governance at national and at EU-level.",1,1

Crime and violence perpetrated by mentally ill persons are now significant social problems throughout the European community. The costs of these crimes, both financial and human, are enormous. This problem has developed since the policy of deinstitutionalizing the mentally ill was implemented, despite the existence of extensive networks of health and social services. Some small scale experimental community treatment programmes have proven to be effective in preventing criminality and violence among high risk patients. It is urgent to extend these findings in order to develop humane policies and services that will prevent crime and violence among persons suffering from these disorders. Not only would such programmes improve quality of life generally by reducing crime rates, it would significantly improve the quality of life of mentally ill persons and reduce stigma against them. The present proposal describes a concerted action by scientists from a number of European countries to identify the specific aspects of treatments, services, and laws that are necessary to prevent crime among the mentally ill, to develop common tools for risk assessment, and for (relatively) non-invasive objective measures of medication use and alcohol and drug consumption.  OBJECTIVES: 1. To identify the components of mental health and social services provided to persons with major mental disorders that are associated with an absence of criminality and violence; 2. To discover if these components of services prevent crime among all types of patients with major mental disorders or among specific sub-groups of patients; 3. To measure the impact of varying legal powers of mental health professionals to require patients to participate in community treatment on the prevention of crime and violence; 4. To assess the predictive validity of the HCR-20 in determining the risk of violence among patients discharged to the community; 5. To assess the validity of hair analysis for measuring medication use and alcohol and drug consumption.  A large, multi-site comparative investigation is the only way to examine the interactions of various types of social and mental health services, patient characteristics, and legal contexts. Sites in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Canada have been selected. In each country, the out-patient services provided to two samples of patients following hospitalisation will be examined. Within each site, the forensic sample will be composed of patients who have been hospitalised because of a crime; the traditional psychiatric sample will be composed of patients matched for age, sex, illness, and age at first admission, history of alcohol and drug use, and history of aggressive behaviour who were hospitalised with no official designation of criminality. A great amount of effort will go into assuring that subjects recruited in the different countries are similar. Only in this way will the study be valid. 07",1,1
294,210577,No,New Buildings Energy Renovation Business Models incorporating dual energy services,"NOVICE will develop and demonstrate a new business model in building renovation to better monetize energy efficiency by consolidating services and subsequent revenue streams from both energy savings and demand response. In order to do so NOVICE introduces new actors (aggregators) in building energy upgrade projects and fosters their collaboration with ESCOs, financing institutions, facilities management companies, engineering consultants to facilitate the roll out of the dual (grid services and energy efficiency) energy services model. The main business bond to be forged between ESCOs and Aggregators through NOVICE will allow their seamless collaboration in exploiting economies of scope and scale along with risk sharing on implementing building energy renovations. That business relationship will take the form of a MoU and will result in the composition of a new enhanced EPC template that can deliver the successful deployment of the dual energy services scheme in building renovation. The enhanced EPC template and the overall dual energy services scheme will be scrutinized by a financing institution to assess its bankability and identify the appropriate financing mechanisms for initiating and rolling out investments under that scheme.  NOVICE throughout its duration targets to trigger the initiation of more than 20.8 m EUR of investments in building renovation based on the dual energy services model that will result in primary energy savings of more than 25.2 GWh/year. To achieve that target NOVICE brings together a highly experienced consortium that consists of stakeholders from the entire value chain (research institutions, technology vendors, engineering consultants and facilitators, Aggregators, ESCOs, Financing institutions, Facilities Management companies) of building renovation. Strong participation of SMEs (6 out 9 partners) demonstrate the commercial exploitation potential of the NOVICE outputs and supports the successful rollout of the NOVICE business model.",0,0
947,221725,No,Ultra-high field imaging of perceptual learning and human brain plasticity,"Learning and experience shape key cognitive functions of the adult human brain and support our ability to interact in complex and dynamic environments. Yet, the brain mechanisms that support our ability to learn from cluttered and inherently ambiguous sensory information and improve our perceptual decisions with training remain largely unknown. My proposal aims to investigate: (i) the neural basis of perceptual learning in the human visual cortex (ii) the neural computations that underlie perceptual learning and (iii) the brain connectivity (i.e. how different brain areas work together) that supports behavioural improvement due to training. To achieve this, I will combine behavioural paradigms measuring perceptual learning, ultra high-field 7T imaging of brain activations at the finer scale of laminar layers (i.e. across cortical depth) and state-of-the-art computational modelling. This integrated multidisciplinary approach will contribute significantly to our knowledge of how the brain optimises its capacity for adaptive behaviour through learning and experience. Further the proposed work has potential practical implications for the design of education and rehabilitation training programmes in life-long development and disease. Finally, this interdisciplinary research experience boosted by collaborations with industrial partners will benefit greatly my career development to an independent researcher in the field of computational cognitive neuroscience.",0,0

In order to offer interoperability of european e-purses, CEPS will be used as a basis for the financial solution. Marketing ad commercial sustainability will be ensured by implementing the contactless payment function on a multi application card to allow for multiple benefits for the end user. The technical feasability and concept will be proved by implementing the solution designed on one or several demonstrator.  Objectives: Considering the deployment of Smart Cards in the world, the two business sectors which are identified today as being crucial actors in the real development of smart card usage are transport and finance. The services delivered by these two sectors are daily used by the vast majority of European citizens on the one hand, and constitute a perfect target for adaptation onto a smart card on the other hand. This has already been recognized by the concerned organisations who are already doing their best to migrate to smart card technology.

716,69206,No,Les femmes dans la pêche et les Cultures marines en Europe,"The thematic network 'Femmes' intends to bring together research centres, fisherwomen association, representatives of maritime administration and social institutions to promote and co-ordinate in Europe fisherwomen initiatives to enhance the recognition of their status and role in fishing enterprises and in fishing communities. Network activities will cover issues related to the status and action of women in artisanal fisheries and shell fish culture. Thematic network aims to cover the following aspects: fisherwomen network development., internal and external exchanges through workshops, research popularisation and production of two agendas address to decision makers. One of this agenda will identify the main priorities on gender research and the second will cover women in action in fisheries sector. For the moment 5 countries are involved in the network. During the three year the network can be joint by others organisations working on theses issues.  Objectives The objectives of the network 'FEMMES ' are the following: - Establishing links between social sciences researchers working in the field of fisheries and aquaculture, the women involved in this sector, and the representative structures of fisherwomen organisations such as social institutions, administrations and training institutions, - Making an inventory of the initiatives already existing in this field in Europe, either fisher-women organisations or research actions, and providing a 'place for exchanges and reflections' at the European level, - Providing a preliminary opportunity in order to create a network of relationships between the fisherwomen organisations at the European level and initial contacts with similar networks in other sectors of activity, - Promoting within the field of social sciences the theme of research about women, from this reflection and through the identification of research lines to develop, - Making a preliminary assessment, in the form of discussion workshops between researchers and actors, of the role of women in this sector, and ensuring the communication and dissemination of information, including the popularisation of scientific research work.  Description of the work The network is initiated by researchers and fisherwomen. The network's co-ordination and administrative management (WP1) are under the responsibility of the Centre for the Law and Economics of the Sea (CEDEM) of the University of Western Brittany in France. A few institutions, mainly fisherwomen organisations and research institutions, have accepted to play a concrete role within the network as contractors or members. From this core, the network's vocation consists in integrating more and more people, either individually or on behalf of organisations. In order to conduct the debate a permanent secretary office for the network is created within the co-ordinator. A steering committee consisting of 3 scientists and 2 fisherwomen is formed to assist the co-ordinator in the management of the network. The activities of the network consist in two types of action : 1- the animation of discussion groups in a workshop format: The first year will be devoted to the discussion of the theme 'Women and Private Space' (WP2, two workshops) and the second year for the theme 'Women and Public Space' (WP3, two workshops). The contributions and discussions of the workshops will be published in proceedings in the form of two volumes widely distributed within the network and beyond. The network will produce agendas for decision-makers based on these discussions (WP6). These documents are an 'Agenda for research about women' and an 'Agenda for women action'. 2- cross actions that will be undertaken during all the 'life' of the network : One will consist in popularising research works in the area of fisheries through the production of synthesis sheets (WP4). The other will concern the inventory of all fisherwomen organisations existing in the Union, the design of a website, the edition of a biannual newsletter and the dissemination of the results of the network's activity (WP5).  A major function of the network will be to enhance communication among European fisherwomen organisations and between scientists and fisher-women. Attempt will be made to keep up with four working languages within all activities of the network: French, Spanish, Portuguese and English.  Milestones There are four milestones for the follow-up of the development of the network. The first step (M1) is the structuring of the network, during which all the functional structure should be set, including secretariat steering committee, website, newsletter, workshop and scientific synthesis methodology. Then the production of the proceedings of the first series of working groups ('Women in private space) will mark the capacity of the network to conduct the discussion up to a synthetic document for dissemination (M2). A third key milestone is the production of the agendas for decision-makers (M3) as the concluding step of two years of debate animation in the workshops. Finally, the capacity of the network to ensure it further development after the end of the initial funding will be crucial criteria to evaluate its results (M4).",1,0
890,57157,No,Signal MAnagement in Real Time for urban traffic NETworkS,"SMART NETS aims at enabling a significant improvement of the international state-of-the-art in real-time network-wide urban traffic control via application, demonstration, and comparative evaluation of the new-generation control strategy TUC (Traffic-responsive Urban Control). TUC employs advanced automatic control methodologies which may lead to improvements in the order of 40% of journey times as compared to fixed-time settings under saturated traffic conditions where all current signal control strategies are known to perform poorly. Within SMART NETS, TUC will be extended to consider public transport priority measures. The demonstration will be conducted in extended network parts of Southampton, Munich and Chania, and include field-comparisons with the current resident control methods (SCOOT, BALANCE, TASS). A successful completion of SMART NETS would mark a new era in urban traffic control worldwide, with substantial technological and economic impact for European ITS activities.  Work description: All current signal control strategies are known to be functionally decentralised and to perform poorly under saturated traffic conditions. TUC is genuinely network-wide and has been conceived to address traffic saturation in a highly efficient and elegant way. TUC is, at the same time, simpler than any other strategy and may be easily applied to any network via implementation of a generic software code, whereby the specifics of each application are incorporated in suitable input files to feed the software code. In a first project phase, TUC's control law will be designed in detail for each application site and will be exhaustively tested via simulation for various scenarios of demand, incidents, device failures etc. In parallel, public transport priority measures will be incorporated in TUC. Then, TUC will be implemented and demonstrated in each of the three cities over seven months, with weekly alternation of TUC and the current resident state-of-the-art signal control strategy (SCOOT, BALANCE, TASS respectively), to enable data collection under all occurring traffic conditions. Finally, the collected data will be used for the evaluation of TUC against the resident strategies. The evaluation will provide conclusive evidence on TUC's capabilities with regard to both quantitative (journey times, saturation levels, fuel consumption, cost-benefit ratio etc.) and qualitative criteria (simplicity, interoperability, user acceptance etc.). The targeted end result is a field-demonstrated breakthrough in terms of efficiency in saturated traffic conditions. Ten cities, five of them Capitals, are included in the project as Followers to form a User Board and to receive privileged information on the achieved results. Further activities will ensure wider dissemination of the project results including both scientific publications and information for city officers, for instance through the POLIS network.  Milestones: Main milestones are the design and simulation testing of TUC for the three sites; the inclusion of public transport priority in TUC; the field implementation and verification of the strategy in three sites; the field-demonstration, assessment, and comparative evaluation. Main expected result is the extended and conclusive field evidence of a breakthrough in the area of urban traffic control with targeted reduction of average journey times in the order of 40% under saturated traffic conditions.",0,0
378,79434,No,"Million frame per second, time-correlated single photon camera","Imaging of ultra-fast, time-correlated, molecular processes in physics and the life-sciences is placing increased demands on camera technology. A new detection paradigm is necessary whereby a solid-state sensor array of pixels sensitive to a single photon is assembled. Pixels composed of detectors called Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) will be integrated for the first time in an advanced, deep-submicron CMOS process. Large arrays of SPADs interfacing to networks of parallel digital processing units on the same chip will provide record levels of timing accuracy, sensitivity and speed. The MEGAFRAME 128x128 pixel prototype will be capable of a sustained 1,000,000 frames per second with 50 picosec time uncertainty. This will re-establish European excellence in the field of ultra-high speed video capture.   To access and process the extremely high data rates generated by the pixel array, novel system architectures must be developed. Another essential advance is a highly reproducible optical concentrator array to reclaim the fill-factor lost to pixel-level infrastructure.  The new imaging system will be evaluated using emerging time-correlated methods such as Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy and Correlation Spectroscopy, Forster Resonance Energy Transfer, and Voltage-Sensitive Dye imaging. Resolutions and frame rates at least ten times higher than today's solutions will be achieved. Mechanisms such as calcium signalling will be monitored on single cells at 1microsec steps for the first time. Future advances in proteomics, systems biology and drug discovery are dependent on such improved understanding of intra-cellular processes.  Major contributions to multi-processing architecture, flow-control engineering and fast phenomena observation are also expected.

1049,110072,No,Aggression subtyping for improved insight and treatment innovation in psychiatric disorders,"Aggression is a basic physiological trait with important roles throughout evolution, both in defence and predation. When expressed in humans in the wrong context, aggression leads to maladjustment, social impairment and crime. Despite this, knowledge about aggression aetiology is limited and current treatment strategies are insufficient. Contingent to a subdivision into impulsive and instrumental subtypes, we investigate the aetiology of maladaptive aggression in paediatric conduct disorders most strongly predisposing to pathological aggression, ADHD and conduct disorder, and in the general population. We employ highly innovative approaches in humans and animal models and maximize the output from the project by optimally balancing the use of large, existing data sets with new data acquisition. Through this, we build a knowledge chain from molecule to behaviour, investigating known and novel genes, gene-networks and their epigenetic interactions, and mapping their mode of action from the molecular via the cellular to the brain-circuit level. This is accompanied by highly powered analyses of the neural substrates of the aggression subtypes. Based on innovative bioinformatic multimodal data integration, our interdisciplinary research will lead to novel, accurate algorithms for reliable aggression prediction, which will be validated in existing longitudinal studies in children and tested for their predictive value in adult outcome. In addition to this approach towards prevention, we test promising non-pharmacological biofeedback for personalised treatment and prevention of overt aggression. For the identification of novel pharmacological compounds in aggression treatment, we introduce a new animal model, the zebrafish. The Aggressotype consortium is based on successful existing collaborations. It includes experts in childhood and adult psychiatry and research-intensive SMEs ensuring maximal dissemination, clinical implementation and business development opportunities.",0,0

Better regulation is a flagship policy on the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. Its aims are to provide new governance architectures for law-making, to increase the competitiveness of the regulatory environment, and to secure wide social legitimacy for multi-level systems of rules. Whilst most of the research has looked at how better regulation is changing, this project will produce findings on what has changed because of better regulation. Theoretically, the project will use (and significantly improve on) theories of policy learning. Empirically, it will cover Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the UK and the EU   including multi-level analysis and analysis by sector of regulation. Methodologically, the project will draw on comparative analysis of types of learning, experiments with regulatory policy-makers in six countries and the European Commission, large-n analysis of impact assessments, backward-mapping of legislation (to appraise the role played by better regulation in the formulation or laws in the UK and the EU), meta-analysis of case-studies and co-production of knowledge with better regulation officers.

390,200038,No,Securing Internet Routing from the Ground Up,"The Internet is made up of dozens of thousands of smaller networks, called Autonomous Systems (ASes), ranging from multinational corporations to small businesses and schools, e.g., Google, Deutsche Telekom, AT&T, and Hebrew U. Routing between ASes is handled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is the glue that holds the Internet together. Alarmingly, despite the Internet's critical societal and economic role, BGP routing is dangerously vulnerable to configuration errors and attacks, and, consequently, every year or so a major Internet outage makes the news.  To remedy BGP’s many security vulnerabilities, researchers and practitioners have invested much effort into designing security solutions for BGP routing. Yet, despite over a decade of Herculean efforts, many technological, political, and economic hurdles hinder, and possibly even prevent, deployment. I argue that the reasons for this are deeply rooted in today’s centralized, top-down, hierarchical paradigm for securing Internet routing. The aim of the planned research project is to put forth and explore a radically new paradigm for securing routing on the Internet. The proposed alternative roadmap for securing the Internet consists of two steps:  1) Jumpstarting BGP security: A novel approach to routing security that bypasses the obstacles facing today’s agenda. Specifically, the proposed design will be flat, decentralized, fully automated, avoid dependency on a single root-of-trust, and not require modifying/replacing legacy BGP routers.   2) A long-term vision for Internet routing: Leveraging the vast computational resources in modern datacenters, and research on Secure Multi-Party Computation, to outsource routing to a small number of entities while retaining flexibility, autonomy and privacy.  I believe that, put together, these can lead to a more secure Internet in the short-run, and outline a promising, yet uncharted, new direction for the future of Internet routing.",0,0

These EU-funded projects are based mainly on documentary surveys but the archaeological verification for seismic activity remains under-researched. The aim of ArMedEa is to develop the analysis of the physical impacts of earthquakes, tsunamis and landslide seismic-induced events during the later Middle Ages (defined here as 1000-1550 AD). This will be achieved at a European scale, adopting a specifically archaeological approach to collate and integrate information from a wide range of sources including standing buildings, buried stratigraphical sequences and palaeoenvironmental data.  This differs from current perspectives which tend to be driven largely from an earth science perspective. The main objectives of the project are: (a) the development of a geographical database for seismic events in the Middle Ages drawing on existing catalogues and untapped ‘grey literature’; (b) the investigation of a sample of well-documented episodes using a combination of remote sensing and fieldwork, and; (c) to understand the ‘risk-sensitive tactics’ adopted by medieval societies in different regions, such as their resilience and hazard reduction strategies.

84,217576,Yes,The Politics of Legitimacy: Non-partisan global governance and networked INGO power in the global governance of post-war states,"POLINGO maps, analyses and theorizes the contribution of informal interpersonal networks to shaping the policies, programmes, and approaches of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in the international governance of crisis areas, particularly post-war states. By accompanying, complementing or even contradicting institutional linkages between state and non-state agencies, interpersonal networks transcend and bypass the conventional divide between governmental and non-governmental organisations. Since INGOs predominantly rely on their reputations as independent, disinterested and impartial to be able to work in post-war states, these closely knit interpersonal networks between state and non-state institutions raise questions regarding the sources and construction of legitimate INGO authority and credibility in global governance. Despite the ubiquity of such informal interpersonal networks, there has not been any systematic attempt to study their role in shaping, enabling or transcending institutional structures and means of cooperation in the global governance of post-war states. POLINGO addresses this gap by combining a longitudinal Social Network Analysis (SNA) with two in-depth qualitative case studies. The project breaks new ground theoretically and empirically by studying the institutional and interpersonal/informal interfaces between non-state and state-based forms of power in global governance as summarized in the following overarching research question: How do interpersonal networks between state- and non-state agencies shape INGO practices and positions in the global governance of post-war states?",1,1
32,193623,Yes,Legal Architectures: The Influence of New Environmental Governance Rules on Environmental Compliance,"Non-compliance with the EU’s environmental rules is one of the key weaknesses of the EU’s environmental policy. This research investigates the influence that environmental governance laws have on compliance decisions, and how we might best design our laws to maximise compliance. One of the most important trends in European environmental regulatory techniques over the past decade has been the shift from hierarchical, state-led government via command-and-control techniques, to decentralised, society-led governance by local private actors (see, e.g., Jordan et al (2013)). The EU has strongly supported efforts to empower compliance and enforcement by non-State actors, as embodied in the UNECE Aarhus Convention and implementing laws. Yet little is known about how this major change in environmental governance laws has actually influenced compliance levels in practice, and why. Can the design of environmental governance rules influence us not only to comply with the letter of the law, but also to go further? This research seeks to fill that gap by means of an interdisciplinary, bottom-up study of the relationships between the legal architecture of environmental governance and compliance decisions, in a selected field of EU environmental policy (biodiversity), and in three selected States. It is novel in terms of theory, because it tests new hypotheses about the effects environmental governance rules have on compliance. It is novel in terms of methodology, because in testing these hypotheses, it uses techniques that have not up to now been applied to measure the effect of law. It is challenging, because it sits at the intersection between the law and economics, socio-legal and governance/regulatory literatures, and brings together multiple methods from these fields to test its hypotheses. It has potentially high impact, because non-compliance is one of the most serious problems the EU’s environmental policy faces, and is closely linked to environmental outcomes.",1,1
1032,213294,No,Polymeric nanocoating for tight and strong adhesion between challenging combinations of metals and plastics,"Radisurf developed an industrial and stable process to create an adhesive layer on metal surfaces to efficiently adhere plastic parts. This process is the first solution offering the possibility to join strongly metals and plastics trough an ultrathin and tight interface. The use of plastics adhered onto metals to take advantage of both types of materials is highly desired in specific applications, e.g. to prevent corrosion, reduce friction or weight, repel dirt, and increase the biocompatibility and safety of components. Metal-plastic joining is complex and challenging, and the quality and effectiveness of the joining methodology is of utmost importance, both for safety and economic reasons. Industries such as medical devices, electronics, automotive, design, off-shore, food/beverage machinary are continuously looking for cost-efficient strategies to combine dissimilar materials. RadiSurf aims to pursue a major opportunity in the adhesives market by targeting applications where there are no solutions available or the few existent exhibit inferior performance, or as replacement of complex and difficult methodologies (often too expensive) that do not satisfy completely the industries. The technology (patent pending) is capable to bond plastic to metal with properties and safety not reachable by any adhesive system currently available in the market. AdheSurf adhesive layer is processed in mild conditions and it is a clean process not requiring demanding conditions. AdeSurf technology will be highly competitive not only in terms of efficiency but also regarding costs – upon established in the customers production lines with minor adaptations, the quantity of consumables needed will be very low and most of the chemical may be re-used. With our solution, industries will have the opportunity to improve the quality of their products or even develop products with new designs or new combinations of metals and plastics.",0,0
549,199494,No,H2AD - Innovative and scalable biotechnology using Microbial Fuel Cell and Anaerobic Digestion for the treatment of micro-scale industrial and agriculture effluents to recover energy from waste,"Lindhurst Innovation Engineering (LIE) have developed H2AD - a novel micro-scale technology for the rapid and safe disposal of organic effluent. A hybrid of microbial fuel cells (MFC) and conventional anaerobic digestion (AD), H2AD is based on a patented bioreactor and electrode architecture.  H2AD enables a 10x reduction in the time required to reduce the organic content of waste, and recover the energy via conversion to a hydrogen/methane rich biogas.  Effluent disposal has been identified by LIE as a key restriction on the productivity and profitability of the EU agri-food and drink processing industry (a-FDPI), which is the largest EU manufacturing industry but includes 271,000 micro and small enterprises (µSE). No viable micro-scale technology currently exists for disposal of effluents from µSE, or is able to recover energy from these waste volumes. However, currently at TRL6/7 through extensive testing on cattle slurry, H2AD can also directly address the challenge of waste management in the a-FDPI, recovering some of the 288TWh of potential energy lost in effluent from the EU a-FDPI annually. The overall aim of the Phase 2 project is to undertake the experimental development and field trials required to confirm predicted H2AD performance/payback for new feedstocks, derived from the a-FDPI. LIE seek to prove commercial viability for efficient removal of organic content from key process waste streams; slurry; and post-AD liquors, with biogas utilisation strategies for optimum payback. The project seeks to develop sensing for automated/remote control of system operation and optimised biogas yields through process performance.  Strong collaboration with EU industrial and academic bodies directly open opportunities for the placement of 600 units in the a-FDPI, as well as a further 14,000 applications in primary agriculture and waste management, in line with LIE’s commercial strategy for H2AD to address the €34 billion global market for waste-to-energy equipment.",0,0
863,185536,Yes,"‘Freedom, dignity and justice’: A comprehensive approach to the understanding of youth exclusion and the prospects for youth inclusion and overall change in the South and East Mediterranean","The 2010-2011 youth-led wave of protests in the South and East Mediterranean, could be described as the coming on the scene of a new generation united by a shared experience of marginalisation and by new ways to protest and act. Important as this phenomenon could be for the future of the SEM, it still escapes the main frames of analysis utilised by academic research. Youth studies in the SEM, while producing important findings and insights, have failed so far to give a multi-dimensional and comprehensive understanding of the economic, political and social disadvantages faced by youth in the region and of the possible evolution of young people’s role in national or regional developments. This project aims at filling this important gap in our knowledge of the SEM by offering a comprehensive multi-level, interdisciplinary and gender-sensitive approach to the understanding of youth in the region. By combining the economic, political and socio-cultural spheres and a macro (policy/institutional), meso (organisational) and micro (individual) level analysis, POWER2YOUTH will explore the root causes and complex dynamics of youth exclusion, while investigating the factors fostering youth inclusion. Building on a conceptualisation of youth that gives prominence to youth as potential agents of change, the project starts out from the assumption that youth exclusion is the result of unequal power relations in society, in as much as effective youth inclusion can only be fostered by a bottom-up process of transformation of the systemic inequalities that lead to exclusion in the first place. From this premise comes the project’s emphasis on the study of the potentially transformative impact of individual and collective youth agency searching for instances of empowerment leading to active youth participation in society and overall change.  POWER2YOUTH will finally produce innovative and concrete policy recommendations.",1,1
570,54104,No,Productivity Engineering for innovative Production Technologies by Knowledge-Based Service Networks,"PRESERVE will design and implement a service knowledge network supporting a production system consisting of machines linked in a production chain. Due to the enormous requirements towards availability and a lack of experience concerning the innovative technology used, the system operating company and the machine suppliers will establish a knowledge partnership to control productivity. The network consists of an organisational network, an information and communication infrastructure and a qualification concept based on knowledge exchange and accessibility for all partners. PRESERVE will develop organisational concepts for networked service and maintenance. This new form of co-operation will be supported by an IT infrastructure based on Internet technologies enabling a structured process of knowledge management and providing software for remote maintenance. The core of the infrastructure will be a multimedia service and maintenance database.  Objectives: The overall objective of PRESERVE is to raise the availability of innovative and complex production technologies by installation of an international knowledge-network comprising the operating company and the suppliers. The project aims at improving the service co-operation when a machine malfunction occurs or when preventive measures to maintain the system have to be carried out. The knowledge-network aims at increasing the accessibility of information, simplification of information search and documentation, increasing the ability of self-service and accelerating the process of organisational learning. It will be supported by a multimedia knowledge database accessible over the Internet containing all relevant service and maintenance information. The new methods, software tools and organisational co-operation concepts will be tested in a production environment with a simple, measurable and precisely defined goal: increasing the availability of innovative production technologies.  Work description: The work is divided into 7 work packages: analysis, conception, development, integration and test, dissemination and implementation, project management and assessment and evaluation.  Analysis: In this package, the scientific and technological state of the art concerning service networks and the existing service organisation and techniques used in the partner enterprises are established. A benchmark study examines service and maintenance strategies in other branches. Service knowledge sources and existing qualifications are identified. Service and maintenance relevant controlling figures used in the partner companies are assessed.  Conception: In this packages, new concepts of organisation, communication, information technology, qualification and production controlling are created and adopted to the special needs of the partners. The knowledge base concept is set up by knowledge engineering. Assisting software tools are designed. More expressive controlling figures are worked out. Concepts for the introduction of the new organisation structures, the software and the controlling means are created.  Development: Here, the software modules used to assist process control, communication and remote maintenance are developed.  Integration and test: Software modules and service organisation concepts are installed at the partner companies. The staff is trained to use the new methods and software. All concepts and the software are refined by on-the-job testing.  Dissemination and Implementation: In this package, the project results are summarised in a guide, describing the organisation of service networks for linked machines with productivity guarantee. A business plan is set up to capitalise the project results after project duration.  Project management: This work packages which lasts from the beginning of the project to the end, assures the achievement of the project objectives by a regular revision process. Project meetings are held, external experts are invited and means for assuring constant communication are established.  Assessment and Evaluation: This work package will ensure that the project objectives will be reached by an on-going comparison of objectives set up in chapter 2 and the achieved project results. An assessment report will be provided to the project management board on a regular basis.",0,0
921,217445,No,CB1-18 Chatbot tool for automatic job interview,"CB1-18 is a computer program which is able to conduct a job interview automatically via auditory video and textual methods. It is able to interview all the applicants with questions in an automatic way. Our system can first verify the professional skills with questions about the candidate’s information about the applicant’s professional career and then verify the skills through language test and soft skills test. The main goal is to do almost all the selection process in an automatic way in order to avoid wasting time, and leaving to humans only the final decision. Most of the applications stand the chance of not being read due to time and cost reasons. The majority of them are rejected even before being read because of discriminatory criteria such as age, race, gender. Applicants don’t stand a chance in such a large amount of applications even before being evaluated on their skills basis. Other applications are rejected because of the way applicants writes since their CV is not able to transfer their value. Such software will help the most vulnerable people, generally discriminated by age - gender and race, to highlight their skills and willingness towards a fairly competition where all candidates start at the same starting point regardless of their status. There are so many areas of application: we think about people over 50 who have lost their job and the possibility to be selected again.

597,87764,No,Implementation of Membrane Technology to Industry,"The IMeTI proposal aims to create a programme of applied research for implementation of membrane technology into industry based on experience and knowledge transfer between Academia and Industry. New membranes with improved chemical stability in a wide range of solvents, and better controlled cutoff properties and commercially viable membranes with high selectivity and flux for gas separations will be developed. The overall scientific and technical aim of the IMeTI project is to make important paradigm shifts in organic solvent nanofiltration and high temperature gas separation/purification, using cutting edge technologies based on membranes. The project involves the integration of the invention of new membranes and applications in the University/ Research Institute Partners with the subsequent development of the necessary membrane technology up to processing scale by the SMEs. A key feature of this project will be the interdisciplinary nature of the Partners, and the fact that they bring inter-sectorial competence to the network. We aim to create widely applicable, scalable, high performance process techniques and technologies.  The knowledge transfer and training programme involves Early Stage Researchers (ESR), at both university and industrial partners, each of whom gain high quality experience through combination of local and network wide research experience. Experienced Researchers (ER) will provide in depth knowledge, and will assist in mentoring the ESR. Visiting scientists will provide expertise from outside the network. In addition to their individual research, ESR and ER will increase their research capacity and knowledge through attendance of high level research conferences and workshops.

602,6207,No,Plant molecular genetics for an environmentally compatible agriculture,"The EU Biotechnology Programme (1992-94) work programme invited applications for the establishment of Projects of Technology Priority (PTP) that would secure added value for European R&D activities by helping participants in complementary projects covering different technologies of the EU supported research programme to coordinate their activities around specific objectives. The PTP project 'Plant Molecular Genetics for an Environmentally Compatible Agriculture' was therefore conceived and implemented by AMICA to provide more scientific knowledge relevant to an environmentally sustainable agriculture, a topic of importantance for all of the member states as well as helping to enhance the continued competitiveness of European agriculture and related industries in the global market place. The project was established as a large multi-thematic programme, concentrating the scientific work programme around 15 research themes, and three local training involving 130 collaborating research teams from 11 member states. In fulfilment of the Biotechnology work programme, AMICA installed high levels of internal organisation to promote the development of the R&D infrastructure, the allocation of tasks to individual participants, the inclusion of training activities, and support to deserving groups penalized by geographic or academic isolation. Detailed final reports from each of these transnational, multidisciplinary collaborating groups of laboratories are contained elsewhere in this report. In addition to organising and managing the scientific programme of the PTP, AMICA instigated a range of management tasks which were inherent to the successful execution of the project. This PTP coordination overview will concentrate on these modalities, and highlight how added value and other benefits were realised, as well as noting some of the major scientific breakthroughs achieved during the contractual period. Scientific Highlights The breeding of plants for a more efficient, useful and environmentally compatible agriculture depends on creating plants with different growth habits, the ability to withstand better environmental stresses created by temperature and chemical variation, better abilities to sequester fertilisers from soils and better quality fruits and seeds for industrial processing and nutrition. The PTP has made many discoveries to enrich the fast growing pool of information that industries will use to breed new versions of crops with these improvements. Examples of some outstanding scientific success stories are detailed below: (i) Modern breeding has given us high yielding hybrids, e.g. of maize (by crossing of some highly inbred lines). This phenomenon, known as heterosis, is well known but poorly understood. This programme attempts to correlate the capacity for high yield with the activity, or lack thereof, of certain genes. (ii) That plant pathogenic bacteria harbour hrp (host resistance and pathogenicity) genes, some of which are highly conserved and related to genes found in animal pathogens and therefore renamed hrc (c for conserved), is not only very intriguing but the comparison also strengthens the idea that these genes are involved in a mechanism allowing the injection in the plant of chemical signals coming from the pathogenic bacteria. The importance of this work is to be measured in a medium to long-term time frame. (iii) Plants have evolved regulated growth systems to compete with each other for sunlight. In agriculture this is not always advantageous. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing an oat PHYA gene have now been produced and shown to exhibit negative shade avoidance characteristics with reduced extension growth of stems and petioles when grown in close proximity to other plants. This manipulation of crop plant architecture has resulted in an significant increase in leaf biomass. Field trials have been carried out to advance this discovery. (iv) The correct timing of flower formation and appropriate flower structures are a vital determinant of seed yield. Consequently flowering is being studied in detail. A gene involved in flower development has been isolated from barley. Remarkably this gene (Tumbra) shows similarity to tumour genes from humans and mice. The expression of this gene is connected to tumorous growth in plants indicating similarities between the growth of tumours in both plants and animals. The gene may be useful to help control plant cell proliferation and differentiation in plant propagation regimes. (v) It is well known that steroids play a major influence on the development of animals. Through the analysis of a T-DNA insertion mutant of Arabidopsis affected in its growth, as well as its reactions to light, PTP research has demonstrated that certain ecdysone-like steroids (brassinosteroids) also play a major role in the regulation of a wide range of agriculturally important traits in plants (growth, defense mechanisms and reactions to light). (vi) Plant growth is regulated by hormones such as ethylene. Manipulation of responses to hormones depends on defining the genes and pathways associated with the ethylene growth response. Studies have now demonstrated that binding of ethylene to its receptor within the plant, results in the activation of a small protein termed a G-protein. It has also been shown that the treatment of plants with ethylene leads to the initiation of a 'phosphorylation cascade' that activates steps that eventually change plant behaviour. Such observations have great significance because the small G-protein/phosphorylation cascade systems are known to be central to the control of many aspects of metabolism and development in yeast and animals, including humans. This is supported by the fact that 80% of human cancers are thought to be due to malfunctions of genes encoding small G-proteins. The plant discovery opens up ways of manipulating many aspects of plant architecture and responses. (vii) Xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XGOs) are natural plant growth regulators. PTP research has shown that XGOs promote plant growth by 'plasticising' cell walls, induce the production of ethylene, and can move from one part of the plant to another. This knowledge is confirming these molecules as powerful initiators of changes in plant growth patterns. PTP supported work has also demonstrated how a recently discovered enzyme, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, which plays a major role in XGO action, acts in living plant cells to modify XGO structures. (viii) A dream of plant breeders is to be able to disrupt specific genes and replace them with new versions. This has so far proved very inefficient in higher plants. Work using Physcomitrella patens as a model species has demonstrated for the first time efficient gene disruption in plants. Disruption of genes encoding adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and the chlorophyll a/b binding protein has been achieved. Gene targeting permits the possibility of disrupting the activity of genes in order to ascertain their precise function - something vital for the research community in this era of gene discovery. (ix) Proteins and compounds such as certain sugars or amino acids derivatives are thought to exert a synergistic effect in protecting plant cells from irreversible damage caused by different abiotic stresses. In determining how the synthesis of these compounds is regulated the PTP has identified a barley protein that is synthesised in response to cold stress. It is a useful marker for breeders to measure cold tolerance. To discover valuable genes in protecting plants against stress many Arabidopsis mutants have been isolated with altered cold acclimation and freezing tolerance. By inserting specific genes plants with a modified response to heat shock have been made. These are significant advances towards the provision of crop plants with better resistance to common stresses limiting agricultural production. (x) In order to understand how plants respond to potassium (K\) deficiency and high salinity, PTP has characterised the pathways by which plants take up K\ and Na\. It has identified enzymes within the cell that are particularly sensitive to Na\ and show that Na\ sensitive metabolic systems are involved in intracellular signalling and regulate the pathway of active Na\ excretion under high salinity. (xi) To modify the ability of plants to withstand drought stress, it is relevant to understand which genes respond to drought to provide protection. Sixteen have been identified in maize in the PTP project and mapped on the maize genome to explore their coincidence with drought-linked loci detected by classical genetic mapping. Also decreases in invertase have shown to be an important early response to mild water stress. (xii) Significant advances have been made in the analysis of starch synthesis in the potato tuber with the identification of proteins involved in determining the structural features of starch. Potato plants with modified starches have been produced by manipulation of genes encoding the proteins. This information can be applied by industry to produce specific starch types suited to the needs of specialised end-users. (xiii) In an attempt to produce 'nutrient-dense foods' the PTP has been looking into how to increase the amounts of carotenoids in certain food crops. Many appropriate genes that can be introduced into plants in order to increase the amounts and types of carotenoids have been identified. Transformation of tomato with carotenoid biosynthesis genes from bacteria has been accomplished to make tomatoes with novel carotenoids. Also our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms in plants that control the level of these pigments in plant tissues has been increased. (xiv) Bacterial genes specifying fructans have been inserted into sugar beet and plants created that synthesise fructans. This discovery opens up new commercial potential for fructan production in this crop. (xv) Major genetic factors regulating kernel development and the utilisation of nitrogen in cereals have been identified to aid improved seed production. (xvi) An important objective for agriculture is to optimise the uptake of NO3 fertiliser to enable different fertiliser regimes to be practised. Genes for membrane proteins that are likely components of the high affinity nitrate uptake system of barley have been isolated. The equivalent genes have also been identified from other plant species which will enable scientists to improve the efficiency in which crop plants capture nitrate from the soil. (xvii) The identification of the high affinity transporters for nitrate opens the way to devise transgenic plants more efficiently taking up nitrate from the soil. This can be envisaged as a strategy to reduce the needs in nitrate fertilisers for major crops. (xviii) Plants constitutively expressing nitrate reductase are less susceptible to water stress-induced depression of nitrate assimilation. This also can contribute to devise plants requiring less nitrate for their sustained growth in semi arid conditions. (xix) Research carried out by one of the local training networks has resulted in the development of cDNA probes that can determine the developmental phase of tree material, which will act as a valuable tool in, (i) selection of tree material for micropropagation and (ii) determination of phase status prior to rooting and weaning. The PTP has also played an important role in helping to integrate the activities of geographically isolated groups with the rest of the European plance sceince community. As a direct result of the integrated collaboration between the Irish network and PTP Scientific Programme, the first European technology transfer meeting in plant biotechnology Phytosfere '97, was successfully held at University College Dublin. This meeting was a collaborative effort between AMICA, PIP, BioResearch Ireland and University College Dublin. (xx) As a consequence of the fruitful cooperation established between researchers in Portugal and the other members of the PTP, and of the expertise acquired in plant molecular biology, several papers are being prepared. A confidential abstract to discuss the possibility patenting of one gene sequence has been submitted to the Plant Industrial Platform.",0,0

The key question being addressed is: how can the powerful concepts of high-index-contrast nanophotonics be combined with the extreme accuracy of silicon technology and with the performance of hybrid silicon/III-V integration in order to create system-on-chip functionalities for advanced (bio-)spectroscopy. We will first focus research on integrated lasers or Laser Systems-on-Chip (LaSOC’s) capable of providing very wide wavelength tuning in the infrared, mid-infrared or visible. These lasers will have an unprecedented combination of properties. They will differ from existing semiconductor lasers in the sense that they combine the best of III-V semiconductor technology and silicon technology in unique cavity structures exploiting high index contrast in three dimensions. In the second phase of the project we will shift the focus from laser-oriented novelty to spectroscopy-oriented novelty and investigate SpecSOC’s with an unprecedented system performance that matches the requirements of mainstream real-life spectroscopy. We will explore coherent optical detection techniques for sensitivity enhancement, microporous coatings for on-chip gas sensing and implant-oriented tissue spectroscopy. Our research will lead to a paradigm shift in laser spectroscopy, in the sense that it will turn an advanced spectroscopy system into a small form-factor commodity system. This will have an enormous impact on applications such as point-of-care medical diagnosis and medical implants, monitoring of air, water and food quality. Furthermore the on-chip spectroscopy systems will be highly valuable for fundamental research.",0,0
42,221945,Yes,"Forms of Labour: Gender, Freedom and Experience of Work in the Preindustrial Economy","The history of labour and its role in Europe’s preindustrial development has very largely been the history of adult men. FORMSofLABOUR seeks to put other workers in the picture, particularly women and servants, not simply by ‘adding them on’ but by showing how a full understanding of women’s work and of service offers a radical critique of existing approaches to work and to the idea of free labour. It focuses on England in the period 1300-1700 viewed in a comparative Western European perspective, and addressed these issues through three themes. (1) A revolutionary research technique which collects evidence of work tasks from court records to simulate a time-use study is used to explore the experience of work. This technique allows the work activities of women and men, young and old, employees and family members to be illuminated, with evidence of tasks, location and timing of work, creating an entirely new perspective on England’s early modern economy. (2) The theoretical underpinnings of the history of women’s work in the preindustrial economy are explored, reassessing key debates using interdisciplinary perspectives from economics and political science, as well as new archival evidence from themes 1 and 3. Gendered work patterns are viewed through the lens of freedom, rather than patriarchy, to create a step-change in our understanding of gender and work. (3) The issue of the extent to which labour was ‘free’ after the end of serfdom is interrogated through a careful examination of the range of forms of labour and the nature of labour laws, using a variety of archival evidence combined with a comparisons with serfdom and slavery, and the adoption of insights from development economics and anthropology. Together these interlocking themes create a new history of work in the economy which formed the background to grand narratives of Smith and Marx, arguing that with women and servants had been in picture, the story of economic development is transformed.",1,1
598,61032,No,Additional of Russian node to European Cultural Heritage Applications Network,"CULTIVATE-Russia will establish a Russian ad-hoc National Node within CULTIVATE, the European Cultural Heritage Network consisting of 15 partners based in 12 European countries. This network continues the successful and fruitful work carried out by the National Focal Points for the Telematics for Libraries Programme under the Third and Fourth Framework Programmes and will expand it to all memory institutions, namely archives, museums and galleries. Since no Russian National Focal Point existed for the Telematics for Libraries Programme under the Third and Fourth Framework Programmes, it is important to establish a formal National Node which Russian cultural organisations can turn to for assistance and information on national and European matters and which can assist EU partners.  Objectives: CULTIVATE-Russia will: - Establish the Russian Cultivate node with input and support of all the major stakeholders (ministries and professional groupings) to discharge the functions described below - Create a communication channel between memory institutions in Russia and their counterparts in the CEE and EU countries and with the IST Programme of the European Commission - Raise awareness of the IST Programme for the development and use of cultural heritage applications - Encourage appropriate Russian participation in the IST Programme  Work description: CULTIVATE-Russia will form part of the CULTIVATE network, extending its coverage to include more than 140 million citizens of Russia. CULTIVATE-Russia will establish a Cultural Heritage Network in Russia, setting up a node to work with those established in the EU and CEE countries by CULTIVATE-EU and CULTIVATE-CEE. Like the nodes in other countries, the Russian node will seek representation from all relevant memory institutions in Russia (libraries, archives, museums, publishers [traditional and electronic]). As part of the wider CULTIVATE network, Cultivate-Russia will aim to use the common infrastructural resources maintained by CULTIVATE-EU (web-page, documents database, e-list, etc.), whilst remaining able to adapt them and add value according to Russian needs and circumstances. Because of the significant sharing of infrastructure envisaged with the rest of CULTIVATE network, CULTIVATE-Russia will run for 18 months only.

933,194590,No,"Social Exclusion of Youth in Europe: Cumulative Disadvantage, Coping Strategies, Effective Policies and Transfer","Against the background of increasing labour market insecurities among youth during the recent crisis, the aim of this interdisciplinary and internationally comparative project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of youth labour market vulnerability for risks of social exclusion in Europe. A multidimensional dynamic perspective on both objective and subjective dimensions of the social exclusion of young people is adopted in order to identify the complex interrelationships and potential risks of cumulative disadvantages and possible compensatory mechanisms. Specifically, implications of labour market insecurities for youth’s risks of poverty and material deprivation, their subjective well-being and health status as well as their ability to reach independence from parental home are investigated in a mixed-method approach. First, qualitative interviews are conducted with youths from nine selected European countries including Ukraine in order to reach an in-depth understanding of how disadvantaged youths perceive their social situation and try to cope with it in different economic, institutional and cultural environments. Second, quantitative methods are applied using EU-28 and national micro-data in order to identify the causal interrelationships and dynamic processes of youth’s social exclusion in different national contexts. Third, the diffusion and effectiveness of EU and national policies that address various issues of youth social exclusion are assessed in EU-28 based on expert interviews and policy evaluation analyses. A central objective of this comparative project is to learn about examples of best practises and provide suggestions for reforms and policies that help improving the social situation of young people who face labour market insecurities and also involve youth own voice in this process. By involving and addressing different stakeholder groups at all stages of the project the dissemination of results will be ensured.",1,0
532,24432,No,Optical inspection system for the measurement of three dimensional shapes,"The integration of high precision 3D-shape measurements of workpieces into a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) production line will be of increasing importance within the next few years. Although various potentially well-suited optical measuring techniques have been developed they suffer considerable constraints with regard to the range of measurement, the measuring time, the flexibility with respect to different workpieces and their overall cost. These problems which have prevented the economic introduction of such systems into a CIM environment can in principle be solved by the use of a modular, computer-aided system architecture. In order to obtain the utmost versatility as a key to low cost solutions both software and hardware will have a modular system structure and the measuring techniques will provide both comprehensive topographic 3-D shape information and the required resolution, measuring range and dynamics.   The objective of the project is to determine the feasibility of a modular, computer-aided 3D-shape inspection system within a CIM environment, thereby taking into account the application of the inspection system in industry together with the industrial requirements and specifications.   The inspection system shall make use of optical topographic measuring techniques. Two classes of workpieces to be measured shall be considered, mainly made from metal, ceramics and plastics: objects with diameters of up to 100 mm to be measured with an accuracy between 0.5 um and 2 um and objects with diameters of up to 1000 mm to be measured with an accuracy between 2 um and 100 um.   In order to determine which optical techniques are most suitable for such an inspection system a literature study and a theoretical analysis of techniques based upon the moire principles, diffraction pattern techniques, opto-mechanical scanning and sampling techniques will be carried out in the first part of the project (6 months). This shall be followed by an experimental study (6 months) to clarify possible remaining questions.   Status:  In progress.",0,0

The focus will be on the European regulatory framework for fostering innovation with the aim of enhancing Europe’s capacity for innovation-based sustainable economic growth.   The longstanding European Intellectual Property Institutes Network (EIPIN), a consortium of leading research and training centres in the area of intellectual property, is the driving force behind the project.  The primary research objective of the programme is to provide political leaders and stakeholders reliable conclusions and recommendations in the form of doctoral IP research on how to deal with the adaptive complexities of innovation cycles that secure economic benefits and uphold justice in the innovation society.  The training objectives of the programme focus on the development of ESR’s capacity to guide inventors and entrepreneurs in the life-cycle of IP-intensive assets and the process of translating intangible inventions into commercially viable products. The programme provides for an unprecedented environment for ESRs, based on the award of a joint or double doctoral degree.  The project results will be disseminated in a way that it has an impact on the norm-setting at the national, European and international level. The involvement of industry associations representing numerous undertakings multiplies the engagement of non-academic actors. Furthermore, the realisation of this ambitious interdisciplinary programme open to ESRs from all domains of sciences will provide a solid foundation for further cross-cutting research in the area of innovation policies, overcoming traditional divisions between faculties and disciplines.

132,39090,Yes,Self-employment activities concerning women and minorities: their s uccess or failure in relation to social citizenship policies,"The project focuses on the evaluation of social citizenship policies in relation to self- employment activities implemented by member countries of the European Union (EU).   Our resarch consists of comparative case studies in six European countries, in northern and in southern Europe. We will concentrate on the study of four metropolitan regions, i.e., the Rhein/Main Region in Germany, Athens in Greece, Stockholm for Sweden, and London for the UK. In Denmark, the semi-metropolitan region of Aalborg and Aarhus will be the research site. In Italy we will examine the self-employment activities in the semi-rural region of Calabria.   In this research, we will examine those policies aiming to promote self-employment as prominent active social integration strategies targeted to women and minority groups.   The comparative analysis of empirical data collected in six EU member states of good and bad practices of policies that have supported or hindered successful self-employment will be conducted through a methodology of successive case studies.   Our research is founded upon the explicit hypothesis that active social integration policies aiming at the promotion of self- employment of unemployed women and migrant minority members can only be successful if their specific socialisation under unstable biographical and work conditions is recognized and compensation is provided for their discontinuous working careers. These deficits are hypothesized as the principle cause also of business failure and require interventions.   The empirical methodology of this project will challenge this hypothesis through the systematic collection of life-histories and work-histories from samples of women and migrants who are most likely to be threatened by exclusion and, at the same time, have shown a strong motivation to self-employment through participation in programmes geared to active social integration. We will match these samples with samples of migrants and women who have become successfully self-employed without the benefit of these programmes and policies. Through this challenge testing of our hypothesis, we aim finally to formulate concepts for effective social policies related to efforts of members of socially vulnerable groups. These efforts to 'create a job for themselves' exploit the resources and potentials of individuals and of local regional structures to overcome social exclusion.",1,1
656,16502,No,Just In Time Open Learning,"Purpose   The motivation for the project came from a synergy between two quite distinct perspectives:    Neurope Lab had been established on an advanced technology international business park to examine industrial needs for knowledge management and access, leading towards a better understanding of learning organisations;   at Lancaster University, a model to capitalise on information and communications technologies (ICT); had been defined to meet a perceived governmental need to increase knowledge transfer between universities and industry.   From this background, the purpose of undertaking the work was to experiment with variants of the model to support the professional development of those working in enterprises in various parts of Europe with varying cultural and socio-economic origins.   There was also a dissatisfaction with approaches to training using ICT purely as a delivery mechanism and the implicit assumption that the pan-European scale would make such approaches a cost-effective means to meet widely accepted training needs.  JITOL developed a conceptual framework to support a learning organisation. The project produced a methodology, called 'reification', to classify and store contextual knowledge that evolved during interaction among professional peers. Thus, a constantly evolving knowledge base for the professional group was developed. The project provided a method to help professionals explicitly define the knowledge in their professional experience, formalise it, share it with their community. Furthermore it helped them acquire and develop new knowledge and be given credit for their new knowledge.  It also developed an implementation package, including both software and methodology to run the JITOL system in a variety of domains. The concept involves a 'four windows' computer interface to Lotus Notes as a metaphor for professional interactive and knowledge requirements. JITOL reports and documentation provided evidence of users' acceptance, pedagogical effectiveness, costs, technological, socio-legal and other barriers, together with guidelines for good practice. They have made important contributions to the actual implementation of the concept of a learning organisation. Approach   The project focuses on the development and evaluation of IT-based learning environments to support the professional development of individuals. There is commitment to, and strength drawn from, capitalising on the contextual expertise and skill of these professionals. We use the term 'communities of practice' to describe a grouping of people who work in similar jobs and have common job-related interests. A central goal therefore is to explore ways in which ICT can stimulate and support the exchange and collaborative sharing of expertise between professionals who may be in different organisations and between professionals within the same organisation, the latter leading towards the building of learning organisations.   Whilst in some of the JITOL experiments there will be traditional learner/tutor roles, and in any community there will be those who are looked upon as 'gurus' the JITOL environment is one in which roles may be blurred and interchangeable. The thrust of the experiments is to explore ways in which peer interaction leads to creative knowledge exchange.   The JITOL experiments begin with robust, stable communications technologies (electronic mail, computer conferences). However, work is being undertaken to develop new mechanisms and tools including hypermedia; knowledge bases and affordable multi-media communication. All the communication takes place asynchronously, that is without the need for the participants to be engaged at the same time as in a telephone conversation.   In order to achieve the functionality required, the project is building on existing software tools and developing new ones to be integrated in an overall architecture which can be represented by the diagram below.   A major innovative element in the project relates to the rapidly changing and informal nature of shared knowledge. Whilst there will be some traditional, formalised knowledge in the system, the emphasis is on the contextual knowledge which evolves during the peer interactions. Hence, although the initial interaction between peers may be stimulated by a formal knowledge base, the experiments will examine ways in which the expertise made explicit during the interactions can be captured and transformed into knowledge which is progressively incorporated into an evolving knowledge base. In the project, this process is referred to as 'reification'.   Outcomes   The project expects to produced outputs of two kinds:    methodologies   tools   The production of both of these will contribute to basic theories related to human development and knowledge engineering.   A major methodological contribution will be that concerned with the evaluation of methods of ICT use to support human development (including what are traditionally termed education and training). It is hoped that these methodologies and the tools which allow the methods to be implemented will augment contributions from other DELTA projects resulting in a broad base for assessing the value of ICT applications.   A second contribution is expected to be in a better understanding of the process of knowledge reification.  The experience of context-based efforts to synthesize the traces of human-human interaction arising in computer conferences, followed by the validation of the resulting knowledge objects, will demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Associated with this are expected to be context-focused, mechanisms for creating new knowledge structures moving beyond current views of predefined hypermedia links to ones which are dynamic and can be personalised.   A further contribution is that which will define more clearly and operationally the infrastructure requirements of an ICT-supported open-learning service provider. It may be helpful to consider two functions for a service provider:    domain expertise   infrastructure and knowledge engineering skills.   For example, an institution of higher education may provide both of these, whereas a corporate training unit may provide the former being assisted, at least initially, in the latter by an independent research and development agency. Within the project various forms of this provision are a part of the experimental implementations.   Impact   The strong domain contextual basis of the JITOL approach leads naturally to an expectation of vertical market implementations. In theory any such market or focus of expertise could become engaged in using Jitol-like infrastructures. Within the project, the experiments are being carried out in one aspect of banking, in support for field engineers in a large multinational corporation, for knowledge exchange amongst specialist medics, and learning technology training specialists in SMEs.   The project will have been successful if it is possible to define effective functionality for a service provider and to be able to identify features of knowledge exchange and training needs which can be satisfied by a particular implementation of the JITOL model.",0,0
541,32004,No,Environmental Forecasting for the Effective Control of Traffic,"The objective of the project is to predict poor local air quality in real time and then to initiate effective traffic demand management measures to reduce pollution levels in particular problem areas.  This will be achieved through establishing Local Environmental Management Boards, and integrating air quality models with real-time information on traffic flows, pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions, and thereby identifying pollution 'hotspots'. The traffic demand management strategies will be designed to reduce the pollution levels at the hotspot. The demand management tools include Variable Message Signs and traffic messages broadcast on FM radio digitally using RDS-TMC.

742,195836,No,Global and local star formation with state-of-the-art physics,"New stars form within large turbulent complexes harboring several thousands of solar masses of cold gas: the molecular clouds. The diffuse gas collapses gravitationally and heats up via compression until nuclear fusion reactions ignite and the star comes to life. The full description involves an intricate interplay between large-scale environmental factors and small-scale processes close to the star, connecting a number of physical mechanisms, including magnetic fields, self-gravity, radiative transfer, and time dependent chemistry.  The aim of the project is to construct a unified description of star formation, from large to small scales, using the world's most advanced numerical physics. A two-way approach will be used: the global approach (I) will deal with the dynamics of interstellar gas on the turbulent cloud scale, while the local approach (II) will concentrate on the formation of the protostellar seed.  The objectives are:  -  Ia. Carry out a parameter study of the effects of cloud mass, turbulence, radiative transfer, and magnetization on stellar populations in giant molecular clouds -  Ib. Create a realistic model for protostellar radiative and outflow feedback and examine its effects on the star formation efficiency -  Ic. Quantify the effects of supernova-triggered star formation - IIa. Simulate the formation of single protostars using extremely detailed physics (non-ideal MHD, multi-frequency radiative transfer) - IIb. Incorporate for the first time into the simulations a chemistry module which interacts with the gas and radiation field - IIc. Study episodic accretion events in protostars to try and explain under-luminous young stellar objects.  This is an ambitious, strongly multidisciplinary program, which fits perfecty in the research activities of the host institute. To ensure the project's success, I have a proven record of working with the different numerical techniques required, as well as an excellent understanding of astronomical observations.",0,0
81,90258,Yes,"The Limits of Peaceful Co-existence: Jewish-Arab Relations, Urban Space and State Violence in Palestinian-Israeli Mixed Towns, 1882 to the Present","As part of a larger project on ethnic relations in Mediterranean Cities, this research examines how urban space, violent conflict and national identities have been both represented and produced in ethnically mixed cities in Israel/Palestine. Against the background of a century-long conflict between the Jewish and Palestinian national movements, this project studies the relations between opposing “projects of nativization” and community building efforts in a contested urban setting. While most scholars conceptualize these collective identities as separate projects – defined only by the exclusion and negation of the other – I focus instead on the relations of mutual determination between local communities often rendered invisible in Palestinian-Israeli studies. Thus, the study posits mixed towns as a challenge to the ethno-nationalist guiding principles of the Israeli state, which ultimately fails to maintain segregated and ethnically stable spaces. This failure results in the parallel existence of heteronomous spaces in these cities – operating through multiple, often contradictory logics of space, class, nation and governance. Analyzed relationally, these spaces produce a peculiar form of quotidian social relations between Arabs and Jews as well as new forms of local identities that challenge both Palestinian and Jewish nationalisms. Focusing on cities like Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Lydda and Ramla, I historicize the problematic place they occupy in the Israeli and Palestinian popular, political and sociological imagination. Through ethnographic, statistical and historical analysis I show how Jewish and Palestinian citizens, implicated in relations of interdependence, strive to define their respective collective identity. These processes serve as a lens through which the research engages a wider set of questions in political sociology and urban anthropology regarding ethnicity, citizenship, and identity-making as embedded in practices of  “making place.”",1,1
582,195252,No,The evolutionary and ecological implications of mito-nuclear epistasis,"The main hypothesis of the proposed research is that, contrary to common and long-standing belief, mitochondrial genetic variation is functional and plays a key role in evolutionary adaptation. I suggest that a novel understanding of selection on mtDNA can derive from simultaneously considering sex-specific selection and genetic interactions between mtDNA and nDNA. Because males are a genetic “dead-end” for mtDNA, mtDNA mutations that are detrimental for males but beneficial for females will spread. This will generate a male-specific genetic load (“the mother’s curse”). Further, the main energy producing pathway in eukaryotes (the OXPHOS pathway) is built collectively by products of the mitochondrial and the nuclear genome. Thus, mtDNA and nDNA are potentially entangled in an intricate web of epistatic interactions that dictates organismal metabolism. The proposed research is built upon a series of interrelated parts, and will use a very amenable insect model organism and employ a range of different research methodologies. Specific aims of the proposed research is (1) to assess the effects of mito-nuclear genotype on key life history traits such as metabolic rate and test whether these effects are sex-specific in line with the “mother’s curse” and (2) to test the hypothesis that mito-nuclear interactions promotes the maintenance of polymorphism in mitochondrial genome through negative frequency dependent selection. This research will have a range of biological implications, ranging from applied medical genetics over our use of mitochondrial genetic markers in population genetics/biology to speciation and our understanding of thermal adaptation to climate change.",0,0
295,104223,No,Integrating Post-Abortion Family Planning Services into  China's existing abortion service in hospital settings,"In 2008 an estimated 13 million induced abortions were conducted in China. Induced abortions are associated with a high risk of injury or long-term physical and psychological morbidity and a heavy social and economic burden. Most abortions occur in cities and the epidemic affects young and unmarried women as well as rural-to-urban migrant women.  The large number of abortions is primarily due to contraceptive failure or no use of contraception. The Chinese Family Planning (FP) program focuses mainly on birth control among married couples and the services are provided by an independent FP system. Young and unmarried women including rural-to-urban migrant women are less likely to access professional FP services. Abortion is a commonly used way to end unwanted pregnancy, however, post-abortion family planning services are often lacking in hospital settings.  The INPAC project consortium proposes to integrate post-abortion family planning services into existing abortion services in hospital settings in China and to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions in terms of reduction of unwanted pregnancies and repeat abortions. Based on the project findings, policy recommendations on health system organization aiming to improve equitable access to reproductive healthcare and FP service will be developed.  Context-specific interventions will be developed based on a situation analysis of the effects  of the current FP policy and a feasibility assessment of the integration approach. The proposed interventions will be implemented in 30 divisions of mainland China and evaluated with regard to its effectiveness. The project will contribute to standardize the post-abortion family planning services and decrease the long-term costs related to abortion in China. The results of this research will also be of interest to other countries with high abortion rates.",0,0
115,222416,Yes,"Imperial Queers, Republican Subjects: The Politics of Queer Historiography in Turkey","Historiography has played a crucial role in nation-building projects across the world and Turkey presents a striking example of this phenomenon. In the country’s formative years (1923-1938), while the government took measures to create an official formulation of Ottoman and Turkish history, dissident groups across the political spectrum produced its alternatives. In both hegemonic and alternative historiography projects, gender and sexuality were of key significance. This research analyzes the politics of queer historiography and archival practice in this period by focusing on the works of three intellectuals: Hüseyin Rahmi Gürpınar (1864-1944), Reşad Ekrem Koçu (1905-1975), and Rıza Nur (1879-1942). The project examines how these prominent queer figures, who were born in the Ottoman Empire and witnessed the emergence of the nation-state, produced alternative and queer formulations of the past in the service of Marxist, neo-Imperialist, and fascist ideologies as they negotiated the politics of citizenship and belonging. To understand these processes, the project uses multi-sited archival research, and presents critical biographies of the authors together with close readings of the texts and performances they created. As the first comprehensive study on queer historiography and archival practice in Turkey, this research brings a new perspective to the sexual dimensions of nation-building. With the aid of ethnography, the project also analyzes the current efforts to redefine the official formulation of Turkey’s history, and how the works of queer intellectuals continue to influence both mainstream and alternative historiographical projects in the country. The project thus challenges some of the popular trends in Ottoman and Turkish historiography, especially the gendered and sexualized aspects of oral history projects as well as their ramifications on the current historical justice efforts—including the Armenian Genocide.",1,1
172,226002,Yes,India's Politics in Its Vernaculars,"It is extraordinary that, given the significance of India as the world’s largest democracy and a Rising Power, we know so little about the conceptual foundations of its political life. Much has been written about political ideas and institutions imported from Europe. And yet no focused, consecutive effort has gone into understanding the ideas that guide most ordinary Indian citizens’ engagement in their political lives. Analyses conducted through Euro-American categories and theoretical frames elevated to the status of universals – rights, identity, public sphere, secularism or indeed ‘politics’ – only generate paradoxes. This project will be a pioneering exploration of India’s demotic political ideas, which it will examine through a close ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of its political life. Bringing together a team of anthropologists, historians, linguists and scholars of politics, and taking inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, it will (1) lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life; (2) develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and (3) explore with scholars of European political ideas the implications of this work for global political theory. Drawing on the PI’s established work on the demotic categories and values in Indian politics, the project will break major new ground in the study of subcontinental politics; extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project beyond Europe; and make analytical advances towards a truly global political theory, grounded not in the analytical lingua franca of Western political theory, but in the realities of political life around the globe.",1,1

The NextMuSE paradigm is defined by two characteristics: - accurate robust multi-mechanics modelling in applications where traditional methods fail (e.g. simultaneous fluid and solid mechanics in a ship under extreme wave loading). - an immersive, interactive user interface (ICARUS) to allow the user-engineer to manage and partially automate the extremely complex inputs and outputs of such multi-mechanics simulations.<br/>The objectives will be achieved through 7 work packages.1: Key enhancements of core SPH algorithms.2: Adapted physical modelling of fluids: turbulence, multiphase flow.3: Modelling of fluid-structure interaction.4: High-performance computing: highly efficient scalable algorithms for very large simulations.5: Development of an immersive and highly visual simulation/design environment to interact with the technology.6: Realistic representative applications in the marine, energy and biomedical industries.7: Dissemination, communication and exploitation.<br/>This project will remove technology roadblocks and enable an enhanced and extended role for ICT and HPC in socio-economically important engineering RTD and innovation sectors (including energy, healthcare and transport). Although there are  challenging scientific bottlenecks, risk is managed and minimised through the design of the work plan and the selection of the consortium. The risk is balanced by the potential reward for this project, which is a proof-of-concept for a paradigm shift which will open the way for advanced immersive HPC simulation tools, seamlessy integrated into the RTD process for the most challenging engineering problems.",0,0
219,78650,No,Social Knoledge for e-Governance,"Reputation is a social knowledge on which a number of social decisions are accomplished. Regulating society from the morning of mankind (Dunbar, 1998), it becomes more crucial with the pace of development of ICT technologies, dramatically enlarging the range of interaction and generating new types of aggregation. Despite its critical role, reputation generation, transmission and use are unclear.  The project aims to an interdisciplinary theory of reputation and to modelling the interplay between direct evaluations and meta-evaluations in three types of decisions, epistemic (whether to form a given evaluation), strategic (whether and how interact with target), and memetic (whether and which evaluation to transmit). Finally, current technological developments of reputation are dusting off traditional remedies like word of mouth and chatty talk. The theory in question will be shown to help design reputation technology. The proposed project will benefit from a synergy between experts in an innovative methodology, i.e. agent-based social simulation, and in computational modelling and software development, all good representatives of the European community in these fields of science.  The work plan includes: (1) theory-building, delivering a survey of online reputation systems, social cognitive and computational models of reputation decisions, and a provisional White Book for Reputation Technology; (2) tool development, delivering a virtual experimental laboratory for human and a multi agent platform for artificial experiments; (3) theory-testing, delivering cross-methodological data about impact of infrastructures on reputation decisions; (4) system design delivering a final White Book on Reputation Technology, and a DemoSystem, based on Grid platform, for demonstrating instructions it will contains; (5) detailed activity of dissemination and management.",1,0
677,80701,No,Enabler for next generation service delivery,"The MULTINET communication system will be capable of providing the network and application functionalities so that multiple simultaneous networks can be seamlessly handled to optimise communications in multiple dimensions; while sustaining the existing mobile industry and attracting new business revenue. The capabilities provided facilitate mobile broadband multimedia communication services of high quality and functionality with an optimum cost, tailored to the communication offer provided.  The project aims at providing the necessary networks and application functionality enhancements for seamless data communication mobility in an scenario where the user can benefit without intervention from simultaneous transparent network connectivity among the available access networks to benefit from ubiquitous access to broadband applications. The goal consists in the development and validation of an evolved communication system that provides mobility to users in the context of mobile and wireless networks (IP based networks), without modifying neither the existing network, nor the user applications, and in a transparent way.  To achieve this strategic objective, a harmonized technological RTD approach is implemented by providing: - Tools and protocol for seamless broadband multimedia session delivery across heterogeneous networks. - Middleware techniques for application layer service to adapt to underlying bearer characteristics. - Mechanism for bearer services to adapt to the changing nature of multimedia applications.  Two scenarios identified are capable of capturing broadband communication needs at work while on the move.

208,35793,No,Improving software products quality through the use of metrics,"Quality requirements of industrial software are very high and the correctness of the source code is of great importance for this purpose. Traditionally, the correctness of a program has been checked through an exhaustive set of test cases that usually consider the program as a black box. It is well known that it is impossible to check the whole behaviour of the program through exhaustive tests, so an static analysis of the source code at an early stage can be of great help in order to pay special attention to those parts of the source code that are specially complex or not well written. The objective of QUALIMET is to improve this software development process, introducing a set of style norms to be used when coding in C\\, and a set of metrics to be used on the source code in order to check its quality.  THE EXPERIMENT The QUALIMET experiment will consist on the introduction of a methodology for analysing the correctness of the source code. This experiment will be carried out in the context of the development of a small distributed control system based on a PC network for process monitoring and control. The development in C\\ of this small tool, following an object oriented methodology, will be the baseline project. The different aspects of the methodology that will be covered under the experiment are the following:  Definition of a set of style norms to be used when coding in C\\. Selection of software quality measurement tools suitable for their use in C\\ source code. Selection of a set of metrics to be applied on the C\\ source code. Usage of the selected style norms and metrics for C\\ in the baseline project's source code.  The conclusions obtained through the experiment will allow to refine its results in order to be used in future applications.  ROBOTIKER employs 99 people, 68% of them are involved in software development.  EXPECTED IMPACT AND EXPERIENCE After the end of QUALIMET, ROBOTIKER will incorporate these quality assurance techniques into its current methodology for developing software, in order to have a complete methodology that guarantees software products quality, minimising the complexity of the code earlier in the programming process, yielding more maintainable and less error-prone software and improving the quality of the software and the satisfaction of its customers.",0,0
88,195260,Yes,Transnational nationalism. Far-Right Nationalist Groups in East Central Europe in the 20th and 21st centuries,"The project will study networks of youth far-right nationalist organizations in East Central Europe, paying particular attention to the developments in Austria, Croatia, Hungary, and Poland. Using historical and anthropological methods, the study explores the transnational dimension of nationalist organizations: the networking of ideologies and tactics. It entails a combination of archival research, interviews, and participant observation during nationalist gatherings. In proposing a historical-ethnographic study of youth far-right nationalist groups, the project aims to fill the gap in existing scholarship, resulting from the lack of interdisciplinary dialogue, negligence of a historical dimension, and macro-perspective predominance. Inspired by the transnational history approach, it foregrounds the complex – synchronic and diachronic - interactions between European nationalisms and studies agents of those exchanges, examining nationalist activists’ motivations and experiences. A combination of anthropological in-depth analysis and historical approach offers an original perspective by drawing parallels between nationalist activities against a multinational federative system, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the EU. It provides a critical tool for challenging unidirectional models of modernity and nationalism and for reflecting on the challenges to the European integration. The project will be undertaken at the Institute for East European History, University of Vienna, under the supervision of Prof. Philipp Ther, a leading specialist in the field of transnational history. During the secondment at the Department of Gender Studies, Central European University in Budapest, I will explore the gender dimension of nationalist activism. The fellowship will constitute a fundamental step in my academic career, enabling me to develop a new field of research and expertise and to gain skills necessary to become an independent researcher and to lead my own research group.",1,1
474,200461,No,Exotic quantum phases with dipolar Fermi gases of spin-polarized Erbium atoms in reduced dimensions,"Ultracold quantum gases have triggered great interest for their possibilities of simulating quantum matter. Thanks to the high tunability of these systems, direct signatures of fundamental phenomena in solid-state physics have in particular become accessible. However the variety of physical effects have long been restricted to the case of particles interacting via  short-range and isotropic forces. Recent progress in cooling and trapping highly magnetic atoms have enriched the field by making available dipolar quantum matter, in which the interaction (DDI) is intrinsically long-range and anisotropic. This new feature brings tremendous possibilities for quantum simulation, and hence fruitful insights in long-awaited explanations for phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity. This project targets to demonstrate collective dipolar phenomena and exotic phases in ultracold gases made of identical (i.e. spin-polarized) strongly magnetic fermions in two and zero dimensions. Identical dipolar fermions are of special interest thanks to the absence of short-range interaction in the ultracold regime, resulting in purely dipolar systems. They have however been very little studied up to now. This project aims to fill this gap and unveils the interplay between dipolar interactions and reduced dimensions, combining perfectly the expertise of the applicant with the one of the supervisor and her team. Her group has developed the first experimental apparatus producing quantum gases of Erbium, which is among the most magnetic atoms of the periodic table.  In this project, we will explore the impact of dipolar interaction on strongly correlated phases. We will investigate asymmetric Cooper pairing due to the anisotropic nature of DDI in the privileging 2D geometry, and study the resulting superfluid phase. We will study spontaneous pattern formation from the long-range character of DDI both in 2D and in a lattice and the emergence of the long awaited stripe phases.",0,0
245,97883,No,A pan-European infrastructure for quality in nanomaterials safety testing,"Nanoscale objects interact with living organisms in a fundamentally new manner, ensuring that a fruitful marriage of nanotechnology and biology will long outlast short term imperatives. Therefore, investment in an infrastructure to drive scientific knowledge of the highest quality will have both immediate benefits of supporting the safety assessment of legacy nanomaterials, as well as pointing towards future (safe) applications with the lasting benefits to society. There are immediate priorities, for few doubt that serious damage to confidence in nanotechnology, unless averted, could result in missed opportunities to benefit society for a generation, or more. QNano will materially affect the outcome, at this pivotal moment of nanotechnology implementation. The overall vision of QNano is the creation of a ‘neutral’ scientific & technical space in which all stakeholder groups can engage, develop, and share scientific best practice in the field. Initially it will harness resources from across Europe and develop efficient, transparent and effective processes. Thereby it will enable provision of services to its Users, and the broader community, all in the context of a best-practice ethos. This will encourage evidence-based dialogue to prosper between all stakeholders. However, QNano will also pro-actively seek to drive, develop and promote the highest quality research and practices via its JRA, NA and TA functions, with a global perspective and mode of implementation. QNano will also look to the future, beyond the current issues, and promote the growth and development of the science of nanoscale interactions with living organisms. By working with new and emerging scientific research communities from medicine, biology, energy, materials and others, it will seek to forge new directions leading to new (safe, responsible, economically viable) technologies for the benefit of European society.",0,0
560,61546,No,"Development and validation of Source, Optics And Resist In Next Generation EUV lithography","The objective of the current proposal is to carry out the research and development work necessary to provide a set of scaleable components for Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) and to validate their performances in producing sub-70 nm features on silicon using industrial compatible wafer processing technology. These components include a novel high repetition rate high intensity micro discharge pulse plasma EUV source, a set of matching multi-layer collection and projection mirror optics using an active mirror design and an optimised single layer EUV resist. The goal of the project includes optimisation necessary to provide the EU semiconductor industry with these components for future integration. The work will be carried out in a 36 months programme, by a trans-national team of 5 partners involving national research organizations and industrial SMEs in 3 countries, covering all the key areas of expertise required.  Objectives: The road map of the world semiconductor industry demands the availability of a next generation lithography system by 2005 for commercial production of microelectronics with feature size below 70nm. Currently EUVL is one of the most favoured options. While engineering test stand on EUVL has been established to evaluate the technology, a number of key issues remain to be resolved for industrial application. The objective of the current proposal is to carry out the R&D work necessary to provide a set of scalable components for EUVL and to validate their performances in producing sub-70nm features on silicon using industrial compatible wafer processing technology. These components include a novel high rep rate high intensity discharge plasma EUV source, a set of matching multi-layer collection and projection mirror optics and optimised EUV resists. The goal is to develop the core competence to provide the EU semi conductor industry with these tools for future integration.  Work description: The area most lagging in the development of commercial EUVL technology is the radiation source. EUV is currently produced using a high power laser at low total efficiency. The work here provides a cost effective alternative based on a high rep rate high efficiency micro plasma pulse discharge. The solution evolves from a EU TMR research project on intense pulsed capillary discharge plasma radiation sources. Work here will focus on radiation physics of dense plasmas and atomic physics. Full 2D numerical simulations of the high current discharge including equation of states and full radiation transport, in order to optimise the operating conditions for maximum radiation efficiency, will back the theoretical and experimental work. A novel high efficiency all solid state pulsed power driver will be developed to drive the discharge, providing a current pulse of <10ns at a rate of rise of >10^12 A/s. Specific work on electrode design will aim to allow operation life of 10^10 pulses at a rep rate of 5kHz.  EUV will be collected by a set of multi-layer reflection optics, the work of which forms the second part of the project. A novel multiple active mirror scheme will be developed to provide a cost effective solution for large numerical aperture. The multi-layer design aims to maximize the total radiation collected and projected onto the resist, matching the source closely. Debris mitigation solutions will be developed to protect the optics. The third area of work is the development of a high sensitivity single layer resist optimised for the EUV region, benefiting from the work on a current EU project on resist for Deep UV lithography. The R&D work on these 3 elements will be validated in a scaled EUVL test-rig to demonstrate the fabrication of < 70nm features.  Milestones: Milestones set to chart the progress include: the completion of the Micro Plasma Pulse radiation source, the 5kHz High Repetition Rate High Current driver, the EUV Test System Specification, the Resist Specification for EUV Lithography, and the Demonstration of < 70nm features and the Final Report. They reflect the expected result during the project, each being a step forward towards the final achievement, on the development of leadership skill in components for a EUVL system in future.",0,0
