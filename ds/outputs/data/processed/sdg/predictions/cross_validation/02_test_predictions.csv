213,217992,No,New challenges for Urban Engineering Seismology,"Recent devastating earthquakes and induced seismicity near infrastructures must become the centrepiece of analysis in reducing risk and increasing resilience, facing up to global urban population growth in the coming decades and the concentration of wealth in cities. The prediction of seismic ground motion and response of structures are key issues in reduction of seismic urban risk. There is therefore a demand for highly trained scientists with a broad understanding of engineering seismology and earthquake engineering, skills being essential in academic research, in private companies with activities related to risk mitigation and energy facilities and for policy makers. The URBASIS project aims to provide a multi-disciplinary training platform for ESR in order to develop their individual project and to promote their entrepreneurship and their employability toward the academic, private and insurance or decision-making sector. High-quality supervision of the ESR will be ensured through the international recognition of the URBASIS partners. A comprehensive set of transferable skills will be developed through innovative and interdisciplinary joint research projects between academic and non-academic partners on the prediction of seismic hazard in urban areas considering low probability/high consequences events and induced seismicity related to the exploitation of energy resources; the seismic ground motion prediction within the non-free-field urban area; the coupling between ground motion and structures/infrastructures responses for natural and induced seismicity including time dependency vulnerability; and the systemic risk of interconnected urban systems. URBASIS will create a lasting collaboration for the establishment of a European network of academic and non-academic experts, improving the interface with decision-makers. Advanced capacities in modelling and predicting seismic impact in cities will be got, putting the urban environment as the centrepiece of URBASIS.",0,0
708,99116,No,Advanced materials enabling HIgh-VOlume road transport applications of lightweight structural COMPosite parts,"The rapidly growing use of high-performance composites in high-end sectors such as aerospace, show that these materials are already commercially viable as long as production volumes are limited and applications not primarily cost-driven. In order to achieve a step-change in the application of high-performance composites in larger-volume applications, HIVOCOMP focuses on achieving radical advances in two materials systems that show unique promise for cost effective, higher-volume production of high performance carbon fibre reinforced parts. These are: 1) advanced polyurethane (PU) thermoset matrix materials offering increased mechanical performance and reduced cycle times compared to epoxy, and 2) thermoplastic PP- and PA6-based self-reinforced polymer composites incorporating continuous carbon fibre reinforcements with lower process times and far higher toughness than current thermoplastic and thermoset solutions. The project will analyse and develop these matrix materials, their combination with advanced textile preforms, and optimise material properties for advanced processing technologies, joining technologies (adhesives / welding) and the incorporation and self-diagnosis (sensing) materials. The focus on breakthrough material innovations are complemented by enabling work covering material testing, chemical and micro-mechanical modelling and simulation tool development, as well as LCA, cost and recycling analysis, and prototyping of typical applications, assuring that the proposed material innovations can be successfully translated into high-impact industrial applications. The project drives the material innovations with the road vehicle sector in mind, but has clearly identified spin-off applications in other sectors. The project foresees a step-wise implementation in future products introduced into larger-volume transport applications starting with validated demonstration parts in 2013, and so ensuring a large-scale societal impact of the innovations achieved.",0,0
447,209248,No,Development of a high-resolution method to monitor structural changes of regulatory RNAs and therapeutic oligo-nucleotides directly in-cell.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators in cells with a complexity yet to be unraveled. By targeting one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs) they affect a vast number of biological processes and are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancer. This makes them potential candidates for cancer-diagnostics and -therapeutics. This opportunity can only be fully exploited by a better comprehension of how and when each mRNA is targeted by a miRNA, a fact, which is currently still poorly understood. Besides regulatory RNAs, synthetic “anti-sense” oligonucleotides (AONs) are currently tested as cancer drugs. Progress in this field has been slow due to unspecific off-target-effects i.e. the lack of understanding, of the mechanism of AONs targeting mRNAs. This project focuses on overcoming this lack of knowledge of the targeting process. To understand the intermolecular interactions occurring in the cell we will, for the first time, monitor the molecular structure and structural changes (dynamics) of nucleotides (miRNAs as well as AONs) in the living cell, and link these in-cell structures to the molecule’s targeting function. Combining existing knowledge of the host in structural and molecular biology of miRNAs with the experience in methods development in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of the experienced researcher (ER), we will develop a set of robust and reliable in-cell NMR methods to determine cellular concentration, structure and dynamics within the cell at high resolution. The scope of the method will be demonstrated on: (i) a miRNA, miR-34a, which targets more than 50 different mRNAs, related to cancer and other cellular processes, as well as (ii) an AON drug candidate in collaboration with AstraZeneca. This project will benefit drug development against various diseases and will enable the ER to contribute to solving today's health problems and develop further towards becoming a future group leader on the interface of research in academia and industry.",0,0
350,64499,No,Removal of spinal column from cattle and sheep carcasses.,"Regulations are required in all EU states to ensure that spinal card material and spinal column in some states is removed from cattle and sheep carcasses. Carcasses are contaminated with CNS material during conventional splitting operations, and washing does not remove the contamination. A novel saw, for complete removal of the vertebral column from inside the eviscerated carcass before splitting, has been developed under laboratory conditions; this ensures that all cord material remains encased in bone. Prototype saws for cattle and sheep carcasses will be used to validate the above laboratory results under commercial slaughterhouse conditions. Functional tests , will evaluate the commercial viability of this new approach and thru results will be used in an economic appraisal. The main objective of this project is to ensure that the results are disseminated to an extended audience across the EU.",0,0
1139,43669,No,Environmental estrogens (EEs) and the neuro-endocrine regulation of reproduction in fish?,"Environmental estrogens (EEs) are a heterogenous group of chemicals containing natural and synthetic estrogens and xenoestrogens. EEs are pollutants of the freshwater environment and exert the biological activity of estrogenic hormones. Concern has been expressed over the possibility that EEs disrupt the endocrine regulation of reproduction in wildlife and/or humans, and the information available at present suggests that it is very plausible that EEs have such effects. However, the evidence that EEs constitute a real problem is meagre. Only when serious effects of EEs are recorded will it then be necessary to unravel the molecular mechanisms that govern these effects, and to develop strategies to manage EE-related risks. Therefore, the present proposal aims to evaluate EFFECTS of four relevant and representative EEs on the neuro-endocrine regulation of reproduction in freshwater fish. Reproduction in all vertebrates from fish to mammals is regulated by a neuro-endocrine system, the brain-pituitary-gonad (BGP) axis. Estrogens play a pivotal role in this regulatory system in both males and females. Previous work demonstrated that EEs induced, in male fish, the otherwise female-specific production of yolk proteins or inhibited testicular growth. However, also the brain-pituitary part of the BPG axis may be affected by EEs. After all, endogenous estrogens regulate the (i) amount of brain neurohormones involved in reproduction (e.g. gonadotropin releasing hormone - GnRH); (ii) expression and/or release of GnRH receptors and of gonadotropic hormone (GTH) by pituitary gonadotropin cells; (iii) testicular sex hormone synthesis. Effects of EEs on the core-components of the BPG axis are suspected to have a significant impact on reproduction because of possible consequences for sexual maturation and reproductive behaviour. We propose to investigate in male of three freshwater fishes the effects of exposure to EEs via the water on (i) GnRH amounts in brain and pituitary, (ii) pituitary GnRH receptors and GTH synthesis and release, and (iii) pituitary GnRH and testicular GTH responsiveness, thus covering core-components of the BPG axis. Finally, an immortalized fish gonadotropin cell line will be developed to provide an alternative to the use of experimental animals. Such a cell line is expected to serve well in future studies to test the endocrine-disrupting risks of EEs (and other pollutants) in a physiologically more meaningful context than is possible now with non-gonadotroph cell lines. The study can be carried out in a relatively short period (two years) as all expertise needed is available in the participating research groups.

63,48182,Yes,Development of amelioration strategies to reduce environmental deterioration and agricultural production losses in water repellent regions,"Project objective The overall aim of this proposal is to derive guidelines for agricultural use of water repellent regions around the world. These guidelines aim to protect the environment by reducing surface and ground water contamination and soil erosion, and help to increase production efficiency in a sustainable way. Motive Soil water repellency, which generally is caused by the presence of hydrophobic organic substances in the soil, often leads to  i) severe runoff and erosion,  ii) rapid leaching of surface-applied agrichemicals,  iii) significant loss of water and nutrient availability for crops, and  iv) low crop and pasture production.    Therefore, a strong need exists for a multidisciplinary transnational research effort to derive guidelines for sustainable use of water repellent regions aiming at minimizing environmental degradation and crop production losses. Work content Within the proposed project, a total of six work packages are distinguished comprising field data collection activities, laboratory experiments, model development and application, and testing and evaluation of various amelioration techniques. The first work package focuses on identifying water repellent soils in the field, and on deriving, and establishing international standards for measurement techniques and assessing the respective degrees of soil water repellency. The second work package aims to unravel which substances are responsible for inducing soil water repellency, and to link them to different vegetation types and management histories. The third work package aims to investigate, under controlled laboratory conditions, the water flow and transport mechanisms in undisturbed soils with differing degrees of water repellency and in soils subject to differing amelioration techniques. The fourth work package deals with extending or modifying existing water flow and transport simulation models to make them applicable to water repellent soils. In the fifth work package, field trials are planned to test various amelioration techniques in practice, and to create databases to be used for model application. The sixth work package comprises an evaluation phase, in which the various amelioration techniques will be rated according to their effectiveness in reducing runoff, erosion, and leaching of contaminants, and in increasing crop and pasture performance and production. Finally, the guidelines will be defined for optimal use and management of agricultural water repellent soils. Innovation of proposed project Although soil water repellency has been studied by many researchers from different disciplines, little is known about goodfarming' practices in water repellent areas around the world. The research activities carried out within this project are highly innovative, as they combine fundamental and practical oriented research in order to arrive at  i) a better understanding of the occurrence, causes, and processes involved in water repellent soils, and ii) guidelines for sustainable agricultural use and management to reduce runoff and erosion, leaching, and increase crop efficiency. Project deliverables The 'Contract Deliverables' consist of  i) yearly progress reports,  ii) a project summary providing insight into all aspects addressed within the individual work packages, and iii) guidelines and practical farm-notes about optimal management of agricultural water repellent soils focusing on minimizing environmental degradation and agricultural production losses. The 'Technical Deliverables' comprise  i) databases,  ii) a computer model able to simulate water flow and transport through agricultural water repellent soils at different climatic conditions, and  iii) publications in national and international technical and scientific journals.",1,1
940,98016,No,Genetics of Systemic lupus erythematosus in northern and southern European populations,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease mediated by autoantibodies, which recognize nuclear and tissue specific antigens.The aetiology of this disease is incompletely determined.  However, the risk to SLE has a significant genetic component, a conclusion supported by successful genome wide association studies (GWAS) in SLE published since 2008 - all were conducted in US-based cohorts. The variability within the “top hits” generated by each GWAS indicates the lack of power of these studies. In order to confidently define the full genetic architecture of SLE a significantly larger study will be required.  My host laboratory is leading the effort in a well-powered GWA experiment in 5,500 SLE cases, collected from Northern and  Southern Europe. First, high density SNP genotyping will be performed using Illumina Omni-Quad chip.  I will participate in the ensuing genetic associations analyses on the data generated.  Thereafter, I will make a meta-analysis of these GWAS data with the published GWAS in SLE in northern European populations and then to compare these data with the data of the southern European GWAS. We will seek replication for novel associations in additional samples available through the SLEGEN consortium. Finally I will select one novel locus in which to conduct functional studies that will help to clarify the role of the locus in SLE ethiopathogenesis.",0,0
1011,200868,No,Identity Management on Social Media by Diasporic LGBTQs,"The internet, and social media in particular, create new opportunities and pose new challenges for the ways people think about themselves as well as manage the expressions of their identities. In this research project I aim to enrich our knowledge about the transformations of identity in the new media landscape of the early XXI century by investigating those transformations from the perspective of diasporic LGBTQs, that is, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. I will focus on the latest theories on social media and identity  about 1) fixating the fragmented self (van Zoonen 2013), 2) collapsed contexts (boyd 2011) and 3) the multiplication of contexts (Papacharissi 2011), by investigating those phenomena from the perspective of Polish post-accession immigrants to the UK. I will examine what diasporic LGBTQs and their social media’s uses can teach us about the relationship between the internet and identity, as well as what opportunities and difficulties social media create to a group that faces different challenges of exclusion and discrimination. I will first use a quantitative survey to map the diversity of social media used by Polish LGBTQs in the UK. However, because I am primarily interested in meanings of daily media practices, it is qualitative methods, and in-depth interviews in particular, which will form the core of my methodological toolkit. At the same time, to trigger more and better quality data I will combine traditional qualitative methods with such innovative approaches as think-aloud protocols (which require from participants to talk about the activity in which they are involved) and digital methods (the methods of the medium under scrutiny).",0,0
167,204471,Yes,INNOVATIVE EPIGENETIC MARKERS FOR FISH DOMESTICATION,"Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector in the world, since there is an increasing demand for fish protein to feed a growing global population, which cannot be met by fisheries. In order to ensure the sustainability of this sector it is critical to domesticate and selectively improve the major commercial fish species. To date, the genetic markers used in selective breeding of fish account only for a fraction of the observed phenotypic variation. EPIFISH is a scientifically innovative and timely project that will address fish domestication and selection from a new perspective using a multidisciplinary approach. The rapid pace of substantial phenotypic changes during adaptation to new environmental conditions in fish undergoing domestication raises the original hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process. Thus, the overarching aim of EPIFISH is to ascertain the importance of epigenetics in fish domestication using the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as model species. Specific objectives are i) to determine how selection affects the miRNA transcriptome and the epigenetic landscape during domestication, ii) to perform a functional characterization of miRNA variants and epigenetic alleles associated with growth, and iii) to validate them as potential epigenetic markers for future selective breeding programmes. The identification of epigenetic markers will be a ground-breaking element of EPIFISH with major impact on aquaculture biotechnology, since they will enable the development and application of epigenomic selection as a new feature in future selective breeding programmes. Moreover, the project outcomes will provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of epigenetics in fish domestication, which will surely open new horizons for future frontier research in epigenetics, namely transgenerational inheritance and nutritional epigenetics.",0,1
780,61724,No,Ceramic based coatings as solution for several surface unsolved problems on mould industry,"There is a great potential interest in the molding industry regarding production of moulds for low and mid series of plastic products. Actually, alloy steel moulds are used for the fabrication of low, mid and high series products. For mid and low series steel moulds are very expensive and they have excessive mechanical strength. Light alloys are now used with success in the production of prototypes for mould design optimization, that are adequate only for very short series, but they can be an interesting solution for low and mid series, if the surface resistance is improved. Ceramic hard coatings can be a solution for this problem. However, great difficulties related to the important mismatches between the mechanical and thermal properties of the Al alloys and the hard ceramic coatings lead to in service failure. In this project, this problem can be overcome by optimizing the system based in Ti-Al, with variable nitrogen contents, owing to the fact that Ti-Al (N) has high hardness and a much higher thermal expansion coefficient that traditional hard coatings which can significantly decrease the thermal stresses during the deposition.

522,6634,No,HIGH RESOLUTION 3-D SEISMIC REFLECTION APPLIED TO SUBSIDENCE EVALUATION AND SOLUTION MINE DESIGN,"The advantages of 3D shallow high resolution seismic reflection methods have been favorable compared against conventional 2D high resolution and 2D MiniSosie seismic data, as well as in the Hengelo solution mine as in the mine of Belvedere Spinello. Successful application in the first mine was followed by a test in Italy and this provided a basis of evaluation of site specific factors for the 3D-HRS method. Subsidence models have been developed after a detailed study of the geology and tectonic history was made of the area under investigation.  Concealed subsurface cavities were accurately delineated and controlled by sonar measurements as far as possible.  An acoustic simulation model was developed to study the behaviour of a brine filled cavity by seismic pick-up. The subsidence models were simulated and proved by numerical experiments using two different computer programs, as the finite difference program FLAC and the finite element program DIANA. The project objectives are to develop and assess the possibilities of a new technique that shall make possible evaluation of subsidence and improved mine planning of solution mines. Subsidence prediction improves safety and may reduce environmental problems of existing solution mines. The method must allow evaluation of the risk of subsidence in abandoned mine sites and in areas where sinkholes may occur. It is assessed whether the method under investigation is suitable for detection and delineation of underground voids. Certain underground mining and geotechnical applications benefit from the project.  The technical objectives focus on assessment of geotechnical parameters from 3D high resolution seismic data. Research on determination of geotechnical parameters for typical 3D HRS conditions is carried out. 3D HRS is compared with existing 2D conventional and 2D HRS data and to geological data obtained from boreholes. This comparison is performed in order to justify use of this more expensive yet promising technique. The seismic investigation should provide very accurate information on the structural geology and stratigraphy and the geotechnical parameters related to subsidence, since it is used for geotechnical investigations and modelling.  The tasks to be carried out include acquisition, processing and interpretation of 2D and 3D high resolution seismic data at two different test sites. For interpretation and evaluation purposes exploration boreholes are drilled to collect geological data, carry out wireline logging and acquire a velocity depth profile and synthetic seismogram. Sonar surveys in existing cavities are carried out to assess the capabilities for detecting concealed underground brine filled or earth filled voids.  The method is to be verified at two different test sites to determine the applicability in general and assess the importance of site specific factors in the method.",0,0

1045,32561,No,Chemical reactor modelling for fast exothermic and mixing sensitive reactions,"Objectives and content   Many of today's chemical products can only be made because of fundamental advances in the understanding of mixing processes. The new novel products and their manufacturing technology are to be developed based on fundamental know how of factors affecting in mixing sensitive reactions when the process is scaled up from laboratory to full scale production.   The objectives of this project comprises advanced chemical reactor modelling exploiting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and advanced flow patterns measuring technique development for model validation. CFD appears the ideal solution to this problem, but owing its origins outside the process industries it is not currently capable of realistic modelling of chemically complex systems. Additional modules are required for many common processes, of which fast chemical reactions probably have the highest immediate value to industry. These required modules will be developed in this project as well as the validation of the model using commercially important chemical reactors. The generated model will also be exploited in reactor development for two mixing sensitive commercially important reactions.   This project proposal include also a substantial interdisciplinary- scientific contribution connecting chemical and fluid flow phenomena. The numerical part of this project will rely heavily on previous successfully conducted EC RTD programmes in CDF-area.   The main deliverables of the proposed work are the provision of a validated chemical engineering tool, which represent a significant step forward beyond the existing state-of-the-art. Chemical industry will exploit the results in accelerated scale up research and the safe and optimal design of reactors.  The main industrial benefits will be the following :  - Less time consuming and lower cost design due to fewer experiments.  - Cost reduction due to the possibility of a priori determination of the reactor design.  - The achievement of higher yields and improved product quality due to improved process understanding and optimised operation conditions leading to higher selectivities and less waste.  - Environmentally safe reactors due to better control of unwanted side reactions.  - Operation control can be improved with better process control.",0,0

They reach out to the European research community in order to inform and raise awareness about the funding opportunities of the Framework Programme, to advise and assist potential applicants in the preparation, submission and follow-up of grant applications, and to offer support during the execution of projects – especially with respect to the management and administrative aspects of projects. Moreover, due to its closeness to the European research community, the European Commission perceives the NCP Network as an important instrument for gathering feedback on possible problems and difficulties in the implementation of the Framework Programme. One of the great strengths of the NCP system is its national orientation and ability to provide support to applicants in their own native language. This is carried out by experts that are not only well versed in the modalities of the Framework Programme, but, as a rule, also possess keen knowledge of the national research landscape in their respective fields. On the other hand, however, this national orientation poses certain problems. The decentralised system – organised and financed nationally – has led to the development of a collection of heterogeneous structures.  In an effort to address the weaknesses described above, the project proposal PeopleNetwork aims at the development and implementation of a coordination mechanism for stimulating closer cooperation among National Contact Points for the PEOPLE programme in the Seventh Framework Programme.

Percussive stone tools related to stone masonry techniques seen through experimentation and use-wear analysis.","The project proposes for the first time a global approach for the study of stone tools used in masonry in the Bronze Age Aegean. The study focusses on percussive tools used for cutting and dressing stone in Crete, the Cyclades and mainland Greece in the 2nd millennium B.C. This era saw the rise of the first monumental stone architecture in Europe, first in the palaces of Minoan Crete and from the 15th c. BC onwards, in the tombs and citadels of the Mycenaean mainland following trends known since the 3rd millennium BC in Egypt and the Near East . Scholars agree on the use of stone tools along with metal tools in stone masonry. However, in contrast with other contexts (Egypt, Hittite Anatolia), stone tools in question are absent from the archaeological record, and relatively little is known about tools and techniques. Considering that monumental masonry practices require important energy investment and skilled workforce reflecting a complex social organization , understanding related lithic technology is central to an appreciation of how these societies operated . Recent studies also demonstrate that masonry tools and techniques were part of large-scale technological transfers between the Aegean world and the Near East, especially Hittite Anatolia  and Egypt . This project will investigate to what degree, in which ways and contexts and why percussive stone tools were used following a multidisciplinary approach: 1) characterization of materials used for tools and masonry, 2) large-scale experimentations testing different types of stone and metal tools on different building materials, 3) multi-scale analysis of use wear traces on both tools and architectural components (archaeological and experimental), 4) comparative ethnoarchaeological study of material issued from key-sites in the Aegean and Anatolia.

These silver matrix oxide reinforced composites are used as the essential parts in the electrical contactors. The number of electrical contacts present throughout the world is estimated at 6500 Millions, which represent more than 500tons of silver matrix composites. 90% of the contactors use AgCdO elements.   In order to meet the project objective the partners intend to develop the reactive milling process, a variant of mechanical alloying. The preliminary work has shown that the use of the reactive milling leads to an essential improvement of the functional properties of the concerned material: The erosion rate of the material is divided by a factor 3 to 10 while exposed to electric arc. The importance of such an improvement can be understood when compared to the 20% or 30% percent improvement obtained applying other presently known methods.   The project implies:  - development of reactive milling technique  - development of high energy, non polluting attritor   The consortium comprises:  - CLAL, French leader in precious metal transformation and electrical contact manufacturing- project co-ordinator;  - SRM/CEA the reactive milling process inventor (FR);  - ZOZ Gmbh - German SME specialised in high energy mills manufacturing an its usual academic partner Siegen University (D);  - Inasmet Spanish research institute which will be in charge of development of coating for improved rnill;  - final user of electrical contacts, Swedish consortium ABB manufacturing electrical contactors;   The improvement of electrical properties of Ag-SnO2 is supposed to be the decisive factor in the replacement of toxic Ag-CdO which has been postulated and permanently delayed since 10 years.

To do so, it is necessary to promote the economic productivity and the level of integration by means of an integrated resource management system. Small ruminant production in this context refers to smallholder production systems located in the semi-humid regions of Southern Africa.  There is limited data on the integration of small-ruminant production in the cop-livestock farming systems.  This applies particularly in relation to socio-economic factors such as labour supply and productivity, resource allocation, economic productivity, institutions and services and the contribution of small ruminants to household incomes and food security (REAPER, 1992)   The proposal aims to study small ruminant production in Southern Africa by adopting a holistic systems approach; based on the realisation that small ruminants are a component of a farming system.  By considering the impact of factors internal and external to the production system, the proposal with help achieve a sustainable and environmentally sound system, with tangible benefits for the rural farming communities.  Through an integrated resources management approach, the project focuses on environmental protection and reduced degradation of community resources.

136,29382,Yes,ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABILITY BY AFFORESTATION OF AGRICULTURE SET-ASIDE AREAS : DEVELOPMENT OF ROOTS AND ROOT/SHOOTS-RATIOS,"Earlier afforestation of agricultural land with monocultures has in many areas been characterized by shortened rotations, extensive damage and nutrient losses, which heavily reduces the profitability. Because afforestaion of farm land, sustainable forest ecosystems and reduced losses of nutrients to aquatic ecosystems are central goals for future land use, tools for the establishment of sustainable forests must be developed. Among such tools should be 'rooting maps' and 'root/shoot ratio graphs' used by foresters and afforestation planners doing 'site mapping'.   The objectives of this proposal are:   1) a coordinated international 'mapping' of root architecture of several important tree species m Europe;   2) the development of root/shootratio graphs for the same species, and   3) to enhance knowledge about root physiology through experiments related to plant handling and site variation.   Comparable quantitative descriptions of these parameters shall be carried out for important tree species over a range of soil types and ageclasses. This has never been done before. Several information gaps have been identified by the formulation of a mechanistic, qualitative model for root development, and the proposal includes experiments to fill these gaps. Advanced theoretical concepts, methods and equipment have already been developed by the different participants, but the exchange of this expertise between participants is not realised.   A complete and disciplined cooperation on theory and methods is required to establish internationally comparable results, which are necessary to achieve the goals of the proposal. The results of the proposal will increase the quality of forest decisions in terms of breeding, choice of tree species and stand structure.

As the overall purpose of Clean Sky is to offer more eco-friendly solutions, the proposed alloy must also offer properties that allow some weight saving versus the incumbent alloys. This is achieved through mechanical properties, which determine the component thickness, and through density reduction.  The option proposed is to develop an AlMgLi alloy that inherently offers a 10% weight saving by density versus conventional alloys. Further improvements versus the currently flying aircraft can be achieved by design optimization. . Alcan has developed this type of alloy to a Technology Readiness Level 3. Following lab trials, two campaigns at industrial scale were already performed, that demonstrate the capabilities of this alloy type to fulfil the above requirements.  To bring the alloy to TRL6, the proposition is first to roll and heat treat an existing slab to determine the properties according to the precise requirements of the airframers issuing the call. Corrosion tests relevant to the application, with and without protection, fatigue before and after corrosion protection, and large flat panels damage tolerance tests will be performed.  A second step consists in casting, converting and characterizing a slightly modified composition, to be determined according to the results obtained in the first step. Minor elements could be tuned in order to obtain the optimum microstructure. In that second step, properties pertaining to the fabrication of components will be assessed in addition to the material properties as described above.  Capitalising on Alcan’s experience in airframe technology, the next step would be to support the build and testing of a demonstrator.  The project aims at starting in September 2011. This date has been fixed in agreement with the topic manager due to project planning and casting facility availability (scheduled month n°11).'",0,0
914,109264,No,ASTROCYTE REGULATION OF NEURONAL NETWORK ACTIVITY,"Healthy functionality in the brain relies on intricate neuron-glia networks. Recent data suggest that glial, including astrocytes, play a crucial role in the processing and storing on by the brain. In particular, synapses might not be bipartite, but rather tripartite structures, comprised of the pre- and the postsynaptic terminals and the surrounding astrocyte. Moreover, astrocytes, like neurons, form intricate interconnected networks that afford long-range communication via the propagation of calcium waves. Therefore, neurons and astrocytes form intertwined neuron-glial networks supporting active partnership between the two cell populations. Hence, understanding the nature of neuron-glia interactions is essential to understand how the brain functions, and will serve as a stepping stone for deciphering brain disorders.  Our long-term goal is to reveal the mechanisms that control and regulates the activity of combined neuron-glia networks. The specific objectives of this application, which are fundamental in the pursuit of that goal, are (1) to determine the properties of astrocytic modulation of synaptic transmission; and (2) to characterize how such modulation shapes neuronal activity in neuron-glia networks of the brain.  To pursue these aims we will employ a comprehensive theoretical investigation to develop mathematical and biophysical models in support to experiments, at the many levels and scales of action of neuron-astrocyte signaling.  The significance of understanding glia-neuron interactions is several-fold as it pertains to a very wide range of applications, from basic understanding of neuronal activity, to developing therapeutic strategies toward the treatment of neurological disorders. Here, we will focus on how modulations of synaptic transmission by astrocytes could favor the emergence of synchronized neuronal, leveraging the predictions of our theoretical approach in the perspective of brain disorders, and epilepsy in particular.",0,0
129,90766,Yes,V is for Vegetable: Applying Learning theory to increase liking and intake of vegetables,"It is now well-established that consuming fruits and vegetables promotes health and well-being.  In particular, intake of fruits and vegetables protects against cancer and is associated with lower levels of obesity.  Consumption of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is predicted by the extent to which these foods are liked.  However, vegetable intakes remain relatively low, especially in children.  Establishing preference for vegetables early in a child’s development provides the best opportunity to enhance intake and to promote preferences which will last throughout life.  Most children in Europe fail to consume recommended 5 per day portions of fruits and vegetables and many fail to meet minimum recommendations to eat just one portion of vegetables each day. Therefore, this proposal has three main aims: to compare different methods of introducing complimentary foods in member states which best predict liking of vegetables in the first year of life; to develop and test an optimal weaning strategy to promote vegetable acceptance in infants; and to increase liking and intake of vegetables in children aged 4-5 years using flavour-flavour and flavour-consequence learning.  The main outcomes of this research programme are the development of a weaning strategy with an emphasis on early and sustained exposure to vegetable flavours; identification and development of new products to facilitate liking for vegetables and preparing an evidence-base for enhancing intake of vegetables in school age children.",1,1
580,106098,No,A forward genetic screen in the marine planktonic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata,"Diatoms carry out 1/5 of the photosynthesis on Earth and are essential to aquatic ecosystems. In addition to their fundamental role in carbon fixation, they play a key role in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrate and silica, have other complex metabolic abilities (urea cycle, fatty acid metabolism) and developed several strategies for the adaptation to different, sometimes extreme, environments. An improved knowledge of diatom biology is crucial for understanding the basis of their ecological success, for predicting their capability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, including climatic changes due to greenhouse gasses, and for industrial exploitation of their biological properties. The scope of this project is to generate a collection of stable mutants for diatoms through random chemical mutagenesis. Specifically, we want to isolate mutants with altered production of fatty acids, oxylipins and domoic acid, both to characterise the molecular pathways involved and to obtain clones of potential interest to industry. So far genomics and functional data are available for less than 10 of the 200.000 known species, we want to generate a tool that will facilitate molecular studies in these organisms. We have selected the species Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata for our studies because of its ecological relevance in Mediterranean ecosystems and because of its controllable life cycle with known sexual stages. As a preliminary step to this study we plan to exploit new sequencing technologies to sequence the genome of the selected diatom, this will allow to undertake positional cloning once mutants have been isolated and will represent per se a valuable resource. We will contribute to establish a Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata as a model organism and to develop molecular biology and functional genomic resources for diatoms. Ultimately, we want to generate information that will allow a better comprehension of the data and observations that will come from the sea.",0,0

Patients with diabetes are surviving vascular events, living longer, and thus experiencing other adverse outcomes. In the UK despite considerable investments in primary care aimed at identifying and treating CKD in patients with diabetes, CKD is often under-diagnosed and undertreated. Understanding this gap in the implementation and delivery of existing interventions in the UK is the most important purpose of this project. Objectives: 1. Multicentre, series of cross-sectional studies between 2006 and 2010 to describe variations in screening for CKD and resulting treatment as carried out in diabetes after the inclusion of CKD as one of the financially incentivised chronic disease management targets in the Quality and Outcomes Framework, a major pay for performance incentive in UK primary care. We aim to examine the association between patient and practice related factors and screening for CKD, resulting treatment by GPs and process of care measures. 2. Cohort study of incident patients with diabetes with or without CKD followed up over 5 years in order to describe a) longitudinal decline of renal function, b) cardiovascular events, c) all-cause mortality and d) hip fracture. We aim to identify patient and practice-related factors associated with adverse outcomes. Data: Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease dataset (930,000 patients in 129 general practices) in England. Expected results: Our research would provide population-based data on key indicators for health care systems of CKD management in diabetes for the first time after specific interventions were instituted in the UK. We aim to describe for the first time whether nationwide interventions targeting surrogate endpoints in people with diabetes had an effect on adverse clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events, mortality and progression of CKD.",0,0

Especially for the characterisation/inspection of complex geometries or critical featureslocated inside the materials, non destructive imaging technologies are of great advantage. Unfortunately,conventional available non destructive imaging and evaluation methods are either very costly and/or rather slow(e.g X-ray computer tomography) or they do not fulfil the requirements (like standard ultrasonics) for advancedapplications e.g. for high resolution inspection of microparts.This project aims to solve these problems by developing a novel, fast, compact, user-friendly, cost effective(affordable by SMEs) tomographic characterisation tool for industrial applications, based on optical coherencetomography (OCT). The OCT method has been originally developed for medical diagnostics and is intensivelypursued for medical purposes, but not for industrial applications with the effect that there are currently noindustrial OCT-scanners commercially available.In this project, a competent all European consortium, with 10 partners from 5 European countries, covering theset requirements for the development and application of OCT could be established. The consortium includesSMEs as technology providers, supported by the RTD performers, and SMEs as technology users who willdirectly test and evaluate the novel method to shorten process development times and to control their products inthe production process.

The project is a pioneering solution in Europe, where the systems developed by the competitors are based on templates. In addition, many of them belong to food Companies or groups, so have and have a dependence on their brands when setting the menus.  For the moment, a limited technical concept (a basic algorithm) has been developed and tested geographically: the Spanish market.

630,51010,No,IMPROVING DRILLING EFFICIENCY THROUGH REAL-TIME DYNAMICS CONTROL,"In many cases the economics of drilling suffer from a non-optimized adjustement of drilling parameters. Rate of penetration can not be maximized due to the lack of direct information on the drilling process. Complex well geometries often cause a destruction of the drilling BHA because of severe vibrations and the like. The aim of this project is to introduce an innovative instrument for down-hole real-time measurement of drilling parameters, especially dynamics. Demonstration in drilling operation should prove both the tool's integrity and functionality as well as the economic benefits of the new technology. The new measuring instrumentation shall establish a closed information loop between the down-hole drilling process and the surface drilling supervisor. Since effective drilling parameters will be fully under control, the whole process can be optimized by adjusting the drilling regime as required for highest penetration rate and long-term durability of BHA members. Thereby the drilling costs for the operating company as well as the impact on the environment in terms of time of drilling can be substantially reduced.L% Considerable enhancements made to the design of the pilot series tool, providing more and more useful measurements. Additionally the process of memory dump was strikingly improved, thereby adding to the user's acceptance of the CoPilot service. Surface system field verification has been completed by means of real well tests with CoPilot prototype tools. The Drilling Efficiency service will provide real-time display of down-hole drilling characteristics on the rig floor. This will allow the driller to take corrective measures to optimize drilling parameters and to reduce the occurence of undesired drilling phenomena. After the well has been drilled, the customer will be provided with a log plot (and digital record) that can be used both for the post-well analysis of the drilled well, and in the pre-well planning of a future well. The Drilling Efficiency system will also record down-hole drilling forces and motions that improve the understanding of the down-hole drilling environment. The new service will utilize high frequency data from a variety of down-hole sensors including weight-on-bit, torque and bending moment strain gauges, magnetometers, axial and lateral accelerometers and internal and annular pressure sensors. Algorithms embedded in the down-hole tool will process sensor data, compare the actual outputs to pre-determined benchmark values and communicate any variances as a measure of drilling conditions. The information will be presented in real-time, on the rig floor, to enable the driller to take any corrective action. down-hole data will be combined with data from surface sensors to provide further indications of drilling conditions. In addition to real-time information, the Drilling Efficiency service will provide averaged statistical and severity level memory data. Down-hole software requirements are those inherent to providing Drilling Efficiency service, e.g. statistical processing, flagging of drilling diagnostics (severity levels) and tool diagnostics. Diagnostics are tool status logic and data which, in real-time and in memory, inform the user of tool health. The Drilling Efficiency tool will also have the ability to record sensor measurements at high frequencies for later retrieval and analysis at the surface.",0,0
305,72995,No,"Role of the yeast PKB homologue ,Sch9, in nutrient induced signal transduction","Increasing evidence indicates that eukaryotic cells make use of specific nutrient signalling pathways for control of growth and growth-related properties. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein kinase Sch9 plays an important role in nutrient-induced signal transduction and growth control, but the precise mechanisms involved are not well understood. Sequence similarity suggests that protein kinase Sch9 represents the yeast homologue of mammalian protein kinase B (PKB). A role of Sch9 in nutri ent-induced signalling is indicated by the observation that deletion of the SCH9 gene deregulates fermentable growth medium (FGM) signalling. The fermentable growth medium (FGM)-induced pathway maintains activation of protein kinase A targets during gro wth on a fermentable carbon source like glucose. In this project several approaches will be taken to identify new components of the Sch9 nutrient signalling pathway. First, downstream components of Sch9 will be identified as multi-copy suppressor genes o f the growth defect caused by deletion of Sch9 in a specific genetic background. Second, upstream activators of Sch9 will be identified by transposen mutagenesis using a specific genetic background in which inactivation of the upstream components is leth al and can be rescued by induction of Sch9 overexpression. The relationship between the new components identified and other components closely connected to Sch9, such as PKA, Rim15, Yak1 and the two Pkh proteins will be established using epistasis analy sis.

The SENDORA project ideas stem from recent fundamental works on cognitive radio technology.The capability to detect spectrum holes, without interfering with the primary network currently in use, is the actual major difficulty faced by the cognitive radio. The innovative concept proposed in SENDORA project consists in developing a 'sensor network aided cognitive radio' technology which will allow to solve this issue, thanks to the introduction of sensor networks and associated networking capabilities.<br/>The sensor network aided cognitive radio proposed and studied in SENDORA project will address many different advanced techniques, but will also propose an analysis of the potential exploitation of these techniques. First, scenarios of interest will be defined and will provide the technical activities with requirements to cover. Different types of scenarios will be proposed, corresponding to real needs, mainly identified by the potential integrators of the solutions. On the technical point of view, novel spectrum sensing techniques will be first proposed to be able to identify spectrum holes. Corresponding information management and exploitation will be studied to achieve the co-existence of cognitive radios with primary licensed technology without generating harmful interferences.

952,89068,No,Photonic Quantum Information Technology and the Foundations of Quantum Physics in Higher Dimensions,"One of the most important developments in modern physics was the recent emergence of quantum information science, which by its very nature is broadly multidisciplinary. It was started by investigations of the foundations of quantum mechanics, and fundamental quantum concepts, most notably, entanglement, play a key role. We are now at an historic moment where a major qualitative step, both in developing a new technology and applying it to new fundamental questions, can be made. In this proposal, we aim to combine the investigation of fundamental questions with the development of micro-optics technology to reach a new level of both quantum information experiments and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.  We propose to utilize the advanced development of micro-optics to build novel integrated quantum optics photonic chips. High quality micro-optics will allow precise control over many properties, including birefringence, dispersion, periodicity, and even absorptive properties. We will combine this with novel highly efficient detectors, hopefully, in the long run, also integrated into the same microchips.  By their very nature, the new multi-mode devices will make new higher-dimensional regions of Hilbert space and new types of multi-photon entanglement accessible to experiment. Such devices will enable many new fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics, such as, to give just one example, exploring quantum complementarity both between different numbers of photons and as a function of Hilbert space dimension with significant mathematical implications. Most importantly, we are convinced that many new ideas will arise throughout the project.  The new integrated quantum optical chips will also be important in quantum computation, specifically with cluster states and similar complex quantum states. With these chips, we will realize multi-qubit procedures and algorithms and demonstrate the feasibility of all-optical quantum computation in realistic scenarios.",0,0
207,204229,No,"Low cost, early Phytosanitary monitoring and alert service for horticultural farmers","PROBLEM Plant pathogen diseases in horticultural crops are responsible for 35% of crop losses. Today, farmers lack information about disease threats, as there is no way to carry out early diagnosis of the potential diseases that already exist in the soil and surrounding environment. Without this information, the most common practice is to minimise all threats, regardless of whether they exist, by the blanket, widespread application of “wide spectrum” chemical pesticides. However, these methods fail to eliminate all the pathogens effectively, increases production costs and it’s environmentally harmful.  SOLUTION Microgaia is a Spanish SME who has developed a DNA microarray tool that allows rapid and quantitative detection of 200specific plant diseases in a simultaneous way. Microgaia has also developed the associated sampling method and sampling kits to take samples according particularities of each crop, farm plot and aspects as meteorological data, ensuring that results are representative. The use of the entire system, called VegAlert, brings 4 great benefits: - cost reduction (by saving in pesticides) - higher yield (reducing losses caused by pathogens) - preservation of soil quality - compliance with the EU directive No 2009/128/EC  MARKET The utilised agricultural area for horticultural crops surpasses 836.000 thousand hectares in EU-28. Each analysis with VegAlert will be sold at 50 €. On average, 4 samples will be taken for each hectare and per season, this means that the total market size for VegAlert is 3.3 million of potential analysis per year (165 M€). The feasibility study showed that EU farmers are worried by pathogens, and willing to pay for this solution, which minimises their risks of losing production.  BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY This new business line is expected to generate important growth for Microgaia. The business plan predict that by 2022, 18 new jobs will be created with an annual turnover of 7.1 M€ and EBITDA of 3.1 M€.",1,0

Switchgrass is a 3 ligno-cellulosic C4 grass well adapted to most of North Amerika where it is used a.o. for biomass production. Arguments for introducing switchgrass as a biomass crop for energy production in Europe are:   - Low cost of establishment because it is seeded;   - It is cold tolerant;   - High yield potential with low water and fertilizer inputs;   - Wide geographic adaptation.    Some preliminary data collected in Northern Europe indicates that seed establishment is successful and yields are promising. The knowledge generated about this grass in North America and the similarity in climates between its native environment and Europe make introduction of switchgrass for biomass production both very promising and relatively inexpensive. This project also benefits from this, making it very cost effective.    The project will be executed by six partners; Centre for Plant Fibre Research and Biomass Technology Group (NL), Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft Braunschweig-Volkenrode (DE), Rothamsted Experiment Station (GB), Center for Renewable Energy Sources (GR) and Ente per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energie e l'Ambionet (IT).

890,201567,No,Dissecting specific amygdala-striatal circuits for exploration,"Survival and adaptation are dependent on an animal's ability to gain novel information in unfamiliar surroundings. Similar to other animal classes, mammals must use a variety of innate and learned exploratory strategies that are dictated by unpredictable or unknown circumstances. As the combination of emotional processes and planning of complex actions are essential for the development of such strategies, it can be hypothesized that strongly connected brain areas involved in emotions (the amygdala) and goal-directed behaviors (the dorso-medial striatum) have an implication on exploratory behavior. The intricate neuronal nature and brain area specificity in the controlling of such strategies, however, remain elusive. In order to functionally uncover the role of specific amygdala-striatal long-range projections in freely-exploring mice, our collaborative study will adopt a multidisciplinary approach by a) developing a multiple-compartment behavioral task to study the exact evolution of exploratory strategies in a novel environment starting from a familiar one, b) examining the neuronal encoding of amygdala-striatal projecting neurons during exploratory progression using a novel calcium imaging technique in freely-moving animals, and c) causally relating the role of pre- and post- neuronal ensembles to exploratory strategies applying a projection-specific optogenetic approach. Furthermore, the proposed project will employ state-of -the-art techniques to reveal the fine computational mechanism used by animals to explore their surroundings and to determine the neuronal encoding specific to brain-, cell- and projection-types.

Expected Impact World class automotive manufacturing is currently based on the team-working philosophies developed and proved by the Japanese in the 1980's. This approach involves creating multi-functional teams, empowering the 'facts holders' giving them total authority for decision making, and the co-location of teams for high personal motivation. Project TEAM proposes to preserve this 'best practice', but eliminate the necessity for co-location thus enabling manufacturers to utilise European suppliers, SMEs and consultancy expertise irrespective of geographical constraints.   Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Established a Common VIEW Model to facilitate & promote virtual Teamworking across the extended enterprise covering Automotive manufacturers, 2nd & 3rd tier suppliers and SMEs. Developed and trialled an application profile (including Product Library, Decision Support, Multimedia Conferencing and Messaging) and user interface. The network and applications platform were heterogeneous, based on both broadband and narrowband communications, from high performance workstation to low-cost PC, thus addressing the needs of large companies as well as SMEs. Contribution to the programme Introduced key players in the automotive industry supply chain to the concepts and benefits of advanced communications and collaborative working technologies. By eliminating the need for co-location , will enable manufacturers to use European suppliers, SMEs and consultancy expertise irrespective of geographical constraints.  Technical Approach The Project has developed an initial Common View Model which reflects the aspirations of users in terms of communications, applications and organisational needs.  The communication requirements for TEAM applications have been specified to ensure affordable networks offering a good cost/benefit ratio and at the same time respecting bandwith and quality of service requirements. The network design and implementation are to match the latest outputs from standard bodies including ITU-T, ISO, ATM Forum and IETF. As part of the user requirements, special attention is being given to security and confidentiality issues. Collaboration with local National Hosts forms an integral part of the evaluation strategy. The TEAM application profile (including Product Library, Decision Support, Multimedia Conferencing and Multimedia Messaging) and user interface are being developed taking into account current and emerging technologies e.g. Netscape 3, WWW, HTML, VRML and different viewing and conversion tools. Summary of Trial The project has planned a series of field trials, to be conducted with real users, at several locations in the UK, Italy and Ireland.  TEAM has two sets of user trials: Initial evaluation, of three months, started concurrently in mid 1996 at all sites Iterative evaluation, to be conducted at 11 sites in UK, Italy and Ireland, started in March 1997 and continues till the end of the project. In addition to continued user evaluation, the iterative evaluation includes a series of demonstrations to component suppliers, SMEs and senior management of the user partners. Necessary collaboration will be maintained with the local PNOs and National Hosts during trials. The trials include the measurement of critical performance parameters such as quality of service; response time; bandwidth requirements for different applications, individually and collectively; and impact on business processes, cultural and organisational changes. The user trials are planned to be based on a mixture of ATM and ISDN technologies. Key Issues Realisation of a heterogeneous communication infrastructure incorporating public ATM, public SMDS and public ISDN networks  Inter-operability between the TEAM-net and existing networks of the user partners including Ethernet and Token Ring LANs Exploration of different hardware and software options to realise a secure network Continued assessment of applications and adoption of 'best in class' software tools for the final demonstrator Development of business case including costs and benefits analysis and justification for roll-out into business Continued development and population of Product Libraries in formats acceptable to end users.",0,0
887,5244,No,Project on nitrogen physiology of Forest plants and Soils,"NIPHYS (Nitrogen Physiology of Forest Plants and Soils) is an investigation of the present effects of soil-borne and deposited nitrogen on forest organisms and soils along a climatic transect through Europe in order to substantiate predictions on effects of changing depositions and global climate on broad-leaved and coniferous trees.   Investigations on forest decline have demonstrated the importance of nitrogen immissions in enhancing various nutritional imbalances in trees and soil acidification. Nevertheless, we are presently unable to quantify several basic questions: (1) What form of nitrogen is used by trees in different environments, (2) what roles are played by soil properties, mycorrhiza, and microorganisms in the transformation of nitrogen in forest soils, (3) which processes regulate the ammonium/nitrate ratio in soil solution. NIPHYS addresses these issues by investigating plant, microbial, and abiotic processes involved in the transformation of ammonium and nitrate in forest soils of different climatic regions. The project combines botanical, microbiological and soil science. Each participant will work at all study sites. NIPHYS will make comparative studies of the objectives.  General objectives are: (1) to compare broad-leaved and coniferous trees, (2) to quantify the ecosystem internal fluxes of ammonium and nitrate, (3) to identify the sources of nitrate in groundwaters, (4) to develop the capacity to predict future development in forest soils with respect to soil acidification and groundwater quality.  Specific objectives are: (1) to identify potential and actual uptake of organic and inorganic nitrogen by broad-leaf trees, conifers, and mycorrhizae at varied availability of ammonium and nitrate in the soil, (2) to determine actual and potential nitrate reduction in different tree compartments, (3) to quantify aerial uptake of nitrogen by trees, (4) to quantify sorption and immobilization of ammonium in soil organic matter and clay particles, (5) to determine actual and potential nitrification and denitrification and their interaction with various soil redox couples, (6) to determine factors regulating the ammonium/nitrate ratio in soil solution.",1,0
618,2711,No,Subsoil microbiology,"The objective is to obtain quantitative information on the microbial activity in the subsoil which will aid in evaluating the ecological risks and the economic and social benefits of pesticide use.  Field stations were built in 3 countries and equipped with weather stations in order to investigate the risks of chemicals to groundwater purity and subsoil microbiology. Soil air and temperature sampling probes were developed and installed at each station and subsoil temperatures and oxygen partial pressures were monitored. The highest variations in temperatures, oxygen concentrations and carbon dioxide concentrations were in the upper 1 m of soil. Below 2 m and down to 8 m, temperatures at all 3 sites were high enough to allow microbial activity throughout the year. The oxygen content in all layers of the unsaturated zones was high enough to allow year round microbial activity. Soil cores were collected down the profiles at each station. The distribution, composition and activity levels of the microflora in the top soil and in the unsaturated zones of the 3 profiles were investigated. Aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms were found at all depths. In general, the numbers of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased with depth. However, at 2 different sampling sites on the silt loam, bacterial numbers decreased to down to a depth of 3.5 m, and then significantly increased. The microbial biomass of this soil followed a similar pattern. In the other soils, the microbial biomass decreased with increasing depth. With one exception, fungi were not found at any of the sites below 2.5 m. The microflora of the 3 unsaturated zones could readily mineralize various forms of nitrogen, and radiolabelled substrates. They could also degrade and mineralize carbonyl-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and ring labelled 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. In subsoil samples from all 3 sites, there was evidence for adaptation and growth of the microflora on 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. Using data from adsorption isotherm and degradation studies, attempts were made at modelling carbofuran degradation in the different layers of the profiles. In Germany, France and the United Kingdom, field stations, one per country, will be built over aquifers, on frequently occurring agricultural soils, to allow fluxes in prevailing conditions at different depths in the subsoil to be monitored (ie temperature, water potential and the oxygen content of the soil atmosphere). Both classical and new methods will be used to characterize the microflora in homogenized soil samples prepared from cores in 25 cm or 50 cm steps down to the water table. Methods to be used include: colony counts of aerobic bacteria, streptomyces and fungi by plate dilution; counting of anaerobic microorganisms after incubation in chambers depleted of oxygen; counting in soil smears; and analysis of the fungal colonization quotient of soil particles down the soil profile with a soil wash technique. The rate of degradation of naturally occurring carbon and nitrogenous compounds will also be measured.   For comparative purposes, degradation studies with one natural substrate and one radiolabelled pesticide (2,4-D) will be conducted under standardized laboratory conditions. In further tests, degradation of these compounds will also be followed using conditions which simulate those in the individual fields from which the subsoils were collected. These tests will, if possible, also be conducted with a second radiolabelled pesticide (carbofuran and/or atrazine). In addition, the side effects of several chemicals after in situ labelling of the subsoil microflora will be tested.",1,0

700,89107,No,Electronic Response of Single Inorganic Nanowires,"Nanoscale integrated electronics requires building blocks with controlled functional properties. In the continuous strive towards higher integration density, an alternative way of connecting transistors inside a chip is needed. Tertiary inorganic nanowires made up of molybdenum, sulphur and iodine (MoSI) provide a straightforward, scalable synthesis and easy dispersability in a variety of solvents without functionalisation or surfactants. Their connectivity to gold nanoparticles enables self-assembly of networks. To date, their conductivity is limited by energy disorder and defects. This process aims at improving the material by investigating the origin of disorder and defects. To this end, both the basic electrical characterisation as well as the study of the electronic relaxation dynamics via femtosecond spectroscopy will be performed with a spatial resolution down to the individual nanowire. Defects in isolated small nanowire bundles, single nanowires, and networks will be identified with conductive atomic force microscopy. Femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy using a confocal microscope will be performed on the same samples in order to study the electronic processes of individual nanowires and how they change in the presence of defects and nanoparticle junctions.",0,0
233,103338,No,Controls on Megathrust Earthquake Segmentation,"Great subduction earthquakes (with a moment Magnitude of Mw >8) rupture an area of a few thousand square kilometres along a convergent continental margin with coseismic slip up to some tens of meters. However, at certain locations along the continental margin earthquake rupture is suddenly arrested. The spatial extent of the rupture area controls the magnitude of the earthquake and therefore its destructiveness. The recent powerful megathrust earthquakes in Sumatra (2004, 2005), Chile (2010) and Japan (2011) showed that the factors that control extent and limitations of rupture during such earthquakes are highly complex and thus only poorly understood at the moment. This holds true, although the phenomenon of earthquake segmentation has been observed for decades and in spite of the socio-economic impact of this type of earthquake and their associated tsunamis. The overall aim of this project is to increase the understanding of factors that control the area and extent of earthquake rupture and by this also the magnitude of the earthquake. Marine seismic and bathymetry data across earthquake segment boundaries worldwide will be analyzed in order to document structural and morphological variations of the upper overriding and the lower subducting plate which impact on or reflect changes in the physical properties of the plate interface and thus control earthquake segmentation. The output will be an improved understanding of earthquake segmentation at active continental margins. This, in turn, is beneficial for global hazard assessment and mitigation efforts in regions that expect powerful subduction earthquakes in the future.",0,0

656,85162,No,Global approach to brain activity: from cognition to disease,"Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in Nature, and has been considered as one of the engines of life in complex biological systems. Its study has originated new fundamental insights and analysis tools in both local and global dynamical models stemming from divergent disciplines. This proposal aims at determining the functional role of normal and aberrant synchronization mechanisms in the emergence of higher cerebral functions in health and disease, by using tools borrowed from nonlinear dynamics and complexity theory.  Specifically, the present proposal addresses the phenomenon of neuronal synchronization, at a wide range of spatial scales, as a major orchestrator of brain integration processes. To that end, it is necessary to understand how local and long-range interactions scale-up to a global activity in the brain. To accomplish this goal, we will recollect and analyze collective brain responses (multichannel-EEG, intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalographic recordings and local field potentials) and single-neuron activity under different normal and abnormal physiological conditions: from cognitive performance (sensory processing, attention, and memory in humans and non-human primates) to pathological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.  We will apply linear and nonlinear methods, as well as tools from stochastic analysis and from the theories of complex networks and delayed dynamical systems. Such approaches have proven to be very useful in the characterization of complex systems in generic models, and now will be applied for a better understanding of how higher cerebral functions arise in the normal brain. Results from this approach are expected to contribute in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and in the anticipation of epileptic seizures.",0,0
428,107098,No,Precise Predictions for Higgs and New Physics Signals with Jets at the Large Hadron Collider,"'Many of the Higgs and new physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider involve signals with jets of energetic hadrons. This proposal will improve the theoretical predictions for such processes, focusing on three different aspects:  1) Since backgrounds depend on the number of jets, search analyses are often separated into bins with a particular number of jets to improve sensitivity. I propose to improve the precision of these exclusive jet cross sections, through a next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order calculation using the N-jettiness event shape. Improved predictions for the benchmark W\N jet process and the Higgs\N jet signal will be obtained in a form that is suitable for reweighting Monte Carlos. The latter is important for constraining the couplings of the observed new particle at the LHC, which will help establish whether it is the Higgs boson.  2) Given the excellent performance of the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC, there is an expanding interest in techniques that exploit the substructure of jets. I aim to obtain an analytic understanding of the behavior of jet substructure observables and test Monte Carlo simulations, which do not include higher order effects and are the most common tool for substructure analyses. Substructure observables that will be considered include: jet mass, jet charge, 3-subjettiness (relevant for boosted top quarks) and mass-drop/filtering. I propose to investigate the factorization and resummation of these techniques, as well as their calculation beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy of the Monte Carlo parton shower.  3) I also proposes to calculate the collinear radiation in a jet at next-to-next-to-leading order, fully differential in the three body phase-space. This will be used to test at this order the exponentiation of logarithms from jet algorithms, which 'group' the observed radiation into jets. These results are also an important ingredient in other higher-order calculations for processes with jets.'",0,0
976,205254,No,Smart Synchronous inverter for grid’s stability,"One of the key areas when it comes to Smart Grids is the safe integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Distributed Energy Storage systems (DES) onto the electric network. Nowadays RESs (solar, wind, etc.) and DES systems are connected to the grid via DC/AC converters (inverters). Currently these inverters do not provide the ancillary services required to avoid grid fluctuations derived from a growing share of RESs connected to the grid. Inverters playing an active role in grid stabilisation can efficiently mitigate some of the drawback that RESs have from an electric grid operator point of view such as transient grid-voltage fluctuations or frequency deviations. Synvertec, an Israeli company seed-funded by Horizon Green Tech Ventures (an investment alliance formed by Alstom S.A., Rotem Industries Ltd. and Gefen Investments) has developed and patented the Synchronverter, a system which connected to a standard inverter mimics the operation of a synchronous generator. Synchronverter integrates with existing inverters und turns them in effect into a virtual synchronous generator device being able to (i) actively respond to frequency changes and stabilize the voltage and (ii) imitate the inherent mechanical inertia of synchronous generators. The inverter market for renewable energy accounted in 2014 for more than €8.68 billion and is expected to exceed the €13.5 billion in 2017. Europe is the largest contributor with a 60% of the market and a revenue of €5.2 billion in 2014. The European market segment below 100 kW accounts for 85% of the total. Synvertec has founded a consortium with two German companies (an inverter manufacturer: Solutronic Energy, and an inverter supplier: Q3 Energie) to integrate their solution into commercial inverters and boost the deployment of the final solution into the market thanks to the well-stablished sales channels of those partners.",0,0
259,218383,No,Resurrecting LUCA - Engineering of RNA-encoded Cellular Life Using Dual Evolution and Intergenomic Transplantation,"Modern cellular life strictly depends on DNA as genetic material. However, a large body of evidence infers the existence of a previous, more primitive biology in which RNA also stored information in cellular entities. Recreating a living cellular fossil representing this transition from an ancient RNA world to modern DNA-based life would fundamentally advance our understanding of our biology’s history, and enable us to explore its biological properties experimentally. However, the reengineering of existing molecular systems into a viable doppelganger of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) or one of its precursors is extremely challenging.   I propose to use a novel, combined top-down and bottom-up approach to create a modern-day doppelganger of LUCA by engineering bacterial hybrids with core cellular functions encoded on RNA. Using Darwinian Evolution as driver, my team and I will prototype and refine synthetic RNA-replicons through alternating replication in both cell-free and intracellular environments. This “dual evolution” approach will shape increasingly complex RNA networks capable of encoding complex genetic information. Following this, we will use these networks to create information-rich RNA chromosomes, enabling the transfer of essential genomic information from DNA to RNA. Finally, we will address this intergenomic transplantation by combining a novel RNA-delivery strategy with iterative rounds of genome deletion and complementation using state-of-the art CRISPR-Cas9 assisted genome editing.  The proposed research will fundamentally advance synthetic biology, and could positively answer the transformative questions: Can we create, program and evolve life-like systems that can survive in both cell-free and intracellular environments? Can we use these entities to construct an alternative biology in which central cellular activities are encoded on genomes not made of DNA?",0,0

The technologies are activated riparian zones/wetlands;  smart biomass containing carriers for treatment of water in open trenches; in-situ technologies to restore degraded surface water by inhibiting influx of pollutants from groundwater to surface water;  multifunctional permeable barriers and injectable Fe-based particles for rehabilitation of groundwater. Methods will be developed to determine the (long-term) impact of the innovative rehabilitation technologies on the reduction of the influx of these priority pollutants towards the receptor. A connection between the innovative technologies and river basin management will be worked out.  In a first stage of the project, the technologies and integration of their impact in river basin management will be developed in three different river basins (Denmark, Israel, Belgium). In a second stage, the generic approaches will be extrapolated to one or two more river basins.  One of the major outcomes of the project will be a generic river basin management tool that integrates multiple measures with ecological and economic impact assessments of the whole water system. The research in the project is focussed on innovative rehabilitation strategies to reduce priority pollutants in the water system whereas the generic management tool will include other measures related to flood protection, water scarcity and ecosystem health, The project will aid in underpinning river basin management plans being developed in EU Member States, and will demonstrate cost effective technologies that can provide technical options for national and local water managers, planners and other stakeholders (drinking water companies, industry, agriculture,",1,0
25,74148,Yes,New strategies to improve grain legumes for food and feed,"The EU faces the challenge of providing high quality protein for both animal and human consumption. Europe currently imports about 70% of its plant protein yet much of this could be derived from EU grown Grain Legumes. In the human diet Grain Legumes are beneficial and they provide an excellent source of high quality plant protein for animal feed. Furthermore, legume use in arable crop rotations reduces the need for fertiliser application and acts as a break-crop, reducing the need for pest and disease control. Together this is a unique combination of benefit to the environment. Nevertheless, grain legumes are underused by European farmers mainly because of yield inconsistency. Additionally there has been insufficient research into the effects of legume seed composition on the quality of animal feed. The GRAIN LEGUMES Integrated Project will mobilise and integrate European scientific research on grain legumes to solving these problems, by addressing the following objectives; i) To identify optimal parameters for legumes in feed quality and safety, including GMOs while using legumes to develop healthy and sustainable agriculture, ii) To investigate variation in grain legume seed composition and the factors affecting it. iii) To develop new genetic, genomic, post-genomic and bioinformatic tools to improve and sustain grain legume seed production and quality. To achieve these objectives the project will integrate an ambitious combination of approaches, including biochemistry, plant & crop physiology, agronomy, plant genomics & breeding, and animal nutritional studies. Particular emphasis will be placed upon the use of state-of-the-art methodologies including genomics and bioinformatics, together with transcriptomics and metabolomics.",1,1
791,219736,No,"Re-inventing Paint – A Pioneering, Dry Paint Film for Radio Frequency Identification applications","With WaveShield we aim to re-invent paint for RFID applications. Our goal is to commercialize a dry, non-toxic, 100% effective RFID shielding solution with enhanced environmental and applications aspects, aiming to replace the conventional shielding liquid paints. Conductive liquid paints are the most used solution for RFID shielding. They present a competitive quality/price ratio but the application process is complicated (9-step process) and time consuming (three to five days). Durability (dripping, cracking) and thickness control are also a challenge as they often generate shielding ineffectiveness (RFID signals go through holes or too thin layer of paint). Moreover, their VOCs content, along with the odor and dust emission during application, can have serious adverse health effects on workers and significant environmental impact. Thus, the RFID technology market is in need of a more effective, cleaner, enhanced alternative solution to prevent identification errors, simplify the application procedure and reduce the environmental impact. WaveShield technology is a pioneering, VOC-free, 100% effective shielding, ready-to-use dry paint film with an embedded and mastered shielding function. It has high durability and the application procedure is a clean, simplified 3-step process, applied in only one day, without the need to remove or cover items or evacuate the space to be coated. We create a cost-efficient coating technology at a competitive price (€30/m2) that can be applied by coating professionals through standard application techniques. CORSO MAGENTA is a pioneering start-up SME, expert in alternative coating products since its foundation in 2007. Since then, we have spent €2.6M on R&D to find an innovative solution and face those challenges.  Through this project, we aim to reach revenues of about €17 million after the fifth year of commercialization and create at least 35 new job positions. With a Phase 2 investment of €1.49M, this would imply a ROI of 4.55.",0,0

The Fellowship will lead to articles in world-class journals and long-term projects and collaborations.  The field of mathematical finance is a cutting edge domain of applied mathematics. It is an increasingly important multi-disciplinary field involving business, finance, banking and assurance issues, which is based on modern probability theory. Jan Obloj will join the dynamic research group in Mathematical Finance at Imperial College and participate fully in its program, including seminars and rich interactions with industrial partners.  He will work together with Professor Mark Davis on hedging problems in incomplete markets driven by CGMY model. This elegant model which addresses fundamental flaws of classical Black-Scholes models is becoming an active and important research topic.

The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to study the chromatin architecture during normal and malignant T cell differentiation in order to define how DNA methylation drives oncogenic gene expression as a novel concept in cancer research.  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounts for 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases and was originally identified as a highly aggressive tumor entity. T-ALL therapy has been intensified leading to gradual improvements in survival. However, 20% of pediatric and 50% of adult T-ALL cases still relapse and ultimately die because of refractory disease. Research efforts have unravelled the complex genetic basis of T-ALL but failed to identify new promising targets for precision therapy.   Recent studies have identified a subset of T-ALLs whose transcriptional programs resemble those of early T-cell progenitors (ETPs), myeloid precursors and hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, these so-called ETP-ALLs are characterized by early treatment failure and an extremely poor prognosis. The unique ETP-ALL gene expression signature suggests that the epigenomic landscape in ETP-ALL is markedly different as compared to other genetic subtypes of human T-ALL.  My project aims to identify genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications in genetic subtypes of human T-ALL as a basis for elucidating how DNA methylation drives the expression of critical oncogenes in the context of poor prognostic ETP-ALL. Given that these ETP-ALL patients completely fail current chemotherapy treatment, tackling this completely novel aspect of ETP-ALL genetics will yield new targets for therapeutic intervention in this aggressive haematological malignancy.",0,0

These will be analysed with respect to the following questions: - What kinds of management instruments are used to solve environmental problems and how effective are they? - What kinds of original rules and institutional arrangements are implemented and which economic governance models have been established? - What crucial aspects must be considered when transferring these solutions to other communities that face similar problems? - What is the capacity of CSOs and their networks for contributing to finding, implementing and transferring such solutions? Based on the findings, CiVi.net wants to facilitate the transfer of successful solutions to at least one other community for each selected case study region confronted with similar environmental challenges. To do so, CiVi.net will develop an ex-ante assessment approach to test the transferability of institutional solutions and of successful governance models. One of the final outputs will be a manual to assist practitioners and scientists on how to design and manage the knowledge transfer. CiVi.net will put much emphasis on the dissemination of the produced knowledge. Thus, another of its final outputs will be an innovative web-based data portal for providing and trading knowledge.",0,0
368,2713,No,A unifying concept for the assessment of the bio-availability and leachability of cadmium and zinc,"The objective is to develop a laboratory technique in which the plant uptake response to concentrations and activities of cadmium and zinc (cadmium(2\) ions and zinc(2\) ions) in soil solution can be measured and to determine whether plants respond closely to these under different soil conditions (pH, metal load) and what is the influence of intensity and capacity.  A project has been set up to investigate plant uptake response to concentrations and activities of cadmium and zinc ions in soil solution. In particular the objectives were:  to establish a method of sampling soil solution and solve remaining problems regarding speciation of small samples of soil solution;  to monitor changes over 1 year in cadmium and zinc solubility after spiking to 10 levels of cadmium or zinc of two soils of different pH;  to assess a new method of linking nutrient additions to plant transpiration;  to further test the hypothesis that plant uptake of cadmium and zinc is determined by solution ion activity and mass flow. 8 major experiments were conducted:  experiment A: a method of cadmium and zinc speciation was developed for 50 ml samples of soil solution down to 0.1 ppb cadmium and 1 ppb zinc concentrations;  experiment B: the ion exchange speciation method for cadmium or zinc was compared to a fractionation method by dialysis;  experiment C: a new pressure method of obtaining leachate was compared to the water displacement method for planted and unplanted pots. Organic carbon and potassium in solution were not increased in the pressure solutions;  experiment D: the exact point of breakthrough of added water in the displacement method was determined using chromatographical analysis. More solution could be obtained from unplanted pots before breakthrough;  experiment E: changes over time of cadmium and zinc uptake by radish were assessed by sampling 10 times during plant growth. Uptake of cadmium and zinc seemed to be related to ion activity in soil solution;  experiment F: the effect of variations in cadmium and zinc concentration and activity in soil solution was studied in a plant experiment using soils varying in metal load or pH. Increases in cadmium and zinc in soil solution were positively correlated to plant uptake of cadmium or zinc from polluted but not from uncontaminated soils;  experiment G: it was found that mass flow explains some of the variation in cadmium and zinc uptake between species;  experiment H: 2 uncontaminated soils of different pH were spiked to 10 levels of either cadmium or zinc and incubated. It was found that no precipitation had occurred after 7 months of incubation. Phase 1 involves the development of methods and testing of concepts. The hypothesis to be tested is that plant uptake response can be related to either the concentration or activity of cadmium and zinc present in the soil solution. A conceptual model will be built up from the results of pot experiments in soil using plant species that are widely grown in Europe (eg a graminaceous species, a dicotyledon). Factors to be tested in Phase 1 are those that influence both soil solution metal content and the chemical species present:  pH, 3 levels (2 contrasting soil types, with 3 different long established pHs of each, are available at Rothamsted);  metal loading, 4 or 5 levels (more in the initial experiments to establish response curves);  and metal addition, cadmium or zinc as sulphate salts.   Phase 2 involves the use of the developed concepts on different soils. About 15 soils will be collected from different countries to give a range of soil types and properties (range of pH, organic matter and textures representing the variety of European soils) and also different forms of pollution. These should include natural mineralization, mining waste, industrial effluents, disposal of sewage sludge, disposal of dredged materials, fallout from smelters, and normal agricultural soils with little pollution present. The choice of soils will be coordinated with the Community Bureau of Reference who are coordinating trials of methods for chemical speciation of metals in soil and sediment.These soils will be used in experiments like those above and both uptake of metals and full characterization of the metals in soil solution will be done.   Phase 3 involves the development of a simple testing procedure. From the concepts derived in Phase 1 and 2 a procedure will be developed that will be more simple but still capable of providing the information necessary to indicate the relative risk of the metal contamination present in any soil. Extraction with neutral salts seems to be promising because essentially those mimic soil solution. Present methods using calcium chloride, however, are unable to account for the effect that differences in soil solution calcium concentration have on uptake by plants. Therefore salts such as strontium chloride will be tried out, as strontium is chemically similar to calcium but will permit measurement of the calcium concentration in the extract.",0,0
857,198674,No,Early Microbial Evolution,"From the primordial emergence of the earliest cells to the ongoing diversification of modern microbiota, the mechanisms that underlie the origin of major prokaryotic groups are still poorly understood. In principle, the origin of both species and higher taxa among prokaryotes should entail similar mechanisms — ecological interactions with the environment paired with natural genetic variation involving lineage-specific gene innovations and lineage-specific gene acquisitions. Because eukaryotes started out as a prokaryote lineage, the same holds true at the prokaryote-eukaryote transition. Prokaryotic higher taxa are currently circumscribed by phylogenomic studies encompassing 30-40 proteins for information processing that are universal to all genomes, or nearly so. The core is useful in taxonomy but comprises only about 1% of an average genome. It does not predict gene content in the remaining 99% of the genome, because of the role of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in generating diversity within and between prokaryotic groups. Especially in groups with large pangenomes or broad ecological diversity, the core itself does not reveal which gene innovations underlie the origin of major groups, but gene distributions might. This proposal aims to harness all the evolutionary data that genomes have to offer — gene trees, gene distributions, and split distributions across sets of trees — to chart the history of the 99% component of microbial genome evolution and the role of LGT in the origin of higher microbial taxa. The focus is on three important questions: i) What are the quantitative and lineage specific relative contributions of gene transfer from endosymbionts vs. gene transfers from other prokaryotes during eukaryotic genome evolution, ii) Are there significant differences in verticality in comparisons of genome evolution in prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes and how can we statistically better quantify them, and iii) What was the biological nature of the earliest prokaryotes.",0,0

Based on regional links, collaboration and expertise in science and education the Medical Faculties of the Universities of Copenhagen, Kiel and Lund have established the Baltic Summer School (BSS) to combine their efforts in training of young researchers. BSS_2000 will concentrate on highly relevant topics of immunology and signal transduction.  It will focus on (i) the molecular and cellular basis of the innate and adaptive immune system; (ii) the interdisciplinary processes of signal transduction, including death receptors, intracellular signalling cascades, significance of lipid second messengers; (iii) selected applied aspects as the immune response against transplanted tissue and tumours. These fields have dramatically expanded because of the rapid scientific development and the need to cope with chronic progressive diseases, which are an economic burden to Society. BSS_2000 is thus timely from a scientific, technological and socio-economic point of view. The project is important for understanding basic mechanisms, but at the same time highly relevant for the development of new therapeutic strategies in clinical conditions as transplantation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infection. Thus, it addresses a wide scientific community, from researchers in basic sciences to physicians working in clinical research. BSS_2000 will be open for 65 young researchers from all over Europe. State-of -the-art lectures by international experts in the respective fields will illuminate the theoretical background and practical applications. Plenary and round table discussions, seminars, and demonstrations by scientifically profiled biomedical companies will supplement the training project.

143,200197,Yes,"High Nature Value Farming: Learning, Innovation and Knowledge.","'High nature value (HNV) farmland designates “those areas in Europe where agriculture is a major land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both”. They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure. For national and local authorities, the European Union and the Common Agricultural Policy, and for stakeholders, the challenge is twofold:  •  to avoid further degradation and disappearance of HNV farming and increase their socio-economic viability: this could be done by collating, evaluating and disseminating innovations as tools for their development;  • to maintain their “natural value”, i.e the environmental services they provide to the society.  For these reasons, our consortium, an EIP Agri Focus Group and new partners, propose a network dedicated to supporting HNV farming, networking HNV areas covering a range of different farming systems across the EU, and to focussing on innovations improving simultaneously “socio-economic viability” and “environmental efficiency”.  Conceived as a “support service” for knowledge and innovation exchanges, the HNV-Link network will give a decisive new impetus to this sector, and will provide tools to organisations, actors and networks supporting HNV farmlands. The marginality of HNV areas in conventional research and development means that HNV farming-related innovation is rarely discussed in academic exchanges. Our thematic network, both grassroots-based and transnational, can really make a difference, by connecting farmers and innovation actors in line with the vision of the EIP-Agri “operational groups'.

570,220857,No,spontaneous Evolution and Clonal heterOgeneity in MoNoclonal Gammopathies: from mechanisms of progression to clinical management,"As an onco-hematologist with a strong expertise in genomics, I significantly contributed to the understanding of multiple myeloma (MM) heterogeneity and its evolution over time, driven by genotypic and phenotypic features carried by different subpopulations of cells. MM is preceded by prevalent, asymptomatic stages that may evolve with variable frequency, not accurately captured by current clinical prognostic scores. Supported by preliminary data, my hypothesis is that the same heterogeneity is present early on the disease course, and identification of the biological determinants of evolution at this stage will allow better prediction of its evolutionary trajectory, if not its control. In this proposal I will therefore make a sharp change from conventional approaches and move to early stages of MM using unique retrospective sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling. To identify clonal MM cells in the elderly before a monoclonal gammopathy can be detected, I will collect bone marrow (BM) from hundreds of hip replacement specimens, and analyze archive peripheral blood samples of thousands of healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. This will identify early genomic alterations that are permissive to disease initiation/evolution and may serve as biomarkers for clinical screening. Through innovative, integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of hundreds of asymptomatic MMs, I will functionally dissect heterogeneity and characterize the BM microenvironment to look for determinants of disease progression. Correlation with clinical outcome and mini-invasive serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA will identify candidate biological markers to better predict evolution. Last, aggressive modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens will offer a list of vulnerabilities that could be exploited for rationale therapies. These methodologies will deliver a paradigm for the use of molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer.",0,0

909,73043,No,Mouse models to analyse the role of telomerase in cancer and aging,"Chromosomal ends have protective structures named telomeres that distinguish them from broken chromosomes. Telomeres are composed of tandem G-rich DNA repeats bound to an array of proteins that are essential for telomere capping. The synthesis of telomeres by telomerase and their function are proposed to be biological determinants in the process of cancer and aging. Telomere dysfunction because of short telomeres or mutation of telomere-binding proteins can lead to chromosomal end-to-end fusions and loss of cell viability. I will test the relevance of telomeres and telomerase in tumour development and aging using mouse models deficient for proteins that are important for telomere function, such as telomerase (Tere knock-out mice) and telomeric binding proteins (Ku86 and DNA-PKcs knock-out mice). Further I will study transgenic mice overexpressing the catalytic subunit of telomerase (mTert) in adult tissues that normally lack telomerase to directly analyse the impact of telomerase upregulation for tumour growth and ageing. I will test whether telomerase cooperates with loss of p53 in tumorigenesis using telomerase transgenic p53 knockout mice. Additionally I will evaluate the role of telomeres and telomerase in tumourigenesis by analysing double mutant mice lacking telomerase, with an activatingCdk4 R24C mutation, present in human hereditary melanoma. The analysis of these different mouse models should help to understand the function of telomerase intelomere maintenance, cancerogenesis and age-associated diseases.",0,0
140,210676,Yes,Use of Extremophile Bacterium XT1 in Biological Approach to Promote Plant Growth and Tackle Pathogens,"Securing sustainable food production whilst preserving ecosystem services has become imperative following the growing trend of population and the increasing need in environment protection. Traditional agricultural methods are called to introduce changes to meet these challenges. One of the main threats posed to global food security is plant diseases, commonly treated with chemicals responsible for toxic effects and biodiversity disorders.  The present project proposes XTOnE, an organic alternative to chemicals based on the patented extremophile bacterium XT1, whose innovative concept lies on the unique characteristics of this microorganism. XT1 enables induced mechanisms in plants raising self-defense against external pathogens and stresses, stimulating nutrition efficiency and uptake and improving growth and quality.  The expected outcome is a product that acts contemporarily as biostimulant, biofertiliser and organic pest controller whose benefits on plants are preserved even in extreme conditions.  XTOnE addresses the need of farmers by guaranteeing a plant protection throughout the entire life-cycle and reducing losses. It can be grown into organic wastes allowing the reuse of leftovers and unlocking the agriculture potential in delivering the objectives of the Circular Economy. Its first application will be against a worldwide fungal disease, Verticillium, attacking more than 200 species and affecting especially Europe. XTOnE raised the interest of companies with a European and International presence, due to the lacking of similar solution. Thanks to its easy-of-use and affordable price, it projected to have European and global commercial potential.

908,196782,No,Long-Term Investment,"The typical 20th-century firm was capital-intensive and competed on cost efficiency.  The 21st-century firm is different.  Competitive success increasingly depends on product quality, which in turn hinges on intangible assets such as brand strength, innovation, and corporate culture.  Unlike tangible investment such as buying a factory, the fruits of intangible investment may take several years to appear.  A manager pressured to maximise short-term earnings may fail to invest, jeopardising the long-term future of his firm.  This project will study the determinants and consequences of long-term investment through three linked components.  Financial Markets.  The traditional view is that financial markets dissuade investment by forcing firms to cater to short-term shareholders.  I will study two channels through which markets promote investment.  First, traders gather information about a firm’s past investments and incorporate it into stock prices by trading - rewarding the manager for good investment.  Second, traders can gather information about a firm’s future investment opportunities - informing the manager about his future investment decisions.  I aim to analyse what determines the efficiency of both channels.   Incentives.  Most research on incentives focuses on either the level of pay, or the sensitivity of pay to performance, but it is the horizon of incentives that is key to promoting investment.  I will theoretically analyse the optimal incentive horizon, and empirically demonstrate how it affects long-term decisions.  Moving beyond managers, I will study how to incentivise teachers to focus on their pupils’ long-run development rather than “teaching-to-the-test.”  Effects of Investment.

88,214751,Yes,Innovative tools for rational control of the most difficult-to-manage pests (super pests) and the diseases they transmit,"Among the most acute challenges that many producers of fruit and vegetable crops currently face are a subset of arthropod pest species - namely aphids, whiteflies, thrips and mites - that are extremely difficult to control (the “super pests”). These issues have been caused, in part, by the over reliance on synthetic insecticides and novel methods of control are urgently required. The SuperPests project aims to meet this need by developing and evaluating a suite of innovative products, tools and concepts, and integrating these with existing approaches in data driven Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs. These control strategies will ensure the effective and sustainable control of the “super pests”, with substantially reduced use of pesticides. To achieve this SuperPests will develop multiplex and automated sample-to-answer diagnostics (biotypes, infection status and insecticide resistance profile), evaluate biopesticides (green chemistry – plant extracts & metabolites, synergists, RNAi and bio-stimulants), study host plant resistance to pests and  compatibility with biological control, select natural enemies better suited to certain crops and IPM, and develop predictive mathematical models, iteratively validated against experimental data, to determine optional combinations for IPM. Successful completion of the deliverables of SuperPests will create opportunities for the commercial exploitation of the new tools and products. The previous experience of the consortium members with a whole range of multi-actor and multidisciplinary approaches and cutting-edge translational technologies, the extensive synergies with parallel large international programs, and the inclusion of appropriate companies places the SuperPests team in a strong position to generate knowledge and create smart tools and practices which ensure pest control while protecting the environment and human health.",1,1

The rise of freelancer movement together with new ways of organizing work have dramatically changed the economic landscape. In this new environment the value creation happens in global talent networks, and the potential for disruptive innovations is embedded in the dispersed, decentralized organizations and teams. New challenges resulting from this development require effective tools to enable business environment and the entire society to adapt. As a result, platform thinking is gaining momentum in the innovation management field. Various platforms and especially so called competence platforms are anticipated to dramatically boost the global economy through improved productivity and higher degree of workforce utilization. According to a recent McKinsey’s foresight, online talent platforms can boost the global GDP by USD 2,7 trillion by 2025. And this is exactly the area where Part-up is going to have global impact! In contrast to trading platforms, where a few global vendors have evidently gained huge market capitalization, the competence platform segment is still a battlefield open for emerging solutions.

948,73989,No,Innovative In Situ CO2 Capture Technology for Solid Fuel Gasification (ISCC),"The new process technology proposed is based on steam gasification of low rank, high moisture brown coal, which includes the high temperature removal of CO2 by using high temperature efficient sorbent materials. The combination of both, the gasification and the in situ CO2 capture initiates a shift reaction in product gas composition towards H2. Experiments with different hydrocarbons and dolomite revealed that hydrogen concentrations higher than 95 vol % can be achieved using this technology.

788,211096,No,Concept of Operations for EuRopean UTM Systems,"The drone business sector is growing rapidly, but in Europe today is held back by the absence of a harmonized approach for the integration of drones into Very Low Level (VLL) airspace. The CORUS (Concept of Operation for EuRopean UTM Systems) project gathers experts from aviation (manned and drone), research and academia to develop a reference Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for UTM (UAS Traffic Management) in VLL airspace in Europe. Building on the state-of-the-art, CORUS will develop an operational concept enabling safe interaction between all airspace users in VLL considering contingencies and societal issues. Specifically CORUS will: 1. Establish a CONOPS for nominal situations, developing use cases for major scenarios 2. Address drones operations in the vicinity of airfields and controlled airspace and for transfer between controlled and non-controlled airspaces. 3. Describe how losses of safety in non-nominal drone situations can be minimized. 4. Examine non-aviation aspects, identifying key issues for society and offering solutions to ease social acceptance 5. Identify necessary technical developments, quantifying the level of safety and performance required The broad acceptance of the CORUS CONOPS is paramount. To this end CORUS will establish a “UTM community Network” drawing on a wide range of stakeholders, to guide and review the development through a series of workshops. A subset of the “UTM community Network” will form an Advisory Board to review draft documents and answer questions. Through these bodies coordination with other ongoing research and rulemaking initiatives from the European Commission, EUROCAE, EASA, JARUS and NASA’s UTM research project will be ensured, as well as the regular interaction with the Work Area 2 projects of the same Call. Comprehensive communication and dissemination activities will be implemented to ensure the widest possible outreach of the project outcomes throughout the project’s life.",0,0

Secondary objectives:   - To develop chromatographic/mass spectrometric methods for trace analysis of food contaminants, such that real time monitoring becomes possible;   - To develop and validate a set of rapid, low cost in-vitro test systems for the screening of the toxic potency of food contaminants;   - To integrate these methods to design suitable monitoring systems for the food industry;   - To evaluate and harmonize analytical and toxicological test methods for safety evaluation procedures at the European level.  Rapid and in vitro toxicological and analytical test systems for screening food contaminants and natural toxins are under development. Such tests will provide rapid food quality measurement techniques for detection and safety assessment. The following aspects with respect to the development of real time analytical methodology were identified for the Concerted Action 'In Vitro Toxicological Studies and Real Time Analysis of Residues in Food': method development for sample introduction into a tandem monitoring system; automation of sample introduction; sample pretreatment procedures to ensure minimum handling and rapid throughput; back up analysis by chromatography; production of reference materials.  With respect to the development of cell culture methodology the Concerted Action identified the following aspects: isolation and characterization of cell organelles, primary cellcultures, and cell lines; biotransformation profiles of xenobiotics; characterization of Cyt P-450 isoenzymes; adduct formation between xenobiotics and cellular macromolecules; animal species and sex dependency of metabolic pathways; mode of action and molecular mechanisms of toxicity of xenobiotics; in vivo validation in target and test animals.  In a series of workshops scientific papers were presented and the subjects ranged from instrumental approaches to residue analysis to detailed analytical procedures for defined classes of compounds or individual xenobiotics. The available analytical instrumentation seemed sufficient for sensitive analysis of individual compounds and therefore efforts to improve sample preparation and pretreatment were considered with high priority. Papers were presented on the isolation and maintenance of various in vitro toxicological systems and how these systems are being used for toxicology problems. Research into the use of in vitro techniques showed clearly the advantages and limitations of these systems for risk assessment purposes. As regards th e level of external flora, there are a large number of yeasts, from 5E7 to E10/g. The presence of bacteria resistant to salt, such as Micrococaccae and Brevibacterium were also found. The project attempts to develop rapid and in vitro toxicological and analytical test systems for screening of foodcontaminants and natural toxins. There is a strong need for such tests given the large number of food contaminants and the costs of traditional protocol safety testing. Moreover the food industry has to meet nowadays demands of consumers which tend to be more and more stringent with respect to the presence of contaminants in food. For that purpose this Action has brought together scientists from eleven EC and EC affiliated countries, with a common interest in the safety of residues of foodcontaminants, but coming from different scientific disciplines, namely toxicology and analytical chemistry.   The following aspects were identified for this Concerted Action:   1. Development of Real-Time Analytical Methodology   - method development for sample introduction into tandem MS;   - automation of sample introduction;   - sample pretreatment procedures to ensure minimum handling and rapid throughput;   -back up analysis by chromatography;   - production of reference materials.   2. Development of Cell Culture Methodology:   - isolation and characterization of cell organelles, primary cellcultures, and cell lines;   - biotransformation profiles of xenobiotics;   - characterization of Cyt P-450 isoenzymes;   - adduct formation between xenobiotics and cellular macromolecules;   - animal species and sex dependency of metabolic pathways;   - mode of action and molecular mechanisms of toxicity of xenobiotics;   - in-vivo validation in target and test animals.",1,0
800,90222,No,"Metabolic control by the TGF-² superfamily receptor ALK7: A novel regulator of insulin secretion, fat accumulation and energy balance","The aim of this proposal is to understand a novel regulatory signaling network controlling insulin secretion, fat accumulation and energy balance centered around selected components of the TGF-² signaling system, including Activins A and B, GDF-3 and their receptors ALK7 and ALK4. Recent results from my laboratory indicate that these molecules are part of paracrine signaling networks that control important functions in pancreatic islets and adipose tissue through feedback inhibition and feed-forward regulation. These discoveries have open up a new research area with important implications for the understanding of metabolic networks and the treatment of human metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes and obesity.  To drive progress in this new research area beyond the state-of-the-art it is proposed to: i) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Activins regulate Ca2\ influx and insulin secretion in pancreatic ²-cells; ii) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of GDF-3 on adipocyte metabolism, turnover and fat accumulation; iii) Investigate the interplay between insulin levels and fat deposition in the development of insulin resistance using mutant mice lacking Activin B and GDF-3; iv) Investigate tissue-specific contributions of ALK7 and ALK4 signaling to metabolic control by generating and characterizing conditional mutant mice; v) Investigate the effects of specific and reversible inactivation of ALK7 and ALK4 on metabolic regulation using a novel chemical-genetic approach based on analog-sensitive alleles.  This is research of a high-gain/high-risk nature. It is posed to open unique opportunities for further exploration of complex metabolic networks. The development of drugs capable of enhancing insulin secretion, limiting fat accumulation and ameliorating diet-induced obesity by targeting components of the ALK7 signaling network will find a strong rationale in the results of the proposed work.",0,0
1066,89561,No,Functional in vivo two-photon imaging of fear memory traces in identified neuronal networks of the amygdala,"Memory formation is one of the most sophisticated and fascinating functions of the nervous system. Our brains remain plastic throughout life and enable us to store and access an amount of information that no computer could cope with. While the physiological mechanisms underlying learning have been studied extensively using in vitro preparations, much less is known about how memories are stored at the level of local neuronal circuits in the intact animal. This is an essential question since the dynamic interaction of neurons in their networks is absolutely critical to any form of higher brain function.  This proposal outlines a strategy to elucidate how memory formation and extinction alters the activation patterns of local, identified neuronal networks. We will apply a novel and multi-disciplinary approach which combines the recently devised technique of in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using GRIN lenses with established molecular (transgenic mouse lines) and behavioural (fear conditioning) approaches. This will enable us to optically record the activity of many neurons simultaneously and to discern the two major neuronal populations, principal neurons and interneurons, which have opposing roles in the brain. This strategy will be used to study how fear memories manifest themselves in the mouse amygdala. In addition, we will characterise the mechanisms of fear generalisation and extinction. These phenomena are implicated in several human anxiety disorders which afflict an estimated 13% of the population in the EU. Our results will help to better understand the underlying causes of these conditions and potentially reveal novel strategies for pharmaceutical intervention. In addition, this research will define novel concepts on memory storage at the network level, which will be of great interest to the scientific community as well as society at large.",0,0
777,89588,No,Development of ab initio based classical interaction potentials for the study of the structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions and interfaces,"We propose theoretical and computational studies aimed at understanding the role of aqueous solutions and interfaces relevant to atmospheric problems.  In particular, we propose to study the effect of ions, salts and acids on the structural and dynamical properties of the aqueous/vapor interface.  These chemical species have been known to play an important role in various atmospheric processes. Understanding their solvation, propensity and transport at aqueous interfaces is necessary in order to address atmospheric problems resulting from man made chemical processing.  Experimental techniques, such as vibrational spectroscopy, provide only indirect structural information of pure liquids and surface-active solutes in the region of interface. A more direct determination of the interfacial properties can be achieved via molecular simulation.  A caveat in interpreting the results of molecular simulations and comparing them with experiment lies in the accuracy of the representation of the underlying molecular interactions. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, we propose (i) to develop accurate classical models of the intermolecular interactions based on the use of high-level electronic structure calculations (ii) to develop general codes for classical and quantum statistical mechanical simulations and their efficient implementation on parallel computer architectures, (iii) to perform simulations of the structural and dynamical properties of the aqueous/vapor interface with an emphasis on the importance of nuclear quantum effects and (iv) to directly compare our theoretical predictions with experimental (spectroscopic) measurements.",0,0
1040,107488,No,A path to understanding: precision studies of the Higgs boson through Weak Boson Fusion,"Evidence for the production of the long sought after Higgs boson has recently been presented from the ATLAS and CMS multipurpose experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, at an invariant mass of approximately 125 GeV. While this represents a major achievement in and of itself, it represents only the beginning of a long programme of detailed study to investigate this new particle: its properties and their implications. The reason is two-fold: to confirm through precision study that the newly-observed particle exhibits the properties expected of a predicted Standard Model Higgs boson, and also to deepen our understanding of the phenomenon of electroweak symmetry breaking. I plan to undertake a programme of analysis into the physics of vector bosons produced in association with jets, and specifically to investigate vector boson fusion (VBF) processes at the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. This production mode of the Higgs is of particular interest as it offers unparalleled sensitivity for studying the nature of the Higgs boson at the invariant mass at which it has been observed. My research would begin with measurement of the as yet unobserved (but predicted by the Standard Model) production of W and Z bosons via these same vector boson fusion processes, then use this analysis both as validation of VBF theoretical calculations and as an opportunity to study and improve the phenomenological description of jets produced in association with vector bosons to begin to study the physics of rapidity gaps in vector boson plus jet events at the LHC with the ultimate aim of observing and measuring Higgs boson production in the VBF channel. Such observations would allow for measurement of both the Higgs boson couplings to the gauge-bosons and the tensor structure of the HVV vertex as a way to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking.",0,0
107,214611,Yes,Global future health: a multi-sited ethnography of an adaptive intervention,"The proposed research project is a multi-sited ethnography of an emergent global health intervention to improve nutrition in the first 1000 days of life. The intervention links growth during this 1000-day window to chronic and mental illness, human capital, food security, and ecosystem sustainability, positing early life nutrition as the key to meeting the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. The intervention draws numerous disciplines and geographic regions together in a holistic pursuit of a sustainable and healthy collective future. It then unfolds in different settings in diverse and localized ways. The research team will work with first 1000 days experts as well as study deployment sites in Bhutan, the Netherlands, Guatemala, USA and the Philippines. The innovative anthropological techniques of contrasting and co-laboring will allow us to both analyze the intervention and contribute to its further fine-tuning. Health experts currently recognize that there are social complexities within and differences between the sites involved, but tend to treat these as obstacles to overcome. The innovative force of our research is to consider the adaptive transformations of the intervention as a source of inspiration rather than a hindrance. Where experts currently prioritize the question of how to translate expert knowledge into interventions in the field, we will ask how lessons from the field might be translated back into expert knowledge and, where relevant, made available elsewhere. In the process we will enrich the anthropological repertoire, moving it beyond a choice between criticism or endorsement, turning living with/in difference into both a social ideal and a research style.",0,1

275,194742,No,Biopolus Aero Green - Feasibility Study,"The objective of the innovation project is to bring to market a high-yield, highly automated aeroponic plant cultivation system suitable for resource efficient, high quality vegetable and fruit production in a limited physical footprint. This core technology and the associated supporting services are expected to be enablers of the widespread appearance of urban farms. The system lessens agricultural land use. Moving production closer to the place of consumption enables reduction in transportation needs, emissions and food waste production. The aeroponic technology produces very high yields while using the fraction of water. The system has the following main economic benefits for the users: • year-round crop production • no weather-related crop failures • no use of pesticides, herbicides • use of 75-95 % less water than the same productive  technologies • greatly reduced food-miles • higher food security and safety • high yield in crop production User needs met by the system: demand for products with trustworthy proof of socially and environmentally responsible business practices, demand for chemical-free food products. Targeted users are those SMEs and farmers who produce indoor, and those restaurants and supermarkets where day-to-day fresh fruits and vegetables are important. Economic benefits and ecological impact are the main appeals of the technology. The feasibility assessment’s goal is to quantify these advantages which are major milestones toward successful commercialization. Phase 2 plans are a first demonstration facility and building out full capacity of manufacturing.

Particular attention will be devoted to the institutional variety of VC/PE investors in Europe. We will consider factors affecting both the demand for and the supply of VC/PE financing, at micro and macro level. In particular, we will  analyze how the effects of VC/PE financing on the economic performance of portfolio companies are moderated by i) the characteristics of the investor, ii) the characteristics of invested firms, and iii) the characteristics of the business and institutional environment in which firms operate. In addition, we will examine specific open issues that play a crucial role for the development of the VC/PE sector in Europe, namely: i) the design of a mix of multi-level policy schemes targeting seed and pre-seed capital; ii) exit mechanisms for VC/PE investors; and iii) the European integration of the VC/PE sector and the internationalization of VC/PE investors. The project will benefit from a unique combination of qualitative (survey analyses and case studies) and quantitative empirical methodologies. As to these latter, the project will build and use a micro&macro cross-country panel type dataset with a rather long longitudinal dimension and wide coverage of EU countries so as to overcome some of the key weaknesses of the extant empirical literature.

257,205723,No,Exploration and promotion of neurogenesis in the adult brain,"It is now well established that new neurons are added to certain regions of the adult brain. There is today considerable interest in the development of regenerative therapies based on modulating endogenous neurogenesis, but it is necessary to better understand these events to assess whether this is rational and realistic.  This application takes its initiation in two recent discoveries that we have made: that astrocytes in the mouse striatum give rise to new neurons after stroke or inhibition of Notch signaling (Magnusson et al., Science, 2014) and that neurogenesis is a continuous process in the human striatum throughout adulthood (Ernst et al., Cell, 2014). We propose to characterize the molecular regulation of neurogenesis from striatal astrocytes in detail, and compare these astrocytes with those in other regions to understand why striatal astrocytes are uniquely neurogenic and whether astrocytes in other parts of the brain can be induced to give rise to new neurons. We will, moreover, assess the role of integration of new neurons in the striatal circuitry by inducing neurogenesis in the striatum in adult mice by blocking Notch signaling or by inducing stroke and modulate the activity of the new neurons by optogenetics and chemogenetics. We will, furthermore, study whether striatal neurogenesis is altered in human neurological diseases by retrospective birth dating by measuring the integration of 14C from nuclear bomb tests. We will assess whether inducing striatal neurogenesis in corresponding mouse models of neurological diseases has therapeutic potential.  This project will elucidate the molecular regulation of neurogenesis from astrocytes and the neurogenic potential of astrocytes in different parts of the brain, reveal the role of new neurons in the striatum, answer whether striatal neurogenesis is altered in common neurological conditions in humans and reveal whether inducing striatal neurogenesis may have therapeutic potential.",0,0
657,32020,No,EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL TELEPORTS,"The European Educational Teleports Project (EETP) aims to upgrade European distance education for adult workers, through better coordination of resources. Teleports enable regional private and public training centres to offer telematics-based distance courses, counselling and technical services to company trainees and producers of course materials. EETP will link them in a network providing coordinated delivery to similar users in five countries. Smaller firms and companies with fast-evolving training needs, as well as local public development agencies, will be the main target groups.    Continuing education and training, being a strategic area for the economic development of EU industries, constitue also a powerful market - worth more of 30 billion ECU in the EU in 1994 - in which companies of every size and public administration invest at a continously faster pace to remain competitive in the global market. Information Technology's recent developments have demonstrated a growing impact on creating positive attitudes to technology-based and distance training. The rationale of the European Educational Teleports (EETP) Project is to be found on the idea of creating a Europe-wide market, overcoming the limits of the present approach to distance continuing education in Europe, such as poor transnational co-ordination, inadequate efforts to find homogeneous user populations; overemphasis on the technical side of services rather than on learning and economic effectiveness.  25 European Educational Institutions and company-based training providers in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Finland are to design, experiment and evaluate a common European ground for continuing education services via the establishment and validation of a European network of Educational Teleports. In the concept of the Project, an Education Teleport is a Virtual Service Provider in which different organizations cooperate (via telematics) to provide a broad range of telematics-based learning and technical services to Learners and to producers of learning material. The services provided will include information, counselling, training materials (based on an appropriate mix of media), learner support, monitoring, evaluation and certification. In addition the Teleports will supply customer organizations (including producers of educational material) with organizational and methodological consultancy, training of tutors, trainers and managers, access to training facilities and equipment, customization of training products and service, delivery of learning materials and learner support.  The European network proposed by EETP will establish an homogeneous group of users in each of the 5 countries with the co-operation of many relevant user training institutions, in three main areas: SMEs operating in strategic sectors, Local Public Administrations dealing with socio-economic development supported with European resources; the Corporate sector in areas undergoing rapid technological change with a consequent requirement for human resource mobility and retraining. Service providers and user organization will be engaged in a common work for: analyzing user needs, defining the system functions, creating course contents, distribuiting them and evaluating both learning and economic results. Courses will be validated at transnational and national level on issues such as technological innovation, internationally-minded public administration, safety and other themes specified through an indepth field analysis. The Teleports will use an appropriate mix of media and technologies to deliver their services to end-users. These will include digital (satellite) and analog TV (for video and data broadcasting), the World Wide Web, electronic conferencing and e-mail, databases of learning materials. All Teleports will be linked over the Internet and via ISDN-based videoconferencing.   The final experimentation of the Teleport will involve more than 30 training centres and at least 800 end-users in the participating countries. A User Panel will review and validate all work at every stage. An exploitation plan will be elaborated at the end of the Project to reach larger audiences homogeneous to those participating in the validation phase. To contribute to a total user frendly approach to the distance learning experience, all technological services used in the Project will be based on standards, commercial technologies and infrastructures which are widely available in the Partners respective countries.. No heavy investment in technologies will be needed.. The products and standards used within the Project will be subject to regular review during the life of the project.",0,0
483,90406,No,Coordinated Control of Patterning and Growth: Mechanisms of Transcriptional Regulation and Dynamics of Dpp Signaling in Flies,"Animals and their organs become patterned as they grow. One of the most intriguing and challenging questions in developmental biology today is how patterning and growth are coordinated in time and space. Dpp, a member of TGF-β superfamily, with its ability to regulate both processes, serves as a paradigm to answer this question. Our first aim focuses on the logic of transcriptional regulation by Smad proteins, the nuclear effectors of the TGF-β pathways. The Drosophila Smad proteins, Mad and Medea, lead to activation of some target genes while inhibiting others. The putative cofactors required for Dpp-dependent activation have not been identified thus far. Here, I will test the hypothesis that T-box containing proteins, Dorsocross 1, 2, and 3, fulfill this function. In the second part, I aim to monitor Dpp signaling dynamics in vivo. I will fuse Dpp responsive elements to cDNA constructs that encode highly unstable versions of GFP or RFP allowing us to detect small and transient fluctuations in Dpp response. These experiments aim to achieve a detailed spatio-temporal analysis of the dynamics of Dpp signaling in growing tissues. Such in vivo studies will allow putting forward or excluding certain models of how Dpp exerts its multiple functions.",0,0
491,98737,No,Investigating the neural mechanisms of feature-based and spatial attention in a network model of two coupled brain areas,"'Attention is the ability to focus the processing resources of the brain onto relevant sensory information. This cognitive ability allows us to perceive attended aspects of the environment with enormous precision without being overwhelmed by irrelevant information. Recordings from neurons in the cortex of monkeys performing attentional tasks have demonstrated attentional modulation of sensory neurons in attend-to-location and attend-to-feature tasks (“spatial” and “feature-based” attention). The neural activity in sensory areas is not only modulated by attentional top-down signals but also by sensory-driven bottom-up processes such as neural adaptation. Despite extensive research on these phenomena, an explanation of attention at the level of single neurons and neural networks has remained elusive. The goal of the proposed project is to integrate bottom-up and top-down processes in a computational model in order to progress in the mechanistic understanding of visual attention. We propose using a multidisciplinary approach, based on a tight interaction of modeling and experiment. Experimental data from direction selective neurons of the visual cortex, which have been recorded by our collaborators, will guide the development of a biophysical network model and the model will, in turn, facilitate the data analysis. The model will consist of two cortical areas, one devoted to the active maintenance of information (working memory circuit in prefrontal or parietal cortex) and the other one responsive to novel stimuli (visual cortex, endowed with adaptation mechanisms). We expect the model to clarify the contribution to attentional modulation of interactions within and across cortical areas. In particular, we aim to investigate (1) the underlying mechanisms of bottom-up and top-down processes, (2) the interaction of spatial and feature-based attention, and (3) the influence of attention on the oscillatory synchronization and variability of neuronal responses.'",0,0
751,107424,No,Full biomechanical characterization of the coronary atherosclerotic plaque: biomechanics meets imaging,"Myocardial infarction is responsible for nearly 40% of the mortality in the western world and is mainly triggered by rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries. Biomechanical parameters play a major role in the generation and rupture of vulnerable plaques. I was the first to show the relationship between shear stress – one of the biomechanical parameters - and plaque formation in human coronary arteries in vivo. This accomplishment was achieved by the development of a new 3D reconstruction technique for (human) coronary arteries in vivo. This reconstruction technique allowed assessment of shear stress by computational fluid dynamics and thereby opened new avenues for serial studies on the role of biomechanical parameters in cardiovascular disease. However, these reconstructions lack information on the vessel wall composition, which is essential for stress computations in the vessel wall. Recent developments in intravascular image technologies allow visualization of one or more of the different plaque components. Therefore, advances in image fusion are required to merge the different plaque components into one single 3D vulnerable plaque reconstruction. I will go beyond the state-of-the art in image based modeling by developing novel technology to 3D reconstruct coronary lumen and vessel wall, including plaque composition and assess biomechanical tissue properties allowing for full biomechanical characterization (shear stress and wall stress) of the coronary plaque. The developed technology will be applied to study 1) vulnerable plaque progression, destabilization and rupture, to improve identification of risk on myocardial infarction and 2) predicting treatment outcome of stent implantation by simulating stent deployment, thereby opening a whole new direction in cardiovascular research.",0,0

There are 255,000 farms in the EU bovine meat sector, yet no network focused solely on their needs has been established to date. Coordinated by Teagasc (IE), BovINE is built around the multi-actor approach to implement more intense cooperation between researchers, advisors, farmers and relevant actors to facilitate greater exchange and acceptance of co-created solutions. BovINE draws on the EU, national and regional connections of the 18 consortium members to appropriate networks, on the four related key themes of socio-economic resilience, animal health and welfare, production efficiency & quality and environmental sustainability. Using the multi-actor approach BovINE will (i) capture and share innovative ideas and methods from practice across Europe and (ii) identify and conserve research findings that have not yet been widely adopted, enhancing their potential for integration into practice by assessing feasibility at demonstration farms. BovINE’s strategic and targeted dissemination and communication actions are designed to raise awareness of the project’s innovation potential, and deliver engagement with farmers, their intermediaries and knowledge providers. Through driving effective cooperation between beef producers and researchers, and utilising trusted gatekeepers, BovINE will form a transnational ecosystem to stimulate knowledge exchange at international level to boost the economic viability and sustainability of the European beef-producing sector.",1,1
664,93180,No,Flexible Wood Supply Chain,"A number of studies indicate that the market demand for wood will lead to strong competition between the different wood industry branches. This is especially true in view of a globalised wood market, in which production is characterised by fast structural changes and concentration processes. Competition between different wood industries and the development towards large production units, as well as an often highly diversified forest owner structure, demands a flexible delivery of varying wood quantities and quality. This leads to high cost, which weakens the position of the European wood industry within a global market. In addition, hazardous environmental events, such as wind throws, forest fires or beetle attacks, have increased during the past years. There is strong evidence that hazardous environmental events will become even more frequent, leading to unforeseeable damage in forests and to excessive felling. Increased competition, natural risks and political and economical disturbances within a global market undermine the concept of a steady and predictable long term development of the forest sector. The challenge is to improve existing processes of the wood supply chain to the needs of wood industry under these changing conditions. In order to meet the market demands of an improved and flexible wood supply chain, novel logistic concepts must provide better information assessment on wood resources and enhance optimisation models. The proposed project would provide a better and faster response to the demands of the different wood industry branches, which will lead to an increase in value recovery.",0,0
553,89886,No,The endocrine control of histone acetylation in regulating gonadotropin gene expression,"The gonadotropin hormones regulate reproduction, showing dynamic fluctuations in their expression levels across the life cycle to determine reproductive potential. The principle determinant of their expression is the hypothalamic hormone, GnRH, which stimulates both their synthesis and secretion. Aberrant GnRH exposure can stimulate precocious puberty, and we have shown previously that GnRH is able to overcome prolonged periods of gonadotropin gene repression, through removing histone deacetylases (HDACs) from their promoters. While HDACs repress transcription through nucleosome compaction, active histone acetylation on the protruding N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4, both loosens the packaging of DNA and can serve as a signal for the binding of additional transcription factors. Research on the gonadotropins has revealed a number of transcription factors that activate both basal and GnRH-stimulated gene expression, but the role of the histone modifications has not been studied. The first aim of this study is to investigate which histone acetyl transferases (HATs) activate the gonadotropin gene promoters in response to GnRH treatment, whether they have any target specificity on the H3 and H4 tails, and how they are recruited. Histone acetylation is just one of the various covalent modifications which are required for activating transcription, although the regulation and interdependency of many of these modifications are not yet clear. We will therefore also study the requirement and consequence of the histone acetylation for other histone modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation at these gene loci. This is a novel aspect of GnRH signaling to the gonadotropin genes, that both provides a suitable model for understanding basic mechanisms of hormone-induced chromatin modifications, and also has implications for clinical relevance in the field of reproductive endocrinology.",0,0
65,74914,Yes,Integration of animal welfare in the food quality chain: from public concern to improved welfare and transparent quality,"The primary objective of the 'Food Quality and Safety' Priority is to improve the health and well-being of European citizens through ensuring a higher quality of food. In a 'fork to farm' approach it recognises that consumer perception of food quality is n ot only determined by overall nature and safety but also by the welfare status of the animal from which it was produced. Thus, animal welfare is part of an overall 'food quality concept'.Within WELFARE QUALITY, leading European groups with the most appropr iate specialist expertise are integrated to build on European research strengths and to realise important societal and policy objectives in this Priority Area. Our research program is designed to develop pan-European standards for on-farm welfare assessmen t and product information systems as well as practical strategies for improving animal welfare. - Considerable effort is focused on analysing and addressing perceptions and concerns of principal stakeholders and providing appropriate feedback.

308,102895,No,Mechanism of centrosome positioning in HeLa cells,"The Centrosome (CS) is an organelle located near the nucleus that constitutes the primary Microtubule Organization Center (MTOC) in animal cells. The distribution of the microtubule cytoskeleton is therefore determined by the localization of the CS. Localization of this organelle is important for many cellular processes: I) Cell shape and polarization[6], II) Cell migration and III) Cell cycle.  The processes underlying CS localization are mechanical, with two possible scenarios: I) Pushing forces may be generated at the tips of MTs growing from the centrosome against an object such an organelle, cell cortex or plasma membrane; II) Pulling forces may be generated by MTs that remain attach to the CS and their tips shrink against an object. Alternatively, force could be generated along the length or tip of MTs by motor proteins and may be transmitted to the CS. Both pushing and pulling forces have been demonstrated to play a role in different organisms, but how the net force on the CS is regulated in order to achieve proper positioning is still an important open question.  The aim of this project is to study CS positioning in HeLa cells. We will first determine if the dominant force involved in centrosome positioning is pushing or pulling and secondly, explore the different contributions of these forces. To achieve this goal, we will directly perturb the force balance on the CS by severing MTs with laser ablation.",0,0

837,100279,No,A conserved mechanism regulating shoot and root lateral organ placement,"'Plant architecture is largely determined by branching patterns in the shoot and root systems. Shoots of seed plants, such as the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, branch via lateral bud outgrowth, where branches are patterned along the stem at the base of a leaf. Roots branch laterally from an internal cell layer surrounded by differentiated tissues, at a distance from the root tip. Despite the differences in ontogeny and the divergent evolutionary origin of root and shoot lateral branches, both processes are controlled by the three redundantly-acting AP2-domain containing transcription factors PLETHORA3, 5 and 7 (PLT3,5,7). These proteins control phyllotaxis, the pattern of lateral organs in the shoot, and rhizotaxis, the spacing of lateral roots. Although the phytohormone auxin is known to be intimately involved in both phyllotaxis and rhizotaxis, the PLT3,5,7 module represents the first genetic element to be implicated in control of both processes. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to illuminate the genetic network surrounding PLT3,5,7 gene activity in both the shoot and root contexts. Early results suggest that auxin lies both upstream and downstream of PLT action, pointing to a positive feedback loop which could be at the heart of a pattern generating system. To investigate this network further, genes surrounding PLT action will be identified using genetic, bioinformatic and biochemical strategies. Physical and genetic interactions will place these genes in a genetic hierarchy. Dynamic expression of these genes in living shoots and roots will be monitored using real-time confocal microscopy, and changes in the network dynamics will be observed in plt mutants and in auxin manipulation experiments. The results from this project will illuminate the similarities and differences between these two PLT-bases patterning pathways and will be of interest to developmental, computational and evolutionary biologists alike.'",0,0

Disease control has been compromised by the withdrawal of key pesticides and disinfectants by the EU in recent years, such as the withdrawal of approval for formaldehyde as a disinfectant and carbendazim fungicide for Trichoderma control.  The Mushroom SME AGs want to know what their members must do to prevent and / or control outbreaks of Trichoderma and Virus.  Disease control must now be based on a sustainable integrated pest management system (IPM).  IPM focuses on combining (i) improved hygiene procedures (ii) knowledge of how individual diseases and pests spread within and between crops (epidemiology), (iii) improved diagnostics and (iv) optimum use of available products to control and reduce the incidence of disease.  This project aims to provide research-based solutions for the mushroom industry to deal with these two relatively new major diseases affecting production. Application of the solutions developed by this project to the European mushroom industry will reduce crop losses and increase efficiency and competitiveness.  During the project we will (1) generate technical research-based information on how Trichoderma and MVX grow, survive and spread in mushroom compost in order to identify the weak links in the chain and the steps needed to strengthen them; (2) screen and evaluate alternative disinfectant and biocontrol products for use in disease prevention and control programmes; (3) identify, characterise and quantify the presence of pathogens on mushroom farms and compost facilities across Europe over a period of up to 12 months, using the most up to date technologies; (4) work towards identifying diagnostics service provider(s) who will offer new diagnostic tests, developed during the project, to SME AG members; (5) compile key results into Technical Factsheets for SME AGs to distribute to their members and (6) hold seminars, workshops and conferences organised by SME AGs for their members.  In the region of 300\ SME mushroom growers and composters  will benefit from the results and this will lead to reduced disease incidence and associated costs savings among a large group of SMEs.",1,1
3,201552,Yes,Organic food quality control and metabolomic fingerprinting,"In the last decade, the production and consumption of organic food has increased dramatically worldwide. The EU organic food market generates a turnover of more than 22 billion € with a total of approximately 11 million ha and 250,000 farms (2013). However, based on the literature reviewed, neither internal supply nor the legislative framework has kept up with this market expansion, been necessary a further harmonisation of methodology in data collection. On the other hand, the lack of reliable markers for the discrimination between organic and conventional products makes this market susceptible to attempted fraud. The Commission Regulation in a recent report (No 889/2008) highlights the need for greater cooperation between industry, Government, enforcement agencies, consumer groups and organisations.   In this context, the project proposes to confirm the utility of the new state-of-the-art techniques in mass spectrometry analysis (IRMS and HRMS), in combination with MSA, to improve information (qualitative/quantitative) in both food control safety and quality and their application to organic products. It will offer analytical approaches to (i) obtain wide-ranging information about contaminants, (ii) determine natural components and (iii) establish (dis)similarities between products. The “ORGANIC QUAL TRACERS” project comes in response to the key requirement for solving the authentication challenges in the organic-food sector, especially in organic vegetables as they are the pioneering products in Europe. The proposal offers a contribution to the objectives set out in the Horizon 2020 Strategy (“A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth”).",1,1

Cell-based assays screenings are the key tool used to assess the potential efficacy of a new compound in drug discovery, as it provides a simple, fast, and cost-effective approach to avoid large-scale and cost-intensive animal testing at early stages. Therefore, the development of in vitro cell-based systems that can more realistically mimic the in vivo cell behaviours is a raising market, with a CAGR2013-2018 of 12.4% growth rate and quantified in $21.6 billion by 2018. Drug research cell-based assays are mostly conducted with cell cultures on flat surface (2D), but they differ from human tissues significantly and can respond aberrantly to stimuli, resulting in missed discoveries and late-stage clinical failures of drugs in development. In contrast, 3D cell systems have a greater predictable power as they can better mimic the physiological environment in organs and tissues. Still, 2D cell culture systems offer advantages like the simplicity of handling and high data reproducibility that are not found in the current 3D cell systems. The last ones are very difficult to handle and not ready-to-use ones, giving poor consistency, data reproducibility and poor workflow integration. In response, we have developed 3DProSeed, the first ready-to-use solutions in the 3D cell culture market. Based on a patented novel process for manufacturing and encapsulating the cell growth matrix, known as hydrogel, inside 96-microtiter plates, we will be able to launch to the market the first ready-to-use, pre-assembled, hydrogel-based consumable products for pre-clinical screening development.

646,38557,No,Protection of reperfused myocardium against lethal mechanical injury,"This project aims at causal analysis and development of a therapeutic strategy for acute reperfusion injury. The first aim is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for mechanical cellular injury. The second aim is to develop a therapeutic strategy to limit this Injury.  Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in Europe. The extent of myocardial necrosis caused by acute coronary occlusion depends on damage developed during ischemia and during reperfusion, following spontaneous or therapeutic recanalization. There is increasing evidence that during the acute phase of reperfusion severe cellular damage, additional to the one manifested during ischemia, develops due to mechanical causes.  The project will combine methods and skills of three different laboratories within the European Union, two of which were partners in a previous, successful BIOMED-I project, to attain its objectives. The workplan considers the following 6 intermediate targets:  1. Sarcolemmal fragility is increased in reoxygenated cardiomyocytes. The importance of lipid peroxidation and disruption of the cytoskeletal anchoring of the sarcolemma will be investigated. 2. The role of uncontrolled force generation in reoxygenated cardiomyocytes, caused by elevated cytosolic Ca2\ levels, will be analyzed. 3. The causes for increased susceptibility of the myofibrils to develop hypercontracture will be studied in reoxygenated cardiomyocytes. 4. based on the previous causal analysis a composite strategy of therapeutic means will be developed for ischemic-reperfused myocardium in vivo (pig model). 5. In cardiomyocytes, saved from mechanical injury during early reperfusion, the consequences of gene expression in long-term recovery will be studied. 6. It will be investigated whether prevention of early reperfusion injury may eventually find its natural limit by nuclear injury, analogues to the natural process of apoptosis.  It is hoped that the answers to these questions will lead to the development of treatments able to improve survival and quality of life of patients with ischemic heart disease.",0,0
124,187796,Yes,"Social determinants and ecological impacts of seed transmission systems in African root and tuber crops, and their implications for resilience of smallholder farming systems","Understanding the processes by which smallholder farmers in developing countries increase or renew crop diversity, and how they maintain this diversity by ensuring the transmission of their technical and ecological knowledge through the generations, is essential for tackling food insecurity whilst at the same time conserving agricultural biodiversity. The KINSEED project focuses on seed transmission systems as a determining factor of the adaptive capacity of smallholder farming societies in a context of global changes, in particular climate change. Seed transmission systems are defined as the set of social norms and rules that govern the generational transmission of ‘seeds’ (here understood in the sense of propagules i.e., any material―true seeds, tubers, rhizomes, or stem cuttings―that are used for propagating crop varieties). The project will investigate the link between kinship systems and seed transmission systems and their role in structuring crop diversity and accessibility at local and regional levels. Because of its social dimension and intricate relation with traditional economic systems, seed transmission is an essential component of social-ecological systems yet it has seldom been studied, particularly in the context of resilience. The aims of this project are threefold: 1) To examine the relationship between seed exchanges and marriage exchanges and analyse the effects of seed transmission on the dynamics of crop diversity at local and regional levels; 2) To investigate the social and biological implications of global changes for smallholder farming societies and examine whether seed transmission systems may provide an opportunity for capacity-building or act as a social barrier to adaptation actions aiming at enhancing smallholder farming systems’ resilience to climate change; 3) To identify and propose improved pathways for capacity building through a better integration of formal (i.e., regulated by the public sector) and informal (local) seed systems.",1,1
683,210,No,Production and use of galacturonic acid as a building block for chemistry,"The main aims of the programme are as follows:  The design and operation of a pilot plant capable of producing galacturonic acid and salts.  The promotion of galacturonic acid as a versatile intermediate for the production of food and industrial additives.  Evaluation of galacturonic acid, galactonic acid and galactaric acid as calcium sequestrating agents in detergent and in metal surface treatment.  Evaluation of sweeteners and metabolism of L-galactose as a low calorie sweetener.  Preparation and evaluation of derivatives of galacturonic acid, galactonic acid and L-galactonolactone in the food and feed additives (eg in acidulents, wetting agents and emulsifying agents). A versatile intermediate for the production of food and industrial additives.  Price control and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels has led the modern industrial and agricultural sectors to investigate the use of biological renewable raw materials as a potential alternative. The coupling ofion exchange chromatography and electrodialysis has enabled the production of cheap yields of D-galacturonic acid.  Price control and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels has led the modern industrial and agricultural sectors to investigate the use of biological renewable raw materials as a potential alternative. A nitric oxidation process of D-galacturonic acid into galactaric acid has been developed. The constraints of a recycling process for nitrogen oxide vapors will not harm the economy of the process. Kilogramme yields of this acid are now available for validation tests in washing powder formulations, surface detergents and as food additives.  Price control and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels has led the modern industrial and agricultural sectors to investigate the use of biological renewable raw materials as a potential alternative. The complexing power of sodium galactarate, measured by specific calcium electrodes, has proved to be excellent when operating in synergy with boric acid, which is the bleaching agent usually used in washing powder formulations. The precipitation inhibition of calcium carbonate is slowed down by the addition of sodium galactarate. When evaluated in a real detergency test, without synergy with borates, it behaves in moderately hard water at least as well as sodium tripolyphosphate with which it is being compared.  Price control and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels has led the modern industrial and agricultural sectors to investigate the use of biological renewable raw materials as a potential alternative. Using gross hydrolysates and mixtures of anionic column regeneration, the optimum electrodialysis membranes have been selected and the protocol best adapted to problems of D- galacturonic acid purification has been defined.  Price control and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels has led the modern industrial and agricultural sectors to investigate the use of biological renewable raw materials as a potential alternative. In order to obtain a tensioactive product being able to claim the eco product label D-galacturonic acid fatty esters are being developed through enzymatic channels. A screening of various lipases has shown the feasibility of this process with future optimization involving Candida cylindracea and Aspergillus niger lipases.  Price control and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels has led the modern industrial and agricultural sectors to investigate the use of biological renewable raw materials as a potential alternative. Sterile confines and enclosures, and the metabolism cages necessary for the evaluation of L-galactose digestion have been developed. This will allow confirmation of the nonassimilation of this sugar. Surprisingly, only limited efforts have been devoted to the preparation and use of galacturonic acid as a chemical intermediate despite its natural abundance (galacturonic acid is the major constituent of pectins which are present in significant proportion in sugar beet pulps, apples and citrus pulps) and its versatility as a chemical building block.   A comprehensive review of the scientific literature concerning galacturonic acid clearly shows that this product or its derivatives have remained laboratory curiosities and have never reached the pilot plant development level. Galacturonic, galatonic and galactic acids are known as good sequestrating agents {complexity of various anions such as Ca(2\), Mg(2\), Fe(3\)}. In addition the use of galacturonic salts and derivatives in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food additives was proposed in the 1960's and 1970's.   Unfortunately none reached the industrial development level probably due to the absence of a technique allowing the recovery of galacturonic acid at low prices and thus permitting competition with other hydroxylated carboxylic acids such as fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric and gluconic acids. Galacturonic acid obtained by hydrolysis of crude or purified pectins remained too expensive for most of the envisaged application possibilities until a process allowing an enzymatic recovery of galacturonic acid was developed. This process is based on the enzymatic liquefaction of root crops such as sugar beet and chicory. The enzymes mixtures used contain a wide range of glucanases capable of hydrolyzing the sugars (sucrose in sugar beet, inulin in chicory) as well as the cell walls constituting carbohydrates (pectins, hemicelluloses, cellulose) providing galacturonic acid which can be removed by ion exchange or by electrodialysis.",1,0

299,188088,No,Identifying Functional Proteins at DNA Breaks with Quantitative Proteomics in Primary Lymphocytes,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in our genome that are not repaired properly can lead to various developmental, immunological, and neurological disorders and are a major driver for genomic instability and tumorigenesis. The role of chromatin accessibility is of key importance to understand how the DNA/chromatin template senses and amplifies the DNA damage signal to properly repair the DNA in its native context. While all cells employ mechanisms for repairing DSBs, lymphocytes have uniquely adapted the same repair pathways for generating antibody diversity. During an immune response, B-lymphocytes undergo physiological DNA damage initiated by the activated-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in a DNA rearrangement reaction called immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) class-switch recombination (CSR). If AID-induced DNA breaks are not properly resolved, this B cell-specific DNA damage can lead to the formation of oncogenic chromosomal translocations; however, it is poorly understood how chromatin-associated factors coordinate this recombination reaction to suppress genomic instability. Here, I propose to use a novel approach combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and mouse genetics with state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics to identify and elucidate chromatin-bound proteins at DSBs. I will define the protein landscapes at DSBs in response to both γ-IR- and AID-induced DNA damage, based on our preliminary data, with unprecedented resolution and statistical confidence. I will perform detailed functional characterization of a subset of proteins using complementary approaches that investigate the repair of IR- and AID-induced DNA damage in lymphocytes.  These combined unbiased proteomic and focused cell-based studies will deepen our understanding of the role of chromatin in the DNA damage response and DSB repair and may provide relevant targets for rationale design of therapeutic strategies for cancer or immunodeficiency disease.",0,0

It is a complication of the eye that can affect anyone who has diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy causes damage to the blood vessels supplying the retina – the “seeing” part of the eye. Because retinopathy generally has no obvious symptoms until it is advanced, early detection is essential. Detection is made by retinal screening. This is a straightforward procedure which includes assessment of visual acuity and eye fundus photography. Then a medical specialist, who looks for signs of diabetic retinopathy, gives a grade allowing a further diagnosis. This makes the diagnosis heavily dependent on the image quality. iPRI, which current activity is based on consulting expertise in public health, has identified a need for delivering a practical solution to the DR diagnosis challenge. iPRI has created a new prototype of software to enhance the quality of colour eye fundus exams. Several tests on representative databases have shown to DR experts that there is an important medical interest to introduce this service in the diagnostic procedure. IPRI’s international network of Key Opinion Leaders in Diabetes has confirmed this interest. Through the EYE-LIGHT project, iPRI aims to integrate this proven technology into a medical device. It will be provided as a professional application software service in order to facilitate the DR diagnosis, improve the image quality, allow comparisons and make images sharable through telemedicine.

1054,200375,No,"Innovative, easily applicable vaccine for poultry industry against five Salmonella serovars: Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Hadar, Virchow  and Infantis – SAL ETHVI","Salmonella species (also called serovars) are important zoonotic pathogens that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals. Poultry products contaminated with these pathogens are one of the major sources of human Salmonella infections worldwide. Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium are the serovars most frequently associated with human food poisoning (78.3 % of all cases in 2003). The serovars of Salmonella having places three to five are Virchow, Infantis and Hadar. Vaccination of chickens, along with other intervention measures in the overall biosecurity system of chicken farms, is an important strategy that is currently being used to reduce the levels of Salmonella in poultry flocks, which will ultimately lead to lower rates of human infections. However, despite numerous studies that have been performed, there is still a need for safer, well-defined Salmonella vaccines. At Immunolab we invented SAL ETHVI – innovative vaccine against above listed 5 serovars of Salmonella. We also breakthrough the technology for the vaccine production in a way that allows any configuration of serotypes, therefore if there is a need for a vaccine against another serovar, its production will be very easy. The end users of the vaccine will be poultry breeders, namely hens and broilers flocks owners. The unique features of our vaccine constituting our competitive adventage comprise : (1) easy application ; (2) low price ; (3) immediate vaccination upon hatching; (4) no risk of bacteria activation and spreading.

22,6052,Yes,POD SHATTER IN RAPE,"It is the purpose of this project to develop the technology required to engineering shatter resistance into oilseed rape using the tools of molecular biology. Transgenic oilseed rape with a reduced tendency to shatter may be prepared for exam-ple by offsetting the initiation of pod opening relative to the maturation of the seeds. In other words, all maturation and senescence processes may be allowed to proceed as in normal plants, only the timely coordination between seed dehydration and pod open-ing is severed and pod opening is delayed relative to seed maturation.   Two physiologically distinct approaches towards obtaining a selective delay of pod opening relative to seed maturation are being investigated:   - interference with the enzymes that bring about the physical separation of the carpels  - interference with the hormonal regulation of the pod opening process in broader terms.   These strategies are linked in theory by the fact that the enzymes studied in the first strategy are subject to the over-all regulation of the process as studied in strategy two. In practice, when it comes to engineering the traits, they become much more interdependent. In a move to ensure exploitation of the results Plant Genetic Systems was made a partner of the project (originally there were no industrial partners in this project). Plant Genetic Systems stepped into the current AlR-project for a number of reasons, the most pertinent being a pressing need to submit a patent-application in order to ascertain the economical viability of the applied aspects of the project. This has now happened with a patent that amply reflects the broadening of the project as it developed during the first two years.   Conclusion   So far a solid foundation for two main approached aimed at engineering shatter resistance has been established. A rape transformation procedure is in place, and the first generation of are being developed. Pod shatter denotes the opening of oilseed rape silques and dispersal of the seeds as they mature. Flowering and seed shatter is not synchronous in rape; hence there is no such thing as the 'correct harvest time'. Immature seeds contain more moisture and more chlorophyll both of which lead to reduced oil quality. Late harvest dates leading to less immature seeds is often accompanied by loss of yield and problems with fighting run-away rape with chemical herbicides in the following year. Swathing reduces the risk that wind bring about excessive shattering of seeds from the most mature pods while allowing the younger ones to catch up to some extent. Timing of swathing is very critical and it is not always that yields are greater than the potential yield from a crop harvested by direct combining.   Activities   These include an examination of the roles of endo-polygalacturonase in dissolution of load bearing structures holding the carpels together and a detailed examination of the roles of auxins and ethylene and its precursor on the initia-tion or stimulation of pod opening. Such studies have enabled the possibility of breeding greater shatter resistance in transgenic plants, based on key elements of the pod opening process, based on interference with pod opening.   Strategies   Both main strategies, indicated above, aim to interfere with developmental events in the so-called dehiscence zone, a few layers of thin walled cells along the edges of the two valves of the pod. The cells in this zone eventually separate and allow the pod to open. It is possible to interfere in either late, or early events. Interference may be directly with a processes directly, or be in regulation. In either case the objective is to override develop-mental events in the dehiscence zone. Rape transformation is essential for all strategies. Hence, a rational and efficient transformation procedure, using spectomycin resistance as the selectable marker, has been developed.   Polysaccharide hydrolase-antisense approach  Anatomical studies have shown that the middle lamella between the dehiscence zone cells eventually dissolves while the primary cell walls of the same tissue softens and looses wall material. Biochemical studies have demonstrated the presence or accumu-lation late in development of a range of enzymes that may play a role in the weakening of the tissue so that the pods eventually open. Among these , most research efforts have been applied to endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG) which is believed to take part in depolymerization of the middle lamella. One endo-PG, among the several that occur in rape has been cloned. It has been found that this isoform is expressed in the dehiscence zone immediately preceding and during pod opening. An antisense strategy, that entails production of transgenic rape plants in which the expression this enzyme is suppressed selectively, has been adopted so that only pod opening and not other processes that depend on related genes are disturbed. The gene in hand will be used to make the first generation of transgenic plants and thus establish the feasibility of the polysaccharide-antisense approach.   Hormonal regulation approach Investigations of endogenous hormones in various pod tissues in combination with applications of synthetic growth regulators have produced a very interesting picture. Evidence have been produced that the dehiscence zone remains intact as long as the auxin concentration in the dehiscence zone cells is at a sustained high level. The use of par-thenocarpic pods (pods that have been induced to develop without seeds inside), has shown that the seeds is indeed the main source of the auxin influencing the dehiscence zone cells. Dur-ing dehydration auxin transport ceases from the seeds and the dehiscence zone cells respond accordingly. One of the responses may well be that the tissue becomes receptive to ethylene, an accelerator of maturation arid senescence processes. The strategy depends on equipping the dehiscence zone cells with their own auxin bio-synthetic machinery, so that they become independent of seeds as source of auxin, and hence will not acquire sensitivity to ethylene. Removal of the ability to respond to ethylene is expected to delay pod opening.",1,1

768,224866,No,Unlocking the potential of thermo-sensitive bioactive ingredients through a disruptive encapsulation method,"Functional foods provide additional health benefits beyond its nutritional value by adding certain bioactive ingredients to its basic formulation, like Omega-3, probiotics or vitamins. They are massively consumed, being a long-lasting megatrend in food industry, started in the 80’s, and currently living its best moment. Their generated revenue will grow by 50 % until 2022. 1 out of 4 new food products launched have a functional claim. So, global food industries are eager to increase their functional food products portfolio due to its high consumers’ acceptance, potential for deploying new markets, and higher added value. However, most of these bioactive ingredients are easily vulnerable (prone to oxidation, thermolabile…), so, there is a challenge in assuring their integrity and bioavailability when introducing them in food products (complex matrix!). To protect them they are usually encapsulated. Most encapsulation methods work at high temperature damaging the ingredients. Moreover, most methods are energy-intensive, and entail high production costs. In Bioinicia we are experts in nanoencapsulation, and we have developed CAPSULTEK: an innovative own-developed technology called Electrospraying Assisted by Pressurized Gas of which we have a 1 t/year prototype. With our technology we can work at room temperature, encapsulate any kind of molecule, enhance its stability and extend its shelf-life. Besides, industrially-wise, we can scale it up to reach industrial volumes, to reduce encapsulation costs by 40% and to increase concentration bioactive ingredients by 50%. We need Ph.2 to reach market readiness. We will build an industrial demo plant of 10 tonnes/year and will optimize the processing parameters for Omega-3 and probiotics. We have designed a bold and effective highly scalable business model to make the most of CAPSULTEK.  First-line food companies have already stated their interest on it, and we foresee an 8 M€ profit by the fifth year of its commercialization.",0,0
383,105877,No,Propagative and Internal Coherence in Semiconductor Nanostructures,"'This project concerns the field of coherent, nonlinear, ultrafast light-matter interaction on a quantum level in solids. It proposes to experimentally explore limits of: i) internal coherence of an individual emitter; ii) radiative coupling between pairs of emitters. A potential long term application of this work could be envisaged, as one can expect that individual emitters could serve as qubits for implementations of optically controlled quantum information processing in solids. As individual emitters we will employ excitons in semiconductors: either bound to impurities or confined in quantum dots. Firstly, by embedding the latter into upright photonic nanowires, that are now available in the team, we will amplify the collection of their coherent optical response by nearly four orders of magnitude as compared to the current state-of-art. This will provide an unprecedented access to their coherent as well as dephasing interaction with phonons. It will also enable retrieval of their n-wave mixing responses to scrutinize coherent couplings within an individual emitter. The second objective is the demonstration of an efficient, controllable and non-local coherent coupling mechanism between distant emitters, which is a prerequisite for the construction of quantum logic gates and networks. Here, such a radiative coupling will be demonstrated and manipulated using resonant emitters embedded into in-plane one-dimensional waveguides, which permit virtually unattenuated propagation of coherence. The internal and propagative coherence of individuals and radiatively coupled pairs will be explored using beyond-the-state-of-the-art methods of coherent nonlinear spectroscopy. Specifically, we will develop a spatially-resolved heterodyne spectral interferometry combined with ultrafast pulse-shaping. The proposed advanced methodology of this ERC project can be associated with techniques developed in other domains, like nuclear magnetic resonance and astrophysics instrumentation.'",0,0
935,204817,No,Success in Public Governance: Assessing and explaining how public problems are sometimes addressed remarkably effectively,"Societies cannot survive and thrive if they are not governed well. The public’s business – e.g. security and safety; health and well-being – needs to be managed effectively. Achieving this in the current era of connectivity, transparency, accountability and assertive, skeptical and empowered citizens deeply challenges the institutions of government, which were largely designed for a drastically different era. We urgently need to learn how we can govern societies successfully under the new circumstances.  However, in both the popular and academic discourse, the focus is on the frailty and fallibility of our government institutions. We excel in explaining how policies fail, reforms falter, public money is wasted, public leaders are distrusted, and public institutions eroded. So much so that robust knowledge about the practices that produce good governance is hard to come by. And yet good governance is all around us, allowing us to learn from successes as well.  This proposal seeks to address the imbalance. It offers a constructive, yet rigorous and systematic investigation of ‘success’ in 21st century governance. An innovative combination of theoretical perspectives, comparative approaches, and mixed methods is developed to answer five questions:  1. How is success in public governance defined and assessed by those who engage in it and those who experience it? 2. Why are some public policies enduringly successful?  3. Why are some public organizations enduringly successful? 4. Why are some interactive, collaborative governance initiatives enduringly successful? 5. How do these successful examples jointly contribute towards understanding the principles of a theory for governance success?  The inquiry will increase our insight into the pivotal yet ill-understood phenomenon of governance that ‘works’. It will enrich the field with new methodologies, provoking the discipline to reconsider the emphasis on failure and undertake the systematic study of success.",0,0

The special interest in this study arises from the fact that Bi-2212 is a candidate for the unconventional d-wave pairing state through a coupling mechanism different from the usual BCS concept. The proposed experiment implies the fabrication of Josephson tunnel junctions. In a first step we will prepare epitaxial films and pattern them into microbridges along well defined crystallographic axes. Tunnel junctions along the different directions will be produced either by narrowing the microbridges to nanobridges or by the deposition of a ferromagnetic layer across the microbridges. In order to study the anisotropy of the energy gap A(k,T), current-voltage characteristics will be measured, since the critical current is related to A(T). The assumption of a d-wave state predicts the vanishing of A for specific crystallographic directions.",0,0
77,72252,Yes,Ensuring the quality of innovative crop growth inputs derived from biological raw materials (biological food for plants) - (BFPs),"The global objective of the Project is to increase the quality, reliability, safety, and end-user acceptance of environmentally benign crop growth inputs (Biological Food for Plants -BFPs) for intensive horticulture, thus contributing to the common agricul tural reform policy that promotes quality products and sustainable agriculture. BFPs are innovative soil or plant amendments derived from biological resources that contain one or more biologically active compounds that reinforce crop vigour. BFPs reduce th e need to employ mineral fertilisers, and also improve crop health, plant disease resistance, and soil micro-life, thus decreasing the dependency on chemical crop protection agents. Among organic and conventional crop producers, an urgent need exists to ac cess environmentally benign, safe, and effective inputs, and consumers also increasingly demand 'green' agricultural products with guaranteed quality and safety, and good traceability. The Project initiates integrated actions to meet the abovementioned ne eds and provide the required guarantees. First, the manufacturing processes ofBFPs (such as leather hydrolysis, natural extraction of seaweed and herbs, and chemical extraction of pine needles) are reviewed and, for each process, a quality management syste m is developed according to IS0-9001 guidelines. Quality management systems will be developed to permit systematic reduction of waste, to increase production efficiencies, and to ensure safe and homogenous BFP products of known consistency. These efforts c ontribute to one of the objectives of the EC, i. e. product transparency and traceability. Second, scientific research is carried out on BFP products for their exact chemical and biological composition (including pathogens and heavy metal content) and thei r effect on plant growth, plant health, and soil micro-life. Also a scientific assessment is made of the impact of BFPs on soil and groundwater. Furthermore, scientific research is carried out on the quality of the vegetables and fruits produced with and without BFPs. Possible pathogen loads and chemical contaminants are measured, as well as.. positive quality indicators such as storability, vitamin content, fIrmness, etc. The scientific results thus obtained are essential for the SMEs to obtain legislativ e permission to export their BFPs to other European countries. At present, no proper pan-European regulation (similar to the EC label) exists for BFPs or for comparable products, which seriously hinders international trade. By demonstrating that BFPs are indeed effective, safe, and environmentally benign, regulatory recognition of BFPs and thus their international marketing becomes realisable. For increased end-user acceptance, the practical end-use value of BFPs is tested in the Project under contrasting production situations, with important temperate and Mediterranean vegetables and fruits as reference crops. All information with either practical or scientific value will be transferred to the public during the lifetime of the Project through open days, de monstration days, press releases, etc. Research methods will be documented and, if possible, published for future use in efforts to obtain consistent regulations on BFPs throughout the EU.",1,1
544,51127,No,Evolution and growth in networks of technology-based small and medium- sized enterprises (SMES) and large firms,"RESEARCH OB JECTIVES physiological traits and diseases. In contrast to its central role in physiology, biochemistry, toxicology, transplantation research, cancer research, neurobiology and other fields, the rat has lagged behind the mouse as a genetic model organism. Molecular biology has catalysed the convergence of physiology and genetics, and consequently there is an increasing need for genetic studies in the rat. In the past few years there has been very significant progress in rat genome analysis. While almost no reliable gene assignment was available in the early 80'es, some 600 rat genes have now been assigned to specific chromosomes, and a genetic map with some 650 markers is also available. Teams participating in the present project have been intimately involved in this development, contributing about half of the chromosome assignments and also to the construction of the linkage maps. Furthermore, the participating teams have developed the only existing international rat genetic database (RATMAP). Thus European teams have a strong tradition in rat gene mapping, and our proposal is to generate mapping resources and information necessary to take advantage of the rat for the identification of genes underlying traits relevant to mammalian physiology, behaviour and complex disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, susceptibility to cancer or stress, drug addiction etc. The genetic basis of such traits could be understood if the rat genome was better known. The proposed project contains two parts: mapping the rat genome on the one hand and analysis of multifactorial traits on the other. The mapping work will include: - genetic linkage work of transcribed genes,especially 'anchored reference loci' for comparative mapping, and of anonymous markers, using molecular methods that have already been implemented in the participating labs, and with rat strains and strain crosses already available, generation of new markers (e.g. AFLP, RAPD) - chromosome and cytogenetic mapping of genes using cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), including orientation of the linkage groups with respect to the chromosomes and amalgamation of the genetic linkage and the cytogenetic maps - isolation of whole genome radiation hybrids to generate a high resolution map of active genes, even if they are devoid of genetic polymorphism - construction of new genomic DNA libraries - ensuring availability of the generated data as well as those linkage data disseminated in the literature to the scientific community via expansion of the already implemented rat genome database and the rat encyclopedia which is being implemented. The analysis of multifactorial traits will deal with cancer, neurological and psychiatric disorders, autoimmune diseases and the dissection of the rat MHC, metabolic studies, hypertension and morphogenesis. This work will be greatly facilitated by the collaborations established within the proposed project, and by the flow of new information among the groups.",0,0

797,83926,No,The development and function of secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues,"Adaptive immune responses are initiated in large and highly organized clusters of lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, the secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues (LTs). The development of secondary LTs, i.e. lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, is programmed and initiated in the sterile environment of the fetus. A cascade of events is triggered by lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, which recapitulates the inflammatory reaction and culminates in the formation of complex structures carrying specialized he matopoietic and stromal cells. The formation of tertiary LTs follows a similar pathway, but is induced after birth by commensal microbes, infection or injury. Chronic inflammation also leads to the spatial organization of the lesion and to tertiary LT formation, which may establish a positive feedback loop of lymphocyte activation.  The aim of our laboratory is to understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of LTs during fetal life, in response to commensals, during infection and injury, and during the inflammatory reaction. The long-term goal is to develop new and specific tools for the modulation of pathologic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis, or conversely, to induce the formation of LTs to enhance local immunity against infection or cancer.  The specific aims of this project are: 1. Understanding the fetal development of secondary LTs. 2. Understanding the post-natal formation and function of tertiary LTs. 3. Identifying lymphoid stromal cells initiating and supporting LT development. 4. Modulating pathologic inflammation through the control of LTs. 5. Inducing therapeutic LTs.",0,0
1029,82516,No,Emergent complexity in electronically frustrated correlated electron systems,"The correlation of electrons in a solid produces a variety of states, typically through the interplay between magnetism and electrical conductance. That interplay has itself been a long-standing research topic among condensed matter physicists. But since the discovery of high-temperature superconductors, a more general interest in the Mott transition, the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a correlated-electron system, has emerged. Close to the MIT, competition between distinct ground states gives rise to spatially extended slow density fluctuations, and coexistence of different ordered phases separated by one or more quantum critical points. Furthermore, the charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom, and their coupled dynamics, produce complex phases such as liquid-like, crystal-like, and liquid-crystal-like states of electrons. The behaviours of these systems present profound challenges in fundamental physics, and electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications because in addition to spin and charge, the lattice and orbital degrees of freedoms are active, leading to large responses to small perturbations. This project will study the nature of quantum order at low temperatures in materials on the border of magnetism and close to a disorder-driven MIT. We will use charge carrier doping as a quantum tuning parameter to investigate the formation of spatially extended density fluctuations and demonstrate the implications of electronic complexity in low dimensional systems. We aim at identifying a physical picture describing the dynamics of spin and charge in materials near disorder-driven MIT's and study the most dramatic consequence of all: the possibility of extended and slow density fluctuations acting in favour of superconducting pairing.",0,0
502,61099,No,Micro Acoustic Sensor System for CO2 Tracking,"Indoor air quality is a major concern both in terms of human health aspects and efficient use of energy resources. Tracking of CO2 levels with sensitive, low-cost sensors will open up numerous new applications such as demand-control ventilation and monitoring instruments. Respiratory health care is a second area where CO2 sensors are key elements. The objective of this project is the development of a demonstrator CO2 sensor microsystem and to prove that silicon MEMS technology is feasible for the realization of a range of sensor microsystems with adequate performance at a very low production cost. The project will result in a demonstration of the technology in addition to the definition of a mass-producible product aimed at the main application area. Key partners for the industrialization phase and potential users will be identified.  Objectives: The main objective of our concerted project is to demonstrate that silicon MEMS technology is feasible for the realisation of a range of sensors and microsystems for indoor air quality control, respiratory health care and related applications, and that specified performance may be obtained at very low production cost.  The feasibility demonstration will be a two-year process including the following stages: Specification, partitioning, interfacing, modelling, simulation, MEMS implementation, electronic design, prototyping, characterisation, and technology implementation.  The consortium consists of three partners with complimentary skills and capabilities. One industrial partner is in possession of adequate MEMS fabrication technology, and experience of high volume production. A second industrial partner brings an innovative solution to the assigned problem area. A third partner brings expertise, R&D skills and capacity to the project.  Work description: The project is divided into six major workpackages with active involvement and interaction of the three partner organizations and some additional support of subcontractors for realization of onboard electronic functionality through MPW services.  The workpackages are: - Specifications, partitioning, interfacing - Modelling, simulation and MEMS implementation - Prototyping - Electronic interface design and verification - Characterisation - Technology implementation. In addition, a seventh workpackage provides project management and coordination.  A key element here is that the partners have agreed to an early completion of a Consortium Agreement. Each workpackage has an identified responsible partner and is structured into separate tasks with clearly indicated milestones and deliverables. All three project partners have accumulated extensive experience from participation in international cooperative R&D projects, and have the necessary infrastructure in place; they can refer to previous success stories of completed projects which have required a great amount of concurrent development and engineering.

172,194752,Yes,Bringing a breakthrough e-nose solution on global markets for portable and reliable food safety and quality control,"Possibility for a reliable and effective food quality assessment at a consumer level would be of paramount importance both in industrialized and less developed countries as it will have tremendous implications in health (avoidance of food poisoning) and economic domains (avoidance of food waste). The issues of food poisoning and their consequences constitute a major social problem. According to the World Health Organization more than 200 diseases are spread through food. Furthermore, one person in three in industrialized countries may be affected by foodborne illness each year. The issue of proper assessment of food quality and whether it is still edible or already not is also of immense economic importance. According to the statistics of the European Commission, about 90 million tonnes of food is wasted annually in Europe.    Currently, there is no single, portable device available to consumers that would support them in ascertaining in a reliable way: a) whether a food product is fresh, b) whether it might be potentially hazardous to health, c) whether there is a risk of food poisoning, and d) whether it is still safe to be consumed.   Hence, the overall aim of this project is to provide a breakthrough solution to the above mentioned societal and economic challenges by delivering fully functional, market ready, unique and innovative at a world level electronic device (“electronic nose”) and mobile application to determine the quality and level of freshness of meat, poultry, fish and other grocery products.

154,48242,Yes,Exploring the potential of a sustainable crop as an alternative non-food source,"The objective of the present proposal is to evaluate a new crop (i'achyrhizus ahipa) as a potential altemative to other less environmentally friendly crops used at present as sources of proteins and carbohydrates. The novelty lies in the crop itself, which is an efficient N2-fixing legume, pest-resistant, and tolerant to drought conditions which makes this new crop ideal in a sustainable agricultural system. The objective will be fulfilled by studying the potential yield under different environmental conditions, the N2-fixation efficiency, tuber and seed protein and carbohydrate composition and quality, and seed oil content using different accessions and interspecific hybrids. The results will be compared with other high-input crops in which present production of raw materials is being based in order to offer a low cost altemative of carbohydrates/proteins. F the different tuber-forrning legumes, P. Ahipa is at present the only cultivated one which can be grown under European conditions. With its origin in Andean Valleys being formerly cultivated by the Inca civilization, it was thought to be extinct until it was found by botanical expeditions to the Andean region of Bolivia and Northem Argentina. Little is known of the detailed protein composition of the tubers, but recent studies of a related species, P. Erosus, have shown the presence of two major glycoproteins which together account for over 70% of the total soluble proteins. These proteins are closely related to each other and appear to belong to the papain class of cysteine proteinases. Im addition, a minor protein corresponding to only 2-3% of the soluble protein fraction was found to correspond to a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor. Another important product from P. Ahipa are the seeds which contain high protein concentration, oil, and compounds with insecticidal action (rotenone). Plant resistance to pests apparently come from its content in the amino acid L-canavanine and rotenone. Thus, a variety of products (proteins, starch, insectides) may become available by adopting a crop with several ecological and economical advantages such as reduced need for synthetic fertilizers and insecticides that would decrease the negative impact of such agricultural practices on the environrnent and improve the fragile farm economy by reducing input requirements. The proposal fully comply with the objectives of the work programme on identification and analysis of crops for non-food uses (4.3.2. Biomass production) by providing a research work on the possibilities of a new source of proteins, carbohydrates and oil. Additionally, the overall aims are consistent with EU policy on adopting sustainable agriculture systems for reducing the ecological impact of agriculture and reducing the production costs. The aim of the project is to study the potential of P. Ahipa for the production of proteins and carbohydrates, the characterisation of the products quality and yield, and an initial assessment (comparison) of the new crop with other traditional sources of proteins and carbohydrates. The effect of different environments, management practices (seed inoculation, flower pruning) on yield and product composition will be considered to have a full approach to the real potential value of the crop.",1,1
214,94768,No,Chiral Triamino Iminophosphorane Organocatalysts and their Reactions,"We wish to develop new families of chiral single enantiomer triamino iminophosphorane bases and exploit their high basicity in a series of new organocatalytic asymmetric methodologies for providing ready access to desirable chiral products with high enantio- and diastereocontrol from readily available starting materials. This would constitute a new, powerful and broadly applicable organocatalytic asymmetric strategy to such target molecules. The development of new readily accessible and modular designs for tunable single enantiomer triamino iminophosphorane bases will be carried out via two complementary routes that could allow the synthesis of focused libraries of tens of catalysts for screening in a range of important synthetic transformations. In the first, stereochemically pure azides are heated with phosphorous triamides, which upon release of nitrogen yields the target base in just one simple transformation. As azides can be readily prepared from parent enantiopure alcohols via Mitsunobu inversion or from amines through diazo transfer, the route benefits from a broad-based simple design which can allow much structural variation to the target triamino iminophosphorane bases. An alternate route would employ commercially available or readily prepared chiral ethylene diamines reacting with PCl5 followed by triple N-alkylation. The performance of these new highly basic chiral organocatalysts will then be assessed in a range of addition reactions of methylene and methine pronucleophiles to a range of low reactivity electrophiles. Furthermore, through molecular modelling we would like to elucidate the mechanistic pathway and origins of stereocontrol and finally apply the chemistry in the total asymmetric synthesis of the natural product (R,R)-elacomine. The work will therefore be multidisciplinary, involving the development of innovative catalytic asymmetric organic methods, computational chemistry and target synthesis.",0,0
515,16872,No,The nutritional requirements of broodstock sea bass and their effects on egg quality and larval survival and growth,"This project aims to provide information on the nutritional requirements and growth of sea bass broodstock and the effects of these parameters on the production and quality of the eggs at spawning and the growth and survival of the first-feeding and older fry. Different groups of pre-pubertal and previously matured broodstocks will be fed on natural and pelleted diets containing different protein-lipid ratios and different levels of specific and total essential fatty acids. Some experiments will also involve seasonal variations in dietary lipid level to coincide with different stages of ovarian development. Measurements of weight, length and specific growth in the different experimental groups, together with analyses of proximate carcass composition, plasma insulin, thyroid and steroid hormone levels and related metabolites and histological assessments of gonadal development and liver structure will provide information on the nutritional adequacy of the different diets. At spawning the quality and number of eggs produced and the growth, survival and incidence of developmental and behavioural abnormalities of all the larvae derived from the broodstock in the different feeding trials will be monitored. Collectively, these data should provide sufficient knowledge of sea bass nutrition and broodstock management to enable ready supplies of good quality eggs and fry to be made available to the developing industry. It should also help us to understand why sea bass show such poor (slow) growth under farming conditions.  Trial 1:  Broodstock sea bass were maintained on pellet diets containing 9% and 15% total lipid fed to satiation and at a reduced ration for 21 months. Fish maintained on the 15% lipid diet fed to satiation showed marginally improved growth during the first year and were significantly heavier and had a higher condition factor than those fed 7% lipid at reduced ration and control fish.   In the first spawning season, egg viability was greater among fish maintained on the 15% lipid diet fed at reduced ration and control fish. Spawnings from control fish also showed higher survivals to hatch and to first feeding. In the second spawning season, both egg viability and survival to hatch were higher in eggs produced by control females than those maintained on any of the pelleted diets. Females reared on the pelleted diets had declined to a state of near infertility.   Control females showed significantly higher levels of serum vitellogenin throughout the final maturation period preceding the first spawning season. Eggs collected from spawns in both seasons showed no significant differences in total lipid or lipid class composition between groups. Eggs spawned by control fish contained significantly more polyunsaturated fatty acids, an increased n-3 fraction and significantly higher amounts of 22:6n-3.   Trial 2:  Separate broodstocks received an artificial (pelleted) diet with a high essential fatty acid (EFA) content at different stages of their reproductive cycle, and a diet low in EFA at all other times. Control fish were reared on the high EFA diet throughout the trial. Fish in all groups have shown a similar pattern of growth with no consistent differences in specific growth rate or condition factor to date.   These broodstocks have completed 1 spawning season. Control fish and those received the high EFA diet during vitellogenesis and final maturation only showed significantly higher egg viabilities and survival to hatch than those receiving a high EFA diet during either spawning or recrudescence and previtellogenesis. This programme of research falls conveniently into three sections as follows:   The growth and nutritional requirements of broodstock sea bass  The effects of varying broodstock nutrition on the production, quality and composition of eggs and the growth and survival of larvae  The effects of dietary nutrient enrichment on larval growth and survival   The specific phases of the areas of research are listed below:   Formulation and fabrication of the diets  The nutritional trials and growth of the broodstock  Egg incubation, larval nutrition and survival  Analyses of proximate composition of eggs and broodstock  Histological studies  Measurements of plasma insulin, steroid and thyroid hormones, vitellogenin and other metabolites  Data processing.",1,0
913,99525,No,Learning from the locals: A metagenomic investigation into the plant biomass degrading capacity in Norwegian native herbivores,"'Understanding the enzymology of plant biomass conversion is a key issue in the world’s desire to establish a sustainable bio-based economy. Currently available enzyme technology is insufficiently effective, and several fundamental key questions as to how enzymes and plant cell walls interact remain. The present project will address these issues by studying a natural biomass-converting ecosystem adapted to the local biomass, namely the microbial community (microbiome) resident in the digestive tract of Svalbard reindeer.  The project aims to generate a metagenomic reconstruction of microbial community structure and its metabolism using a combination of deep 454 sequencing technology as well as functional and sequence-based screens. It will specifically target recovering genetic determinants encoding genes underpinning the deconstruction of plant structural polysaccharides. Relevant genes identified from the metagenome using bioinformatic and functional screens, will be cloned, over-expressed, and their gene products characterised in detail. In addition to creating fundamental insight into the microbial ecology and enzymology of plant biomass conversion, insight into the reindeer microbiome may also contribute to a better understanding of the health and well-being of this important Norwegian animal. This project will link the most prominent Norwegian research group on biomass enzymology (Prof. Vincent Eijsink, UMB) to one of the most prominent research groups in gut metagenomics (Prof. Morrison, CSIRO, Australia) and to a truly international network of (highly relevant) contacts and collaborations.

926,3727,No,To explore and improve the industrial uses of EC wheats,"The project is aimed at exploring and improving the industrial use of EC wheats (T. aestivum), with the objective of filling the growing gap between process development and its understanding in terms of processing requirements and thus wheat quality requirements. A further objective is the stimulation of breeding and development of wheats capable of satisfying the present and future demands of European industry and the export market.  A main aim of this project was to stimulate breeding and development of novel wheat varieties that combine good agronomic character and excellent technological qualities, and which would satisfy simultaneously farming, manufacturing industries and export markets. Attempts have been made to maximise EC grown wheat quality by providing tools to minimize sprout damage and maximise milling quality. The economy of EC wheats has been maximized by relating current processing requirements to wheat characteristics, thereby enabling traders, millers and breeders to select on these characters. New outlets for wheat have been opened by investigating and developing new applications of wheat and wheat products (flour, starch, gluten). Improved use will result from better knowledge of the various applications of wheat (milling, white and wholemeal breadmaking, gluten and starch industry, flour blends, fermented products and biscuit manufacture). Each main parameter of processing and its effect will be expressed in terms of functional properties of the wheat and related to specific wheat protein constituents and their interactions.   Combined functional, physicochemical and biological advanced methodologies will be applied to quality determinants, which will result in a better understanding of their variability of composition, structure, and of their mechanism of action in the various industrial processes. As a consequence of the availability of genetic stocks and wheat samples produced in highly controlled environments of the various EC countries, the identification of improved breeding criteria (for sprouting resistance, milling quality, breadmaking or biscuit making quality, adaptation to gluten and starch separation) and the development of rapid tests for use in breeding programmes and trade will be obtained.",1,0

This proposal by 5 European expert laboratories aims to assess the severity of infestation by the pathogen, as well as the effects of simple non-chemical practical methods taken against it. The project will first fine-tune available methods for the detection, identification and ecological monitoring of the brownrot bacterium. Partners will subsequently perform a European transect study aimed at investigating the prevalence as well as load of R. solanacearum in several European ecosystems. This study will provide information as to pathogen incidence, as well as generate strains which will serve as target organisms for subsequent ecological assessments of fate and persistence. Such strains will also be characterized for their aggressiveness versus a broad selection of potential host plants. In a third phase, the experiments will focus on the fate of R. solanacearum strains selected in the transect study, following a release from diseased potato tubers in soil, its fate should it enter waterways and the potential for a diversity of plants to serve as reservoirs of the bacterium. The capability of the bacterium to enter a viable-nonculturable state, which would escape current certified detection methods will be assessed. Furthermore, the response of R. solanacearum to stressful conditions encountered in soil and water systems, potentially leading to a multiply-stress resistant physiological state, will be determined. The data on ecological fate obtained in soil will be linked to feasible practical measures, i.e. effects of solarization, inundation, covering of fields with farmer's plastic and addition of organic materials will be assessed. Data obtained in water systems will serve to predict R. solanacearum persistence and spread, its potential for growth at low substrate concentrations, and its extinction as a result of the prevailing ecological conditions. A fourth project task will address the potential for development of an antagonistic microflora in selected soil systems, resulting in suppressive soils. An advanced molecular fingerprinting method will be used hand-inhand with a cultivation-based approach, in order to unravel the structure of the microbial communities in suppressive versus conducive situations, and a link will be sought between both data sets. Dominant members of the culturable fraction will be screened for their capacity to inhibit R. solanacearum. The aggressiveness of selected novel isolates will be determined and used in an assessment of the threat these pose to European potato cropping. In addition, an R. solanacearum resistance gene with potential for use in potato will be tested for its capacity to ward off infection pressure by a range of pathogen isolates. The data obtained from the transect study, from the ecological fate studies and from the suppressiveness studies set in the perspective of farmer's measures, will serve to define a set of recommendations (guidelines) useful in the definition of feasible non-chemical disease management practices.",1,0
759,34892,No,Recruitment processes in cod and haddock: developing new approaches,"The overall objective of the project was to evaluate methodologies for partitioning sources of variability in gadoid recruitment between effects due to spawning stock structure (ie. age composition, spatial distribution) and those due to the environment. This represents a significant advance on earlier approaches, which have focussed on single classes of processes. The approach to this problem was twofold:  - Develop an environmental survival index, based on sound understanding of processes, so that a more realistic specification of the statistical error distribution about stock recruitment relationships can be provided.  - Establish the importance of the structure of the spawning stock, by accounting for the non-linearity between stock biomass and viable egg production, thereby allowing an examination of the potential value of manipulating stock-structure to reduce the probability of low recruitment.  To achieve this the project has developed a conceptual framework within which the following i specific objectives are addressed through a combination of field measurements, studies in mesocosms and the laboratory, and modelling:  - determine the relationship between spawning stock structure and the timing, duration and amplitude of egg production,  - determine the relationship between female age, size and condition and the viability of eggs and larvae,  - determine the relative contribution of the various components of the annual egg production to the surviving population of pelagic juveniles,  - determine the relationship between larval growth rate and survival,  - determine the environmental factors which influence individual growth rate and derive a suite of environmental parameters which could provide an index of their contribution to year-class survival,  - evaluate methodologies for coupling environmental indices of survival to data derived on the effects of stock structure, so that their relative importance can be evaluated. THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT ARE:  - The timing and distribution of spawning activity in both cod and haddock populations studied is strongly related to the age and size composition of the adult stock,  - The size and viability of larvae is strongly related to the size of eggs, which is in turn related to batch number, size and spawning history of the adult females,  - For North Sea haddock, the juvenile fish surviving to the demersal phase in August were not drawn at random from the annual egg production by the adult stock. In 1996, spawnings in early April contributed a disproportionate number of recruits,  - A patch tracking study of larval haddock growth and survival showed that hatch date, rather than short term variations in environmental conditions contributed most to the variability in individual growth rates, and hence to survival. The fastest growing individuals in the study were from spawnings in early April,  - Laboratory experiments showed that signatures of diet composition and feeding rate of reared cod and haddock larvae can be detected in the biochemical composition of individuals. However, there was little relationship between these indices and temporal variations in environmental conditions during the patch tracking study in the North Sea. Larvae appeared to be feeding maximally under the range of conditions encountered-during the study.  - Turbulence regimes, representative of those encountered in the field can be generated artificially in mesocosms. Protocols for conducting experiments on the effects of turbulence on larval fish feeding and growth have been developed. However, simulation modelling indicates that current theory is not sufficiently robust to predict the consequences of such experiments,  - Strategic modelling of the interaction of growth and mortality rates for the composition of larval fish populations shows that short-term variability in growth rates can significantly modify, and in some cases mask, the outcome. These results were partly confirmed by rearing experiments in mesocosms. No relationship between growth and mortality rates could be detected in the results from the patch tracking study on larval haddock,  - Modelling predictions of the most favourable hatch-sites for subsequent growth of larval cod and haddock in the North Sea matched closely with the observed distributions of eggs of the two species,  - The project has developed a strategy for integrating models of egg production by cod and haddock spawning stocks with bio-physical models of egg and larval dispersal and survival, to produce a system capable of evaluating the relative contributions of stock structure and environmental effects on recruitment.  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  Maternal effects and egg production  Samples of cod were obtained from four areas in Icelandic waters (2 offshore and 2 inshore) and of haddock from two areas in the North Sea. Potential fecundity and the incidence of pre-ovulatory atresia were measured by a variety of methods. Data on atresia allow estimation of the proportion of potential egg production which is resorbed by the ovaries rather than being shed.  This study provides the first estimates of potential fecundity in Icelandic cod since 1967. The new estimates are significantly higher than those from the earlier period for fish of equivalent size and age, possibly reflecting unfavourable environmental conditions and presumably low food levels during the late 1960's. This is especially true for the older fish in the population. Relative fecundity was shown to increase with age and size of cod and to be influence by liver condition. This study has also been the first to estimate the realised fecundity of haddock, ie. the number of eggs that are actually spawned as opposed to the number of oocytes present in the ovaries of the female stock. Age, size and spatial differences were demonstrated for the North Sea populations.  The study indicates that size and age-specific differences in reproductive development are important for protracted spawning. Results from the comparison of size and age of mature females suggested that in both cod and haddock the largest females begin spawning first. In haddock, but not in cod, the age of females also seems to be related to the onset of spawning, the older females tending to begin spawning earlier than young ones. The duration of spawning also appears to be related to size and age. In Iceland, the size of eggs produced by the spawning population decreased as the season progressed. This effect was most pronounced in the larger females in the population. In addition, female body size and egg diameter were directly related.  Detailed laboratory and mesocosm studies on the characteristics of eggs and larvae in relation to female attributes found initial batches of eggs from repeat spawners were larger than those from recruit spawners, but eggs in the final batches were the same size. The dry weight of larvae decreased with batch number, and was independent of previous spawning experience. Viability and swimming activity of larvae decreased with batch number for recruit spawners but not for repeat spawners, but feeding incidence and growth rates of larvae were not related to batch number.  Field and laboratory studies of larval growth and survival  The range of birth dates estimated by back calculation from otolith ring counts of both pelagic and demersal juvenile haddock sampled in the North Sea showed temporal differences in survivorship with most of the surviving demersal juveniles in August originating from spawning in early April. The environmental basis for variability in the survival rate of gadold larvae was investigated during a drift tracking study of a patch of larval North Sea haddock to the east of the Shetland Islands during May 1996. The patch of larvae was tracked for around 10 days during which sampling was carried out on a 6h schedule. A wide range of meteorological conditions were encountered during the study, which coincided with the onset of the spring phytoplankton bloom. Analysis of the microstructure of otoliths removed from larvae failed to show a consistent relationship between individual daily growth rates and short-term (day-to-day) variability in environmental factors such as food concentration and turbulence. However, there was strong relationship between individual growth rate and birthdate, with later spawned individuals in the tracked patch having higher growth rates. Time series data on the vertical distribution of haddock larvae showed a strong tendency for the larvae to aggregate in mid-water (25-50m depth). During daylight there was a slight movement of the population towards the surface, whilst the population was distributed deeper in the water column at night. For the largest size groups of larvae, this behaviour was modified by wind-induced turbulence. During calm periods the larvae ascended behaviour was modif closer to the surface during daylight than during windy periods.  A range of individual-based biochemical parameters were measured on haddock larvae co llected during the drift study, and laboratory calibrations of these parameters were carried out on reared cod and haddock larvae. The laboratory studies showed that differences in food abundance have a significant effect on lipid-based condition indices in early larval haddock. However, free fatty acid levels in larval cod were found to be insensitive to short-term variations in food abundance, rendering them unsuitable for application as short-term indicators of food consumption. Tryptic enzyme activities and gut fullness indices for haddock larvae captured during the field programme showed that feeding incidence was generally high but varied strongly according to a diel cycle. Day-to-day variations in tryptic enzyme activity were only weakly related to prey concentration and turbulent dissipation rates. Similarly, RNA/DNA ratios suggested that growth rates were generally not, or only weakly, related to either food concentration or turbulence during the 48 h prior to capture. However there were large variations in RNA, protein and lipid content between Individual haddock larvae of the same length, indicating wide variability within the population in growth, condition and the ability to survive stressful conditions (eg. low fooda bundance, attack by predators). Some of this variability can be attributed to the diet composition of the larvae since those individuals having a high proportion of lipids characteristic of diatom dominated food chains were in better condition (more lipid per body mass) than those with a high proportion of dinofiagellate tracer lipids. Overall, it seems that the growth of the haddock larvae in the patch was in general not limited by food, which was available in excess in the water column. Thus, short-term variations in turbulence and plankton concentration were not strongly reflected in otolith growth or the biochemical indices of growth.  MODELLING  The modelling aspects of the project have been on two levels. Firstly, strategic individual based modelling was used to explore the interaction between growth-dependent mortality and short-term variability in the growth rate of larvae, and the effects of turbulence on prey capture. Secondly, a spatially resolved individual based model of the dispersal and growth of cod and haddock larvae was developed for the North Sea.  The strategic modelling of growth-dependent mortality showed that linkage between growth rate and mortality rate has the power to substantially affect the composition of the surviving population. However, some conditions of fluctuating environmental conditions, leading fluctuating growth rates, could mask these effects. Data to test the conclusions were obtained during mesocosm experiments on cod larvae carried out in Norway. Replicate mesocosms we maintained under different feeding regimes and the otolith microstructure of the survivini, populations analysed at various stages. The results show that under high ration regimes the survivors in the population are drawn from the fastest growing components of the initial population. However, under low ration conditions the surviving population appeared to be drawn at random (with respect to daily growth rate) from the initial population.  The prey capture modelling showed that whilst turbulence in the water column can enhance the rate of encounter between larvae and their prey, the same factor can have a detrimental effect on the success of capture. Conclusions as to the response of larvae to turbulence are critically dependent on assumptions about the prey capture process, and to the representation of turbulent velocity structure in the model. The latter aspect was investigated during a series of mesocosm experiments during the project, in which the statistical structure of turbulence generated in enclosed systems was measured by various instruments.  The spatially resolved modelling concentrated on the population dynamics of cod and haddock larvae in the North Sea. A particle-tracking scheme, with water flow and temperature inputs from a hydrodynamic model of the NE Atlantic, was coupled to a simple representation of individual growth in the larvae. The objective was to determine the hatching origin of larvae with the highest probability of survival under climatological mean conditions. The results showed that, haddock larvae hatched on the outer continental shelf early in the season (late March) had a higher probability of survival than those hatched in the North Sea. However, as the season progressed through to May, the distribution of favourable hatch sites moved into the North Sea. A similar seasonal shift in the distribution of most favourable spawning areas occurred for cod. Comparison of the modelled distributions of favourable hatch sites showed a strong correlation with both the spatial and temporal distributions of spawning activity by haddock and cod stocks.     OVERALL CONCLUSIONS  At the simplest level, the project has exposed the complexity underlying the relationship between spawning stock biomass and recruitment. This has long been recognised, but uniquely, this project has simultaneously addressed the problem both from the perspective of the adult stock and the survival of larvae. Usually, such projects focus only on environmental considerations. The scope for recruitment variability due to the age and size composition and condition of the maternal stock seems greater than has previously been appreciated.  The integration of observational, experimental and modelling skills in the project has been particularly fruitful. An important development has been a framework for modelling the annual egg production by a fish stock, from routine assessment data supplemented with measurements of key biological parameters. The rationale for this model effectively synthesises the understanding of cod and haddock reproductive biology accumulated during the project. However, the key development has been the realisation that the surviving Juvenile population at recruitment is not drawn at random from the initial egg stock. This has been clearly demonstrated by the field programme on North Sea haddock, where the survivors originated mainly from a restricted temporal component of the annual egg production. It is clear from this work, and from the modelling studies, that spatial, temporal and maternal factors can all confer enhanced survival probability on eggs and larvae. As a result, the surviving juveniles can potentially originate from distinct subsets of the spawning distribution under given climatic and stock composition scenarios. This conclusion has major implications for the way in which the sustainability of fisheries is evaluated, and for the implementation of conservation measures. The developments produced by the project should provide a platform for incorporating these concepts into future fisheries management.  Publications  Gallego, A. & Heath, M. R. 1997.

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  Gadold fish produce very large numbers of eggs per individual, and only a small proportion survive to recruit to the adult stock. In the case of most NE Atlantic gadoid stocks the relationship between the abundance of the spawning stock and subsequent annual recruitment is generally obscured by a combination of factors. These include environmental effects on the survival of eggs and larvae and the use, for lack of alternative information, of spawning stock biomass as an index of the reproductive output of the adult population. Environmental factors exert strong control over the mortality rates of eggs and larvae, possibly through starvation but also through the dynamics of predator populations. At the same time, the survival of larval fish is linked to their growth rate. In general, the survival of fast growing individuals over a growth interval, will be higher than that of slow growing individuals. With regard to the reproductive output from the spawning population, egg production per unit biomass varies with the size, age and condition of the females, and so changes in the population structure associated with exploitation and annual differences in year-class strength are likely to have a major effect on population fecundity. These effects are not taken into account by conventional analyses of stock-recruitment relationships.  The aim of the project has been to establish the priorities and develop methods for investigating recruitment mechanisms in gadoid species, focussing on Icelandic and Norwegian cod stocks and North Sea haddock. The eventual aim is to be able to disaggregate the effects of changes in spawning stock structure on stock-recruitment relationships, from effects due to the environment. This is an important goal because it has the potential to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the models currently used to assess the sustainability of fisheries.  THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT ARE:  - The timing and distribution of spawning activity in both cod and haddock populations studied is strongly related to the age and size composition of the adult stock,  - The size and viability of larvae is strongly related to the size of eggs, which is in turn related to batch number, size and spawning history of the adult females,  - For North Sea haddock, the juvenile fish surviving to the demersal phase in August were not drawn at random from the annual egg production by the adult stock. In 1996, spawning in early April contributed a disproportionate number of recruits,  - A patch tracking study of larval haddock growth and survival showed that hatch date, rather than short term variations in environmental conditions contributed most to the variability in individual growth rates, and hence to survival. The fastest growing individuals in the study were from spawnings in early April,  - Laboratory experiments showed that signatures of diet composition and feeding rate of reared cod and haddock larvae can be detected in the biochemical composition of individuals. However, there was little relationship between these indices and temporal variations in environmental conditions during the patch tracking study in the North Sea. Larvae appeared to be feeding maximally under the range of conditions encountered-during the study.  - Turbulence regimes, representative of those encountered in the field can be generated artificially in mesocosms. Protocols for conducting experiments on the effects of turbulence on larval fish feeding and growth have been developed. However, simulation modelling indicates that current theory is not sufficiently robust to predict the consequences of such experiments,  - Strategic modelling of the interaction of growth and mortality rates for the composition of larval fish populations shows that short-term variability in growth rates can significantly modify, and in some cases mask, the outcome.

No relationship between growth and mortality rates could be detected in the results from the patch tracking study on larval haddock,  - Modelling predictions of the most favourable hatch-sites for subsequent growth of larval cod and haddock in the North Sea matched closely with the observed distributions of eggs of the two species,  - The project has developed a strategy for integrating models of egg production by cod and haddock spawning stocks with bio-physical models of egg and larval dispersal and survival, to produce a system capable of evaluating the relative contributions of stock structure and environmental effects on recruitment.",0,0
719,194557,No,Modulation of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System During Multiple Stages of the Poxvirus Lifecycle,"Vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypic poxvirus, is a large, enveloped, DNA virus characterized by its cytoplasmic site of replication and large subset of genes. Due to the complexity of VACV, the majority of studies focus on the virus rather than the host cell. Thus the repertoire of cell factors and functions required for its replication remain largely unknown. Our previous work to define a subset of these, revealed the cellular degradation machinery as a key requirement of VACV replication. Our findings indicated that ubiquitin (Ub), Ub ligase activity, and proteasome-mediated degradation are required for multiple stages of the virus lifecycle. The aim of this proposal is to reveal how VACV differentially modulates or takes advantage of the Ub proteasome system during genome uncoating, the initiation of DNA replication, and the assembly of progeny virions. For genome uncoating we will characterize the spatial and temporal interactions between ubiquitinated viral proteins, proteasomes, the viral uncoating factor, and the viral genome that occur on cytoplasmic cores. To ascertain how Cullin-3 based ubiquitination and proteasome degradation facilitate the switch from uncoating to replication of the viral genome, we will identify the relevant Cullin-3 substrates in the context of a detailed characterization of viral replication initiation sites. Coming full circle, we will explore the mechanisms used by VACV to modulate cellular degradation such that ubiquitinated viral core proteins are packaged into newly forming virions without being degraded. Using systems biology, virology, cell biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and a wide range of microscopy approaches we will unravel the complex interactions between poxviruses and the host cell degradation machinery. In turn, as viruses often serve as valuable tools to study cell function, this work is likely to uncover new insights into how cells spatially and temporally regulate their own degradative capacities.",0,0
18,48279,Yes,Glucomannan : a new vegetal texturising agent for european food and non-food industries,"Glucomannan is an hydrocolloidal polysaccharide consisting of mannose and glucose polymers, obtained from the tubers of various species of Amorphophallus commonly named 'konjac' or'elephant yam'. Konjac glucomannan is a product already widely used in Asian countries and the United States for its unique functional properties (viscosifying action and synergy with other natural gums). Raw material is mainly produced in several Asian countries, without reliable and consistent knowledge in agricultural and process management. The products actually exported to Europe (for diet food and pet food) are rarely of consistent quality and do not meet EU standards for industrial food markets. Having received recently a tentative european agreement number as food additive (E425), the konjac flour will be imported in large quantities. For this reason, a standardised glucomannan european source, contributing to agricultural diversification, will also improve the EU trade balance In order to secure the growing demand from the Western Food and non-food Industries, the proposed project will thus assess upgrading and standardisation of konjac glucomannan by : in EU countries. Knowledge acquired on glucomannan functionalities in formulations.   Assessment of crop feasibility and profitability will be achieved through adaptability and agricultural trial in two contrasting EU pedo-climatic conditions. Development of an industrial complete refining process will be undertaken for standardisation of glucomannan quality, up to industrial scale. Setting up of a range of tailor made blends with specific functional properties will be done, after end-uses industrial tests.   This market driven project, mainly set up by european skilled private companies including 3 SMES', will thus set-up an integrated agro-industrial production chain of glucomannan, from primary production to food and non-food industrial applications.",1,1
519,34525,No,Development of an Advanced Rheological Tool for Polymer Melt Characterisation,"Today, all major chemical companies active in the  commodity plastics markets (such as Polyethylene (PE),  Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS)) are developing  technologies to a) improve their manufacturing cost  position, b) differentiate products for higher added  value markets and c) reduce the product development cycle  time. This is achieved by designing and producing  materials with specific molecular structures and  molecular weight distributions, for example with the  relatively new metallocene technology. In the upcoming  decade this development in polymer catalysis and  synthesis will undoubtedly lead to tailormade materials  that, in many cases, require tailor made processing  conditions and even new processing equipment. The  successful and timely (time to market) development of  new, differentiated grades requires detailed knowledge of  the rheological behavior of polymer melts at realistic  processing conditions since mechanical and optical  product properties such as yield strength, elongation at  break, Young's modulus, optical anisotropy and  dimensional stability, largely depend on processing  history. For polymer melts this means that a thorough  understanding of the viscoelastic constitutive behavior  becomes increasingly important. The availability of  reliable constitutive models, associated material  parameters and robust numerical analysis tools would  allow an early investigation of the performance of a new  grade in industrial processes and thereby provide vital  information to the molecular design process. However, no  generally accepted way to extract the relevant  rheological parameters from experiments has been worked  out ,   nor is there a consensus on the most appropriate  constitutive equations. A third reason that impedes a  wider use of viscoelastic flow simulations today is the  lack of a critical assessment of the reliability of  available (time consuming) simulation programs in model  flow situations that are simple enough for rigorous  experimental control. The outlined Advanced Rheological  Tool (ART) development project defines a pertinent way to  overcome the said obstacles. In the ART project, via a  close cooperation of experienced Universities and  industrial laboratories, stateof the art experimental  techniques to measure velocities and stresses are  combined with robust numerical algorithms to analyse  viscoelastic flows. The key objectives of this project  are to obtain a detailed evaluation of the performance of  constitutive equations in prototype industrial flows and  to identify material parameters at realistic  circumstances. This not only yields improved,  experimentally validated, constitutive models, but also  has a direct impact on the design of materials with  requested processing properties. In conclusion, the ART  project bridges the gap between material design.  classical rheological characterisation and the  application of advanced, realistic constitutive models to  the analysis of industrial flows.

369,45878,No,On line continuous aroma extraction from agrofood processing wastes,"The main objective of this project is to develop a new technology on resins which will enable extraction and selective recovery of aromatic compounds from food processing wastes. Indeed, nowadays, food industry does not have technologies efficient enough to avoid aromatic losses and to recover the whole aromatic compounds of the product. It results in many losses and biochemical changes which affect the quality of the extracted flavour. The main objectives of the project are: * The development of a continuous process to recover flavours from agro-food processing wastes on-line. This is an important innovation as actual processes are batch one. This is a necessary goal in order to achieve the economical viability for the system.* Improvements for the agro-food industry: amelioration of the taste by using natural reinforcements at low cost.* Taking into account the increasing demand of high quality natural products from consumers. Consumers are now more aware of green issues and are rejecting artificial substances in favour of natural alternative. There is a growing trend in favour of aromatic extracts for a number of large scale uses, including flavouring, fragrances, agricultural, pharmaceutical or medicinal preparations.* Conversion of environmentally-unfriendly wastes into food or non food ingredients. There is considerable industrial and political pressure to convert wastes into useful products. This project will bring together European partners to develop means for exploiting wastes for the extraction of high quality and commercially valuable products. SMEs will be very interested in the results of the project because they will find a new way to valorise their wastes with a high added value. Indeed, the flavour consuming branches of activity are a very interesting target for agro-food industry.The economic gain will be important. Many studies have been carried out in the wine industry (the added value of the recovered product represent up to 5% per bottle) results obtained could be easily extrapolated to other products (fruit, beer...).

The OBELIX project will examine the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in food plays a role in the development of obesity later in life. OBELIX proposes a multidisciplinary approach that combines epidemiology, neonatology, endocrinology, toxicology, analytical chemistry and risk assessment to address the objectives of the project: 1) To assess prenatal exposure in humans to major classes of EDCs in food identified as potential inducers of obesity (i.e. dioxins, non- and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, brominated flame retardants, phthalates and perfluorinated alkyl acids) using mother-child cohorts from four European regions with different food contaminant exposure patterns; 2) To relate early life exposure to EDCs with clinical markers, novel biomarkers and health effect data related to obesity; 3) To perform hazard characterization of in utero exposure to EDCs for the development of obesity later in life, using dose-response analysis in a rodent model; 4) To determine mechanisms of action of obesogenic EDCs on developmental programming with genomics and epigenetic analysis in in vivo and in vitro models; and, 5) to perform risk assessment of prenatal exposure to obesogenic EDCs in food, by integrating maternal exposure through food, contaminant exposure and health effect data in children, and hazard data. The outcomes of OBELIX are of particular relevance to the Work Programme, as the proposed project will generate new knowledge about prenatal exposure to major classes of EDCs in food that are potential inducers of obesity and related metabolic diseases later in life. It will also contribute new knowledge about effects of early exposure to EDCs on human health, including causality in animal models and possible mechanisms.",1,1

Such companies have to deal with very short term orders, while maintaining a high degree of customer satisfaction and low prices. The five ASPIRE consortium's SME core proposers are each facing such a situation and have initiated this project in order to get a decision and negociation support to tackle it. At the end of the project, these SMEs intend to use a decision support software tool dedicated to respond to their specific production planning needs, and that also responds to the need they have to negociate with their customers and suppliers as they schedule their production. There is actually no industrial software product that matches the ASPIRE requirements. This undoubtfully shall constitute a significant advance in the domain of management of production SMEs, as the existing scheduling softwares of the market, although managing the degrees of freedom which are available at the workshop level (alternative resources, changes in working hours and so on), do not provide any support in specific topics such as: - taking into account data pervaded by imprecision and uncertainty (e.g. expected orders or expected workload) in order to obtain the expected cycle time of an order, providing and efficient way to systematically test different scenarios that can satisfy a delay, assessing these scenarios using a multi criteria approach (i.e. taking into account the customer's satisfaction but also the satisfaction of internal constraints such as the optimisation of the resource use) providing a support in order to re use past experience, by storing and retrieving comparable situations when a decision has to be made.",0,0
958,104488,No,New proxies to quantify continental climate development during the Pliocene,"Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have risen rapidly since pre-industrial times and our current climate is not yet in equilibrium with this; it will change. To obtain insight in the type and magnitude of this change and to validate climate models used to project these changes, we need to look back at past climates. The most recent time in Earth history with CO2 levels that were similar to today is the Pliocene. The Pliocene thus provides a unique window into a world that exhibited many of the climate characteristics that we might experience. These are documented by proxies locked into sedimentary archives, especially marine sediments. It remains a challenge for palaeoclimatologists, however, to quantify past terrestrial temperatures. I have recently developed a novel proxy for quantitative annual mean air temperature reconstruction, which is based on the distribution of membrane lipids synthesised by soil bacteria. Upon soil erosion these molecules are transported to the marine realm where they become part of the marine sedimentary archive.  The PlioProx project aims at a quantitative reconstruction of continental temperatures and latitudinal temperature gradients for the Pliocene. This will be achieved by applying this new palaeothermometer to high resolution marine sediment records near river outflows to generate river-basin integrated records of continental air temperature. This approach also allows for a direct comparison to reconstructed sea surface temperatures. Using globally distributed sediment records, latitudinal temperature gradients will be constructed which will be compared to moisture transport and rainout, reconstructed using stable hydrogen isotopes from plant wax lipids. Results will provide vital new insights in climate evolution on land under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

171,222681,Yes,FlAgship demonstration of industrial scale production of nutrient Resources from Mealworms to develop a bioeconomY New Generation,"The world faces a major challenge with the sharp increase in demand for meat and fish by 2050, to which current modes of production, whether through agriculture, aquaculture or fisheries, cannot be sustained. An innovative solution to this predicted shortage of resources, especially protein, lies in insect production and processing which can provide a serious response, but to date no industrial scale of production of insect-derived products has been reached. The FARMYNG project has this ambition to develop on an industrial and automated scale the breeding and transformation of insects for the production of animal nutrition, with the strong participation of 20 key actors all along the value chain from the feedstock supply to the final insect transformation. FARMYNG will demonstrate a large-scale, first-of-its-kind bio-based value chain producing sustainable, safe and premium feed products from an innovative origin: the Tenebrio molitor insect (mealworm). The plant developed for FARMYNG will use the efficiency of mealworm physiology to convert vegetal by-products in mealworm biomass and transform those mealworms into sustainable proteins and lipids for fish feed and pet food end markets. In parallel, manure will be recovered for soil fertilization applications. Insects are indeed very effective at converting organic matter. Fed with no-noble materials, insects multiply quickly, and are a rich and natural source of food for certain livestock and pet animals, and probably ultimately for the Humans directly. Insects also emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia and use less water and land than other animal proteins value chains. FARMYNG project, responding to the increasing worldwide proteins demand, will transfer the technology from a demo plant to the Industrial Flagship Plant able to produce almost 1 500 tons of proteins and 400 tons of oil per month, reaching a productions rate never demonstrated before for insect’s proteins production plant.",1,1
481,107436,No,Elucidation of forskolin biosynthetic pathway in Coleus forskohlii,"Coleus forskholii is a shrub of the Lamiaceae family, used as an ayurverdic medicinal plant. The roots of this plant are producing a labdane type diterpene named forskolin, known mainly for its pharmaceutical activity for protection against heart failure problems, hypertension treatment as it acts as vasodilator, anti-inflammatory properties and its effects in treating respiratory track problems. The medicinal activities of forskolin are due to its ability to activate the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and therefore to increase the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the cells. Today it is known that forskolin is produced exclusively by the roots of the species Coleus forskohlii, together with a plethora of different diterpenes, hence its availability is restricted. Thus, the aim of this research proposal is to set the base for the elucidation of the coleus diterpenoids pathways and second to generate production platforms for the controlled biotechnological synthesis of the metabolites of interest. This will be achieved using state of the art technologies and methodologies. New generation sequencing will be used for deep sequencing of the root bark transcriptome (the specialized root tissue responsible for the synthesis and accumulation of forskolin). Genes involved in forskolin and other diterpenoids production will be identified from the generated data bases, will be cloned and functionally characterized for identifying their exact role in the pathways. Upon characterization, selected genes will be expressed in the microbe yeast and/or in the moss Physcomitrella (a novel plant based terpenoid production platform, exhibiting numerous advantages in comparison with microbial systems) for the sustainable production of pure bioactive diterpenoids, which will enable the studies of the therapeutical properties of these metabolites but also the future scalable-up applications to meet pharmaceutical/commercial interests.",0,0
1043,200482,No,Exploiting vortices to suppress dispersion and reach new separation power boundaries,"The 21st century is expected to develop towards a society depending ever and ever more on (bio-)chemical measurements of fluids and matrices that are so complex they are well beyond the current analytical capabilities. Incremental improvements can no longer satisfy the current needs of e.g. the proteomics field, requiring the separation of tens of thousands of components. The pace of progress in these fields is therefore predominantly determined by that of analytical tools, whereby liquid chromatography is the most prominent technique to separate small molecules as well as macromolecules, based on differential interaction of each analyte with support structures giving it a unique migration velocity. To improve its performance, a faster transport between these structures needs to be generated. Unfortunately the commonly pursued strategy, relying on diffusion and reducing the structure size, has come to its limits due to practical limitations related to packing and fabrication of sub-micron support structures, pressure tolerance and viscous heating. A ground-breaking step to advance chromatographic performance to another level would be to accelerate mass transport in the lateral direction, beyond the rate of diffusion only. To meet this requirement, an array of microstructures and local electrodes can be defined to create lateral electroosmotic vortices in a pressure-driven column, aiming to accelerate the local mass transfer in an anisotropic fashion. The achievement of ordered arrays of vortices is intimately linked to this requirement, which is also of broader importance for mixing, anti-fouling of membrane and reactor surfaces, enhanced mass transfer in reactor channels, emulsification, etc. Understanding and implementing anisotropic vortex flows will therefore not only revolutionize analytical and preparative separation procedures, but will also be highly relevant in all flow systems that benefit from enhanced mass transfer.",0,0
712,206942,No,Persistent and Transportable Hyperpolarization for Magnetic Resonance,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and are two well-established powerful and versatile tools that are extensively used in many fields of research, in clinics and in industry. Despite considerable efforts involving highly sophisticated instrumentation, these techniques suffer from low sensitivity, which keeps many of today’s most interesting problems in modern analytical sciences below the limits of MR detection.  Hyperpolarization (HP) in principle provides a solution to this limitation. We have recently pioneered breakthrough approaches using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP) for preparing nuclear spins in highly aligned states, and therefore boosting sensitivity in several proof-of-concept reports on model systems. The proposed project aims to leverage these new advances through a series of new concepts i) to generate the highest possible hyperpolarization that can be transported in a persistent state, and ii) to demonstrate their use in magnetic resonance experiments with > 10’000 fold sensitivity enhancements, with the potential of revolutionizing the fields of MRI and NMR. By physically separating the source of polarization from the substrate at a microscopic level, we will achieve polarized samples with lifetimes of days that can be stored and transported over long distances to MRI centers, hospitals and NMR laboratories. Notable applications in the fields of drug discovery, metabolomics and real-time metabolic imaging in living animals will be demonstrated. These goals require a leap forward with respect to today’s protocols, and we propose to achieve this through a combination of innovative sample formulations, new NMR methodology and advanced instrumentation. This project will yield to a broadly applicable method revolutionizing analytical chemistry, drug discovery and medical diagnostics, and thereby will provide a powerful tool to solve challenges at the forefront of molecular and chemical sciences today.",0,0
351,195256,No,Molecular determination of Rif1-Associated Genomic Elements and their function in regulating genome activity and integrity,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic and must usually be accurately repaired to prevent oncogenic mutations. However, DSBs also represent necessary intermediates of recombination events required to create genetic diversity in immune repertoires and the germline. These distinct cellular contexts require that DSBs are differentially metabolised to achieve the required genetic outcome. Thus a complex system has evolved to regulate DSB repair. Rif1 was recently identified as a critical regulator of DSB repair, recruited to chromatin at DSBs by the 53BP1 chromatin reader. However, little is known about how these proteins cooperate to alter the chromatin landscape at DNA damage sites, and how this influences DNA repair decisions. Understanding the molecular basis of these proteins function is paramount, as misregulation at the level of Rif1/53BP1 is known to drive disease: loss of either protein results in primary immunodeficiency, while an inability to counteract Rif1/53BP1-dependent activities during DNA repair is associated with genomic instability that drives carcinogenesis. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that Rif1 may also mediate gene-repression in certain chromatin contexts. This raises the possibility that the manner by which Rif1 regulates transcriptional control may be similar to its role in DNA repair. In this proposal, I seek to test my hypothesis that Rif1 mediates repressive chromatin states to regulate both transcription and DNA repair outcomes. My preliminary work and an array of unique cell lines and molecular reagents developed by my host laboratory, provide me with a unique and timely opportunity to examine this fascinating protein, and develop a better understanding of potentially common regulatory mechanisms that govern transcription and DNA repair.",0,0

Such cortico-cortical induced potentials can be used to infer functional and anatomical brain connectivity.  We will develop methods to analyse those responses using neuroimaging tools in order to create a new probabilistic atlas of functional tractography of the human brain, which will be made freely available to the clinical and neuroscience community. Several thousands of stimulation runs performed in several hundreds of patients will be included in the atlas database to reach a nearly full coverage of the human cortex (inclusion of 540 patients retrospectively and of 172 patients/year prospectively, from 8 French and 1 Czech epilepsy surgery centres). As a proof of concept, we generated for F-TRACT scientific document a preliminary database of 1535 stimulation runs performed in 35 adult patients. To illustrate the potential of our approach, in particular to refine neurobiological models of cognitive systems, we use here this preliminary atlas to demonstrate the asymmetry of the functional connectivity between Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area, two key nodes of the language network.  This new atlas of functional tractography will be very useful to understand how the brain works and to develop neurocomputational models at a large scale. It will also allow the development of new clinical tools for the presurgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. It is very complementary to other structural and functional approaches, such as MRI diffusion and functional mapping derived from metabolic, optical and electromagnetic techniques. The open access to this unique atlas of functional tractography will allow to explore in the future its numerous properties in relation to distributed brain networks in the domains of neuroanatomy, neurocognition and neurophysiopathology.'",0,0

Scientific expertise: The EST will provide early-stage researchers with a structured training programme on feeding behaviour and control of food intake and appetite in three top European institutes located in Paris, Munich, and London, and they will also have access to one of the biggest European food industries. The synergy provided by this multiple partnership will represent an important added value by covering the latest experimental, theoretical and applied aspects.

It is well known that the increase in data rate and heterogeneous transport in wireless networks demands very efficient coding schemes, coupled with adaptive resource allocation strategies. Beside the recent progress made these last 15 years, coded modulation schemes presenting near-Shannon performance at high spectral efficiency with short blocks are still missing. Besides, whilst most of the European technology has focused on Turbo-Codes (3GPP, DVB-RCS, IEEE 802.16), it has facilitated as a side effect development of the competing technology, namely LDPC codes worldwide (3GPP2, DVB-S2, IEEE 802.11n).<br/>In order to ensure European supremacy in enabling technologies mandatory for IMT-Advanced systems, the DaVinci project plans to go beyond usual LDPC codes, and develop breakthrough channel coding, together with tailored Link Level technologies. The DaVinci solution is based on systems which completely operate using high order nonbinary symbols, in all receiver blocks. However, the expected performance gain comes at the expense of increased hardware complexity, and unsolved technical issues such as nonbinary Hybrid-ARQ strategies, or nonbinary turbo-receivers. Consequently, low complexity nonbinary LDPC codes/decoders will be developed in the DaVinci project, and compared in a realistic framework, using a versatile FPGA implementation and real link using a MIMO-OFDM platform.<br/>Our consortium has a strong expertise in the design of efficient, but practical B3G/4G communication systems, and we believe that the joint design of the code, the resource allocation and the hardware model is the necessary basis for proposing better systems for next generation wireless networks.

616,218591,No,Spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity shape neural circuits in the developing brain,"To generate brain circuits that are both flexible and stable requires the coordination of powerful developmental mechanisms acting at different scales. How does the brain prepare to efficiently compute information and reliably generate behavior during early development without any previous experience? A prominent transient feature of developing circuits is the ability to generate spontaneous activity before sensory organs mature. We know little about the detailed structure of this activity; however, blocking or perturbing this activity leads to miswiring defects, suggesting its powerful role in shaping local and brain-wide neural circuits. After the onset of sensory experience, ongoing activity continues to modify sensory circuits, and plays an important functional role in the mature brain. Together with advances in experimental techniques, we propose that theory and models are needed to establish a unifying framework of neural circuit development. Using quantitative data analysis, experiment-driven theory and computational modeling, we will derive key principles for how neural circuits are built and organized during early postnatal development into functional units, and how they are modified by intact and perturbed sensory-evoked activity. We will provide a quantitative analysis of longitudinal recordings of single neuron and network activity for the first time by synthesizing data from three collaborating labs. Our goal will be to reveal novel aspects of this activity that drive circuit refinement over a prolonged timescale during development, and to identify the powerful ways in which activity and circuit properties influence each other. Our models will generate and test hypotheses for how individual components affect different aspects of circuit organization during development. Therefore, the unique potential of our theoretical approach lies in dissecting the influence of each developmental process, making predictions to be tested in the real biological system.",0,0

With its € 9,2 billion segment, Italy is a leader country in the production of traditional ceramics, while France, UK and Germany are driving countries for advanced ceramics, growing at 21% per year. Advanced ceramics are crucial for new technologies and nano-tech applications addressed to thermo-mechanical and bio-medical applications, while traditional ceramics have a worldwide market and have been suggested as materials minimizing the impact on the environment (when compared to other finishing materials). It may seem surprising that the strong industrial production of ceramic components is still based on empirically engineered processes, often poorly understood and difficult to control (Ewsuk, 1997). Consequently, there is a relatively large production of rejects and still broad margins for further process optimization. To this purpose, in-depth scientific understanding of the production processing is required, in order to reduce costs of ceramic component design and manufacturing and to produce ceramic components more reproducibly with improved performance and reliability. In particular, forming by powder compaction, binder burnout and sintering are the most sensible processes (Reed, 1995; Rahaman, 2006). The main aim of the research project is to develop novel advanced ceramic products in close collaboration between academic and industrial partners which will be directly oriented to industrial and social needs.

495,108600,No,Tropical forest soil carbon storage and microbial diversity under climatic warming,"'The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems is likely to be strongly affected by climate change but the direction and magnitude of the resulting climate feedbacks are uncertain. Soils contain the largest reservoir of global terrestrial carbon so even small fractional changes in total soil carbon cycling could have significant impacts on the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The response of soil carbon to environmental change is, therefore, a critical regulator of future climate. A widespread prediction is that the projected increase in mean global temperature will increase microbial mineralization of stable soil organic matter and release carbon from soil into the atmosphere; and that the biology (microbial functional diversity) rather than chemistry of soil may be more important in determining long-term carbon storage. This prediction, based on temperate forest and laboratory studies, is of particular concern for tropical forests because they have huge influence on the global carbon cycle, contain 30% of global soil carbon and have the highest -and most threatened- biodiversity of any terrestrial ecosystem. Here, I will use two different experimental approaches (in situ soil warming and soil translocation) in tropical forests in Panama and Peru to examine how soil chemistry and biology regulate soil carbon storage under climatic warming. I will combine experimental findings with a study of soil chemistry and biology for an additional twenty global tropical forest sites to make predictions on the future of soil carbon in global tropical forests under scenarios of climatic warming. This will be the first study of elevated temperature effects on soil carbon dynamics, and of continental-scale patterns in soil microbial diversity, in tropical forests. I will directly address one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in global carbon cycling models by showing how microbial soil carbon cycling in tropical forests will respond to climatic warming.'",1,0
520,58406,No,Injection lasing in organic thin films,"Organic semiconductor devices offer the advantages of easy processing, low cost and flexibility. Light-emitting diodes (OLED), thin-film transistors (OTFT) and solar cells (OSC) have been shown so far. The demonstration of the organic injection laser has been recently withdrawn. It is the purpose of this project to explore injection lasing in organic semiconductors at the solid state. The main difficulty for realizing an organic injection laser is that the device is to support the required high current density. We tackle this problem from two sides. We maximize the current-carrying capability of the device by using charge transport crystalline organic material in a TFT configuration. Simultaneously, efforts are done to limit the required current density, by using a highly efficient energy transfer light emitting system in which the energy acceptor and emitting site is a coordinated metal complex.  OBJECTIVES The main objective of the project is to explore the effect of organic injection lasing that is based on organic semiconductors in solid state. On the way to realizing this objective, several results and milestones of the proposal form sub-objectives, that are extremely useful in themselves: 1. The synthesis of coordinated metal complexes with high quantum yield and low lasing threshold, where the metal can either be a rare earth or a transition metal. Such complexes are valued for efficient organic electroluminescence; 2. The realization of efficient OLEDs with the synthesized new coordinated metal complexes. 3. Achieve effective ambipolar conduction in organic crystalline solid. This is useful for organic transistors, since ambipolar conduction is a cornerstone to implement complementary logic OTFT circuits.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK Our goal is to explore the effect of organic semiconductors injection lasing. The strategy to reach this goal includes work on three levels: device structure, organic semiconductor growth and material synthesis. The device will have a transistor (TFT)-like structure. The presence of a gate will allows balancing electron and hole injection for more efficient recombination. Furthermore, the organic transport layer can be grown as a crystalline with much higher in-plane mobility than in a vertical OLED structure with amorphous organic layers. Also, the electric field in the recombination region is smaller than for OLEDs, and hence exciting breaking can be avoided. The TFT structure can include optical cladding layers. Organic semiconductor growth is the second key to the project. The current density required for lasing is much higher than for the operation of an OLED, and it can only be supported if efficient ambipolar conduction is achieved. Our goal is to achieve ambipolar conduction in organic semiconductors.  With proper growth conditions in ultra high vacuum is possible to obtain crystalline solids, which will allow ambipolar conduction to occur. The third key element that we introduce is an efficient luminescent material. Energy transfer systems that employ coordinated metal complexes as acceptor can be synthesized to be very efficient emitters. In addition, the spontaneous radiative lifetime in such complexes is long. This allows reaching the population inversion threshold more easily, and hence to reduce the lasing threshold. New complexes will be designed, synthesised and characterized.

On the other hand, Hypertension (HTN) is a condition, mostly encountered in patients suffering from AF, although only half of these individuals have this condition under control, and only 20% are unaware that they have HTN. Besides the health risks associated with these conditions, there is a lack of non-obtrusive, non-inflating, non-invasive, small, precise, easy-to-use devices for continuous monitoring of vital signs, including AF and blood pressure. Cardiac Sense Ltd is an Israeli start-up established in 2009, with a vision of developing innovative non-invasive technology for monitoring vital signs. We are developing CardiacSense (TRL6), a clinically-proven medical solution that reliably delivers non-invasive and non-inflating heart arrhythmia and blood pressure monitoring, 23/365 for as long as needed. It mainly consists of a wearable (a watch), highly sensitive, error-free (introducing an artefact sensor), real-time measuring device, that is non-invasive (no surgery needed), easy to use (no training needed) and allows for a great connectivity (providing easy data storage and sharing). Our solution is based on optical PPG sensor technology to monitor heart AF and BP. In addition, we are the first company to develop a unique artefact sensor that detects finger and wrist movements that affect the PPG signal by increasing false positive results. Our solution thus has a medical grade accuracy level of pulse measurement. Through this project we aim to finalize its development and launch it to the market, with a potential to save around €800M to EU healthcare and save up to 5,000 lives yearly, and to boost our company's growth to \€7.5M revenues, and \20 new jobs by 2025.",0,0

This proposal offers to develop therefore a next-generation biomedical imaging platform, designed to radically impact biomedical and drug discovery applications. The imaging strategy aims at resolving powerful optical reporters (fluorescent proteins, nanoparticles, optical probes) with 10-100 micron resolution and femptomole sensitivity through several millimeters to centimeters of tissue. This performance brings unprecedented ability to non-invasively visualize biological and molecular processes in-vivo in intact organisms over time.  To achieve these goals, the proposal considers first the development of multi-spectral opto-acoustic tomography (MSOT) as a high performance method for revolutionizing biomedical imaging.

57,221709,Yes,Illuminating black boxes in the nitrogen cycle,"With an increasing world population growth, prediction of climate change on the sustainability and resilience of farming ecosystems is key. Since the nitrogen cycle's role within the farming ecosystem is of utmost importance, and an environmental disturbance leads to farming production loss, understanding the cycle's resilience is crucial. The main actors within this cycle are microorganisms, yet these are ignored when predicting ecological effects to climate change (black box models). Microorganisms do not exist as isolated entities, but are mixed in high numbers, maintaining a diverse number of social interactions created through adaptation and evolution. Microbial-Light will illuminate black box models via the acquisition of a multi-parametric database. Physicochemical disturbances will be applied to a large combinatorial number of mixed microbial populations of well studied nitrifiers. Microbial growth monitoring at microtiter scale will include strain tracking (FISH-flow cytometry), while function (i.e. nitrification) will be determined at a larger scale. The ample data collected will enable elucidation of functional landscapes for each synthetic community under combining environmental stresses. Additionally, the role of microbial interactions (BSocial tool) across disturbance gradients will be sought. Microbial-Light, will engage in modelling individual growth from synthetic mixed population growth, thereby validating the models with previous experimental evidence. Moreover, the optimal social nitrifying community will be coated on tomato seeds, and plant growth efficiency will be compared with uncoated seeds. Parallel to the acquisition multi-parametric database, evaluation of the nitrification potential of poor and rich soils will be tested coupled with microbial diversity (Illumina sequencing). The analysis of synthetic and natural communities, will allow for a more comprehensive ecological model on nitrification.",0,1
50,201516,Yes,Drought discovery to improve drought tolerance in crops,"Feeding 9 billion people by 2040 in a context of water shortage poses a critical challenge for agricultural practices, particularly under recurrent drought periods. The so-called Blue Revolution -evaluated by UN as an urgent priority- calls to develop innovative solutions to grow staple food crops in water-limited conditions. Increasing temperatures and reduced precipitation have severely impaired crop yields.  Plants can be protected against these stresses by the action of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which orchestrates a multitude of adaptive responses that enhance plant survival. The major class of ABA receptors has been characterized and structural data are available for the receptors of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, in crops that provide more than 50% of the diet worldwide, this knowledge is limited. The goal of DrugCrops is to generate and exploit biochemical and structural data of the ABA receptors in the model crop plant Setaria viridis and in maize to develop novel ABA receptor agonists in order to enhance drought tolerance using small molecules. Towards this translational and multidisciplinary goal, we propose the use of high throughput technologies, X-ray crystallographic, chemical and genetic approaches to dissect the mechanism by which agonists engage and activate their receptors. This information will be leveraged for the design of new chemicals that can be used to control abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants. The ER will work in collaboration with different partner research organizations with recognized expertise in ABA signaling, chemical and structural biology that collectively bring experience ranging from big pharma drug discovery to the genetic engineering of drought tolerant crops. As a result, both the ER and Host could obtain new molecules for plant biotechnology in the field of plant drought tolerance, boosting knowledge-based bioeconomy in the EU and ER´s possibilities to reach a position in research.",1,1
526,90064,No,Atomic-Level Physics of Advanced Materials,"Most of the technological materials have been developed by very expensive and cumbersome trial and error methods. On the other hand, computer based theoretical design of advanced materials is an area where rapid and extensive developments are taking place. Within my group new theoretical tools have now been established which are extremely well suited to the study of complex materials. In this approach basic quantum mechanical theories are used to describe fundamental properties of alloys and compounds. The utilization of such calculations to investigate possible optimizations of certain key properties represents a major departure from the traditional design philosophy. The purpose of my project is to build up a new competence in the field of computer-aided simulations of advanced materials. The main goal will be to achieve a deep understanding of the behaviour of complex metallic systems under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions at the atomic level by studying their electronic, magnetic and atomic structure using the most modern and advanced computational methods. This will enable us to establish a set of materials parameters and composition-structure-property relations that are needed for materials optimization.   The research will be focused on fundamental technological properties related to defects in advanced metallic alloys (high-performance steels, superalloys, and refractory, energy related and geochemical materials) and alloy phases (solid solutions, intermetallic compounds), which will be studied by means of parameter free atomistic simulations combined with continuum modelling. As a first example, we will study the Fe-Cr system, which is of great interest to industry as well as in connection to nuclear waste.

886,97627,No,Evolutionary Conservation of Regulatory Network Controlling Flower Development,"This research exchange programme focuses on plant reproduction. The world population depends for its nutrition on agricultural crop products, mainly as seeds and fruits. Improvements of crop plants to achieve better yields under suboptimal growth conditions will be essential to keep up with the increase in world population and to reduce the impact of high yield farming on the environment. Most agricultural products, such as seeds and fruits, are derived from the reproductive process of flowering plants. Therefore, crop improvement requires a detailed understanding of flower and fruit development. Research on reference species, such as Antirrhinum, Arabidopsis and rice have revealed interconnected regulatory networks based primarily on transcription factors that guide the patterning and growth of flowers and fruits. We will focus on a fundamental, economically important and experimentally tractable biological system, plant reproduction, and we will take advantage of genomic and post-genomic tools to analyse the regulatory network controlling reproductive process. To obtain maximum benefit from a broad comparative analysis, we will focus on a key set of genetic interactions that clearly regulate flower development and cell fate in the reference species. However using a comparative approach, we aim to understand how evolutionary variation led to differences and/or similarities in reproductive processes in (crop) species. Detailed analysis of the network of regulatory genes controlling reproductive development in Arabidopsis represents the biological theme around which our training programme is built. The exchange of researchers between Italy, Spain, Mexico and Brazil will allow an intense collaboration between the research groups that will lead to the transfer of knowledge between the different laboratories. Furthermore, this project will also facilitate a durable network between these countries from which researchers will benefit now and in the future",1,0
131,16871,Yes,Hormonal control of fish growth under different culture conditions.,"The project aims    to identify levels of growth promoting/anabolic and growth-reducing/catabolic hormones in fish subjected to different culture conditions (nutrition, salinity);  to develop recommendations for practical fish culture how to stimulate growth processes and how to minimize growth reducing processes by adequate feeding and culture conditions.   As experimental species, Dicentrarchus labrax, Sparus auratus and Scophthalmus maximus have been selected.  Studies with larval turbots, Scophtalmus maximus evaluated the functional status of organ systems involved in processing exogenous food with respect to survival and growth of early life stages. Intestine, exocrine pancreas and liver are differentiated at hatching or at the onset of exogenous feeding. Enzymes like aminopeptidase are found at the microvillus border. In contrast, evidence that differentiation is finished during metamorphosis is demonstrated for stomach, gills and glucolytic activity of muscles.   The status of the thyroid hormone system was measured. The content of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and the activity of monodeiodinase (MDI) were determined. From hatching until day 50 after hatching about 10 pg/mg body weight of T3 and high activity of MDI were found in the microsomal fraction of the liver.  The influence of salinity and temperature on morphological and physiological changes in Dicentrarchus labrax (D) and Sparus auratus (S) were monitored. Differences in the growth rate for D are found when kept in 1.2% salinity instead of 3.5% at 18 C. The rate was lower in 1.2%, but no difference was found between 2.2 and 3.5% salinity. 28 C accelerated growth when fed ad libitum. The amount of muscle protein was highest when kept under 3.5% and 18 C. Higher temperature was not successful in increasing muscle protein but succeeded in producing higher amounts of muscle glycogen. Generally salinity lower than 3.5% and temperature higher than 18 C had some disadvantages.  Salinity affected the endocrine pancreas and hepatocytes. Transfer of D to 1.2% salinity (33% seawater) increased the diameter of the secretory granules in insulin cells for 24 h and the nuclei and the nucleolar volume of hepatocytes indicating activation of the liver and insulin secretory cells. Acclimation to this salinity caused stress.  Administration of food at 9.00 and 20.00 h revealed the best results regarding growth rate, gain of length and condition factor compared to other food regimes. Four experimental approaches will be in the centre of the project:   The ontogenetic pattern and the role of hormones during the development of larval Scophthalmus maximus and evaluation of rearing conditions in respect to hormonal actions.  Influences of salinity and temperature, endocrine and metabolic changes of Sparus aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax kept under different external salinity and temperature.  Influence of nutrition and diurnal feeding regimes on endoctrine and metabolic profiles of Dicentrarchus labrax and/or Sparus aurata.  Zootechnical studies for practical fish culture.

776,89249,No,Highly Adaptable and Trustworthy Software using Formal Models,"Software systems are central for the infrastructure of modern society. To justify the huge investments such systems need to live for decades.  This requires software which is highly adaptable. Software systems must support a high degree of (spatial) variability to accomodate a range of requirements and operating conditions, and temporal evolvability to allow these parameters to change over time. Current approaches to reusability and maintenance are inadequate to cope with the dynamics and longevity of future software applications and infrastructures, e.g. for e-commerce, e-health and e-government. At the same time, we rely increasingly on systems that provide a high degree of trustworthiness.  Thus, the major challenge facing software construction in the next decades is high adaptability combined with trustworthiness.  A severe limitation of current development practices is the missing rigour of models and property specifications. Without a formal notation of distributed, component-based systems it is impossible to achieve automation for consistency checking, enforcement of security, generation of trustworthy code, etc.  Furthermore, it does not suffice to simply extend current formal approaches.  We propose to take an empirically successful, yet informal software development paradigm and put it on a formal basis. Specifically, we will turn software product family (SWPF) development into a rigorous approach.  The technical core of the project is an Abstract Behavioural Specification language which will allow precise description of SWPF features and components and their instances.  The main project outcome is a methodological and tool framework achieving not merely far-reaching automation in maintaining dynamically evolving software, but an unprecedented level of trust while informal processes are replaced with rigorous analyses based on formal semantics.

What makes leaf wax n-alkanes unique is that their stable hydrogen isotope composition (δD) contains information on precipitation and plant water relations. In addition, leaf wax n-alkanes are abundant in leaves, soils, sediments and even the atmosphere and can persist with their δD values over millions of years. With this exceptional combination of properties, leaf wax n-alkanes and their δD values are now being celebrated as the much-needed ecohydrological proxy that provides information on the hydrological cycle and plant water relations across spatial and temporal scales that range from leaves to biomes and from weeks to millions of years. Despite the enormous potential that leaf wax n-alkanes have as ecohydrological proxy for a range of different research areas, the exact type of hydrological information that is recorded in the δD values of leaf wax n-alkanes remains still unclear. This is because critical mechanisms that determine the δD values of leaf wax n-alkanes are not understood. This proposal will perform the experimental work that is now needed to resolve the key mechanisms that determine the δD values leaf wax n-alkanes. These experiments will set the basis to develop a new numerical model that will allow to ultimately test what the exact hydrological signal is that leaf wax n-alkanes record in their δD values: a mere hydrological signal reflecting the amount or origin of precipitation or, a plant-shaped signal indicating plant water relations such as evapotranspiration. Building on this new model, COSIWAX will set out to test the potential that leaf wax n-alkane δD values hold as new ecohydrological proxy for ecology and ecosystem sciences. If successful, COSIWAX will establish with this research leaf wax n-alkanes δD values as a new and innovative ecohydrological proxy that has extensive possible applications in paleoclimatology, ecology, earth system sciences.'",0,0

Land application of OWP results in many environmental and agronomic effects related to increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. SOC provides nutrients for plants, increases the ability of soil to retain nutrients, increases soil porosity and water holding capacity, improve the resistance of soil to erosion. Land application of OWP also has a potential for climate change mitigation through sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C in SOC.

LCA is becoming the default methodological approach at national and EU level whenever industry or authorities are assessing the environmental and societal impacts of new alternative technologies. However, LCA is currently biased due to the lack of consideration of the effects of OWP land application to the soil quality. As a result, the environmental benefits of land application of OWP are systematically underrated compared with other waste management options. The main objective of this project is to develop new and more appropriate assessment methods for the effects of land application of OWP of urban origin. This will be addressed by combining fundamental biogeochemical characterisation of soil organic matter in long-term field experiments with agro-ecosystem modelling to derive parameters to develop a new LCA methodology taking all the environmental effects of OWP application on agricultural land into account. The results of the proposed project are lightly to provide new insight in both the fields of SOC dynamics, agronomic and environmental effects of OWP land application and LCA.",1,1
956,51028,No,INNOVATIVE DEMONSTRATIVE PLANT FOR TITANIUM SCRAP MELTING,"Realization of a demonstration plant using an innovative technology for the melting of titanium scrap and direct casting of shapes such as slabs, blooms, billets, round sections ready to be rolled thanks to their shape and quality. The equipment is able to melt an all-titanium scrap stock by a consumable electrode arc melting innovative process under vacuum. The process produce a single melt ingot highly reducing the energy and labour consumption with respect either to conventional reference technology or to other hi-tech technologies developed in non EU countries under monopolistic regime. The plant will allow a significant energy saving and a lower environmental impact in comparison to the currently used processes by means of : drastic reduction of the sponge quantity in raw material charge; high energy-efficient melting furnace; casting of shapes more 'in progress' in the manufacturing process (avoiding the forging or blooming phase). The expected and labour cost saving is about 30% and the expected pay-back time for the demonstrative plant is ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 years.  1. The project refers to a plant for Titanium ingots and slabs making using an innovative type of furnace : a Skull Melting furnace, using the skull as consumable electrode. A Skull Melting Furnace is a DC electric arc furnace working in vacuum; it is intended for melting and casting of reactive metals like Titanium is. The proposed innovative version of Skull Melting furnace is intended for ingots and slabs production; it does not require a purposely fabricated consumable electrode : in fact it uses as consumable electrode the solidified skull obtained in one of the previous heats, i.e. the solidified metal remained in the crucible after pouring. Before melting starts, the crucible is charged with feeding materials (scraps up to 100%). This technology will avoid the consumption of big quantity of Titanium sponge. 2. In fact Titanium is a metal having some peculiarities, one of them being the unusual system used to extract the metal from its ore. The result of this complex process is spongy material, called Titanium sponge. Titanium sponge must be melted into an ingot of solid metal prior any commercial usage. The traditional way to do this is compact the sponge into a cylindrical electrode by means of high power presses. The electrode is melted twice or more times into a furnace called VAR (Vacuum Arc Re-melting). VAR furnaces can produce only cylindrical ingots : any further working requires the breakdown forging at high temperature of the ingots to produce billets or slabs. Nowadays, most Titanium is produced via VAR using almost exclusively sponge as raw material. In EC countries, no sponge producer is present, while several users of the sponge and the solid metal products are active. 3. The innovative Skull Melting technology is expected to have minor investment cost than EB technology : because of economic risks, directly related to technical risks, the demonstrative plant is foreseen for a production of 500 t/y of final product.",0,0

20,110519,Yes,Ingredients for Food and Beverage industry from a lignocellulosic source,"Obtaining value-added products from agricultural waste is one of the most relevant key objectives to develop a greener bio-based economy and a future sustainable agricultural framework. This is indeed the objective of LIGNOFOOD project: ingredients for food and beverage industry from a lignocellulosic source. LIGNOFOOD project brings together 5 recognized research organisms and 4 bio-technological SMEs to deal with obtaining xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with the greatest prebiotic potential and xylitol from industrial hemp, an ecological resource of lignocellulosic material. Industrial hemp is one of the oldest cultivated plants and responsible of numerous environmental benefits; resistant to pests allowing reduction of agricultural biocides use, positive crop-sequencing effect for other bioenergy crops, and fast crop growth with low husbandry costs. Thus, it is a renewable resource with great potential to obtain ingredients of added value. XOS are non-digestible dietary components that have been recently reported to stimulate growth and/or modify the metabolic activity of beneficial bacteria and improve gut health. On the other hand, xylitol is also of great value because of its low caloric and low glycemic index, and used as sugar substitute. The combination of two production biotechnologies in one integrated process to obtain two products (XOS and xylitol) from a renewable resource is of great interest in terms of cost efficiency and sustainability. Furthermore, the health functionality and safety of the ingredients will be assured, and their addition to food matrices for food product development will be explored according to the sensorial properties and consumer acceptance evaluation to meet the final user/stakeholder preferences and needs. The participating SMEs will be able to exploit the results of these studies for XOS and xylitol commercialization and improve their competitiveness by gaining access to the rapidly growing market of functional foods.",1,1
342,43102,No,Optimised rose bush production chain by innovative integration of plant improvements and automated rose bush harvesting and conditioning,"The European rose production sector is since 1990 in decline due to too high labour costs aggravated by fierce competition from outside Europe including Africa and Asia The working environment in the rose sector is becoming increasingly unacceptable because the repetitive manual harvesting and conditioning work results in permanent severe back injuries among the workforce. To survive, the European SME rose producers must by biological as well as technical means reduce costs, improve rose robustness and automate rose harvesting and conditioning. The European SME rose producers are mostly relatively small firms, many still family-based and using traditional working methods. It is recognised that further, automated mechanisation is needed but mechanisation alone is not enough to reach sufficiently lower cost: biological innovations yielding more robust roses must be integrated as well. Only this integrated approach can reverse the decline of the European rose sector. The innovative part of this research is the integration of innovative bio- and industrial technologies that will improve human working conditions, make the rose plant more robust so it can survive automated harvesting and have longer shelf life, mechanise and automate the plant-to-packaged-rose production intelligently and cost-effectively, and reduce production cost by 20% and increase shelf life from 3 to 5 weeks. implementation of the project results potentially offers the European rose sector substantially lower cost (20%) and longer rose bush shelf life which is crucial for this largely exported product. Estimated benefits Europe-wide are at least 12 million ECU per annum and reversing the decline in the rose sector.",1,0
272,198731,No,Elucidating the role of ultraviolet radiation in melanoma,"Melanoma incidence continues to increase across Europe and compared to other cancers, it disproportionately affects young people, causing a significant loss in life-years in those affected. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the only environmental risk factor in melanoma, but the underlying genetic constitution of the individual also plays an important role. However, our knowledge of the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in melanomagenesis is still very limited and here we will use various cutting-edge technologies to investigate the role of UVR in melanoma initiation and progression. We have developed mouse models of UVR-driven melanoma that closely mimic UVR-driven melanoma in humans and these provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect how different wavelengths and patterns of UVR exposure affect melanomagenesis. We propose a multidisciplinary programme of work to examine how host genetic susceptibility factors and responses such as DNA damage repair and inflammation affect melanoma development and progression following UVR exposure. We will integrate knowledge from our animal experiments with epidemiological, histopathological, clinical, and genetic features of human tumours to improve stratification of human melanoma and thereby assist clinical management of this deadly disease. Our overarching aim is to develop a validated stratification approach to melanoma patients that will assist in the development of effective public health campaigns for individuals at risk across Europe.",0,0
319,80619,No,Novel Magneto-Optical Biosensors for Malaria Diagnosis,"The objective of this proposal is to develop new, fast and effective instrumentation for the diagnosis of malaria by a non-invasive methodology that permits the precise in-vivo analysis of certain specific blood characteristics. It is prompted by the devastating effects of malaria on health and national economies in the third world, the threat to southern European states following climate change. The malarial parasite is known to modify the magnetic properties of red blood in proportion to the degree of infection through conversion of haemoglobin to haemozoin thus changing the magnetic properties.  This proposal will investigate these changed magnetisation states using both the magneto-optical and magneto-thermal interactions of blood as a basis for a potential bio-sensing system for malaria. Currently the most common method of diagnosing malaria is by observation of infected blood using microscopy by trained microscopists. This is time consuming and cannot be accomplished in the field.  The project objectives are two prototype instruments: 1) A portable instrument based on electronic measurement of the magneto-optic response of a blood sample. 2) A completely non-invasive instrument requiring no blood sample and hence avoiding potential cross-infection and HIV issues.  This project will attempt to break new ground in the field of medical diagnosis using magneto-optics and photonics to access information from biological samples that can therefore be interrogated electronically and potentially non-invasively. The use of these techniques is not confined to malaria diagnosis, having wider application for longer-term development in providing a means of interrogating the condition of biological samples where diseased states (cancerous tissues, leukaemia, diabetes) can be identified from fluctuations in magneto-optical or thermal behaviour. A 3-year project is planned involving 7 partners from 5 EU countries.",0,0

During the last years, this potential of ICT has started to be dealt with in a multi-disciplinary way, giving birth to new research communities dealing with governance and policy modelling, modelling and simulation of complex systems, public administration information systems, open governance and social media. However, this potential is to this day non-systematically exploited, as there are significant barriers that hinder the effective exploration, management and distribution of the vast amounts of available public sector data towards the research communities.The main goal of ENGAGE project is the deployment and use of an advanced service infrastructure, incorporating distributed and diverse public sector information resources as well as data curation, semantic annotation and visualisation tools, capable of supporting scientific collaboration and governance-related research from multi-disciplinary scientific communities, while also empowering the deployment of open governmental data towards citizens.

437,222112,No,The role of extra centrosomes on the tumour microenvironment,"The centrosome, an organelle important for cell division, is frequently amplified in cancer, including breast cancer. In this fellowship I propose to investigate how cells with centrosome amplification change the tumour microenvironment (TME) to promote breast cancer development. Recent work has shown that having extra centrosomes drive tumour growth in vivo, indicating that centrosome amplification is not a bystander of cancer, but promotes tumorigenesis. Consistent with a direct role in cancer, we previously demonstrated that centrosome amplification leads to chromosome instability and cell invasion. In addition to the cell autonomous effects of centrosome amplification, our lab has recently found that cells containing extra centrosomes also have non-cell autonomous effects via secretion of proteins that induce a paracrine invasive phenotype in mammary organoids. We also found that cells with pancreatic cancer cells with extra centrosomes secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that induce activation of the fibroblast-like pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Moreover, using xenograft immunocompetent mouse models, we found that induction of centrosome amplification in SUM225 human breast cancer cells leads to a strong innate immune infiltration (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils) surrounding the tumours. Guided by our preliminary data we hypothesise that altered secretion in cells with centrosome amplification changes the TME. Currently there is no published link between centrosome amplification and TME. I aim to characterise TME changes induced by centrosome amplification in vivo and to identify factors secreted by cells with extra centrosomes responsible for such changes. This work will be the first in-depth characterisation of TME in tumours containing extra centrosomes. Importantly, this project will start an exciting and novel research avenue bridging the centrosome and the TME fields.",0,0
333,221871,No,Understanding and leveraging ‘moments of change’ for pro-environmental behaviour shifts,"Responding to climate change requires profound changes to individual behaviour. However, much of our behaviour is habitual, which is resistant to change. Habits are cued by stable contexts (i.e., same time, place and/or social group), so when these change, habits are disrupted, providing an opportunity to intervene to foster pro-environmental behaviour. ‘Moments of change’ are when individual life circumstances shift within a short time frame, and include biographical and exogenous changes (e.g., becoming a parent, travel disruption). The relationship between moments of change and environmental impact is complex, with heterogeneity between individuals, cultures and behaviours. The aim of this proposal is to examine how ambitious lifestyle change might be achieved through understanding and harnessing ‘moments of change’ in life circumstances. This project integrates insights from several fields (developmental and environmental psychology, sociology, science & technology studies) to bring a much-needed focus on the temporal and socio-technical dimensions of pro-environmental behaviour (change). There are two objectives for the research: (a) To explore and track moments of pro-environmental behaviour change across cultures and life-course; and (b) To examine the efficacy of behavioural interventions targeted to moments of change. Three work packages address these objectives through an ambitious programme of cross-cultural research using secondary and big data analyses, longitudinal qualitative interviews and panel surveys to explore moments of change, and experimental studies to test behaviour change interventions targeted at moments of change (e.g., starting university, retiring, relocating). This project promises a step-change in understanding the dynamics of pro-environmental change across the life course and cultures, and the development of robust habit-disrupting interventions to foster lifestyle change.",0,0

The research proposes a conception of translation as a self-reflexive transformational practice, investigating at the same time importance and effectiveness of translation in the contemporary European political and cultural context. The interdisciplinary character of the project requires a combination of philosophy, translation studies, cultural theory and political theory. The research aims to have a broad impact and takes into account the practical effectiveness of its main ideas for addressing some of the current social and political issues in Europe.

702,90925,No,Molecular characterization and targeted elimination of metastatic pancreatic cancer stem cells,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the deadliest solid cancer and currently the fourth most frequent cause for cancer related deaths. Over the past decades, there has hardly been any substantial therapeutic progress regarding clinical endpoints. New hope has now been generated by the re-emerging cancer stem cell (CSC) concept. We have identified and characterized pancreatic CSC in the context of tumour growth, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. To eventually be able to develop a targeted therapy for eliminating CSCs as the root of the tumour, we will perform comparative functional and genomic analyses of the identified, highly purified human CSC populations, their more differentiated progenies, normal tissue resident stem cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. For these analyses, we are also focusing on their demonstrated resistance of CSC to chemotherapy as well as their invasive properties and tumour-initiating capacity as demonstrated in our orthotopic mouse models. Subsequent functional characterization of newly identified genes regarding their biological function for tumour angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis will be carried out. Moreover, it is similarly important to investigate in parallel the origin of CSCs, which may aid us to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent transformation of tissue-resident stem cells. The role of risk factors that have been associated with the development of pancreatic cancer, namely smoking and chronic pancreatitis will be investigated in this context. Together, the above experiments will generate important clues how CSCs circumvent the physiological regulatory elements of stem cell functionality and, even more importantly, how these cells escape the response to standard cancer therapy. Eventually, these new insights may allow us to develop novel targeted and multimodal treatment modalities for the successful elimination of these cells as the previously unrecognized root of the tumour.",0,0
102,216770,Yes,DryGro: Efficient Growth of Crops in Arid Environments (DEGCAE),"DryGro is an agriculture technology company that has developed an innovative new way to grow animal feed crops using very little water. This method uses large, 20m x 200m closed environment growing units to grow a high-protein animal feed crop called lemna, and can replace traditional animal feed staples like soy meal and sunflower cake which are very environmentally damaging.   DryGro growing units have a number of advantages to traditional feed growing. Units are placed above ground, and thus avoid the need to compete with traditional growing methods for use of high quality arable land in the production process. Using this method, animal feed protein can be grown at a market price cheaper than is currently available on the market today. Current testing indicates that this method reduces water consumption per gram of protein by over 99%. DryGro technology increases yield per hectare by around 8x compared to traditional protein ingredients like soy. The market for feed produced by this technology is valued at over $150bn per year.    The key USPs of DryGro's technology are:  1) Ability to grow high-nutrient crops in areas otherwise unsuitable for agriculture; 2) 99% reduction in water consumption; 3) cost reduction of >50% per unit of output and 4) flexibility in choice of location, thus shortening supply chains and reducing costs. This feasibility study seeks to explore the technological and economic viability of expanding operations into three European target markets (Spain, Italy and Greece; selected as they face significant threats regarding aridity/desertification). It is hoped that the Phase 1 feasibility study will select the most suitable 1-2 markets of these countries, and underpin a Phase 2 application to enable DryGro to undertake trials in the target countries.",1,1

The equipment for the granulating/drying phase was designed and assembled on purpose. It is a two-step, continuous-line unit composed of a turbo-agglomerator and a turbo-dryer with a co-axial thermic jacket for indirect heating through a cylindrical reactor wall and a thermic-oil exchanger for air heating.   The selection of a technology for the thermal treatment of aggregates was addressed towards a multi-step rotary kiln. This technology is believed to be the most appropriate for an innovative process, thanks to a higher output allowed by the last generation of rotary kilns, an increased operational reliability and an improved accuracy in process control. The pilot sintering equipment was assembled starting from an existing kiln, to which additions and modifications were applied according to the engineering study. It is a rotary kiln composed of a pre-heating/firing section powered by a natural gas burner, and a cooling/heat-recovery section. Construction industry components having better thermal and sound insulation properties, and improved mechanical characteristics and lifetime can be obtained using new secondary materials, derived from the recycling of industrial wastes (steel industry flue dusts and fly ashes coming from coal or urban wast combustion). These wastes are thermally treated to obtain granular aggregates, completely inert in acid and basic environment.

The present research project proposes to look at the Holy Roman Empire as a microcosm of states and cities interacting in a federal context, and as an untapped source of quantitatively analyzable data, to understand the causal drivers of the economic, social and political transformations that propelled this change.  In particular, the following questions will be analyzed: (1) What determined the spatial expansion of urban and commercial structures in the Middle Ages? (2) What is the role of climatic changes in this context? (3) What is the role of paradigms of power (self-organizing autonomous cities vs. autocratic territorial states) in fostering economic change, and how did this role change over time? (4) What is the role of state capacity in historical development?  To do this, the present research project aims to assemble a novel dataset (from printed and archival sources) encompassing the whole experience of the medieval and early modern world, in order to provide a quantitative, unified view of these developments. These data will be analyzed in a quantitative fashion applying state-of-the-art econometric analysis. The project will contribute to the literature on the institutional determinants of development by expanding the horizon of causal mechanisms of development considered, by considering the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of these effects, and by embedding the analysis in a dataset with unprecedented level of detail and temporal scope.",0,0
615,109030,No,Innovative Modelling to Optimise Control of Childhood Anaemia across Africa,"'Anaemia affects two-third of all preschool-aged children in Africa. Malnutrition, malaria and helminth infections are among the main factors contributing to anaemia in this age group, however their relative contribution across the continent is not well understood. Spatially explicit estimates of anaemia risk are important measures of child morbidity and mortality. The goal of the project is to develop Bayesian geostatistical methodology for very large, non-stationary data and employ it to  (i) determine the relative contribution of malaria, helminth infections and malnutrition on anaemia and severe anaemia burden among pre-school children; (ii) obtain spatially explicit estimates of the risk of anaemia, severe anaemia and number of affected children; (iii) characterize co-endemicity patterns of anaemia, malaria, helminth infection and malnutrition; and (iv) quantify the contribution of severe anaemia to child mortality. This research will contribute novel statistical methodologies in (i) spatial analysis of very large non-stationary geostatistical data, (ii) variable selection within a non-stationary model for very large geostatistical data, (iii) modelling disease co-endemicity from spatially misaligned surveys arising from independent regression models and (iv) meta-analyses of heterogeneous large spatial data by coupling geostatistical with mathematical transmission models. Applications of  geostatistical methodology will help optimising interventions to combat anaemia by generating (i) the first anaemia risk map and number of affected  preschool  children across Africa which will guide efficient allocation of nutrient supplements and fortified foods; (ii) anaemia  co-endemicity maps and estimates of the relative contribution of anaemia risk factors  to design integrated interventions based on local conditions; and (ii) estimates of the anaemia-related mortality across Africa.'",0,0
317,201459,No,"REmineralisation, OPTIcs and Marine partIcle siZE","Remineralisation of the particulate matter that sinks from the surface to the deep ocean is a crucial component of the biological carbon pump, because it ultimately influences the Earth’s climate. Due to the difficulties to observe this process, however, little is known about the variability of mesopelagic (~200-1000 m) remineralisation. REOPTIMIZE aims to improve knowledge of mesopelagic remineralisation by exploiting – for the first time – time-series of optical proxies of particle size and oxygen consumption collected by autonomous robotic platforms (i.e., Bio-Argo floats). These new estimates of remineralisation, acquired at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, will improve our knowledge of the biological carbon pump and ultimately reduce uncertainties in current and future estimates of the ocean carbon budget.   REOPTIMIZE will combine models and field measurements. Field data from the Atlantic Meridional Transect cruises will be firstly exploited to extend current relationships between optical proxies and particle size from the ocean surface to the mesopelagic zone. Then, spectral light backscattering data acquired by a fleet of Bio-Argo floats in under-sampled oceanic areas will be converted to size-revolved carbon biomasses.  These biomass estimates will then be combined with simultaneous oxygen consumption rates and analysed, by means of simple models of particle dynamics, to derive particle disaggregation rates in the mesopelagic. These inter-disciplinary and innovative activities will establish a two-way exchange of knowledge between the Researcher’s and the host institution and to enhance their European and international network of collaborators.

Recently, Xf was introduced into Italy, where it is causing severe damage to olive crops, and in France, where so far it is limited to ornamental plants and some landscape trees. The overall goal of the research program is to assess Xf potential to spread throughout EU territory, while maximizing its impact through a multifactor approach, based on a seamless integration amongst the 29 partners involved. Proposed actions will be complementary to those carried out under the Project POnTE - 635646, thus ensuring an unbroken continuity with currently ongoing efforts. Specific objectives have been outlined following a step-by-step route, from preventing its introduction into pest-free areas to the establishment of successful eradication strategies in infected zones. Preventive measures against Xf will be strengthened by implementing EU certification programs and developing a plan for establishing a EU Clean Plant Network. EU policy makers will be supported through the development of pest risk assessment tools, focused on current outbreaks and forecasting potentially threatened regions. Surveillance will be properly implemented, supporting the development of early detection tools for field use, remote sensing technology and predictive modelling. Critical information on the pathogen biology, epidemiological traits and hosts under threat, will be gathered with the guidance of the American research groups with long-established research. At the same time, the insect-bacteria interactions will be determined, for developing strategic control measures. The final overall objective is a comprehensive integrated management strategy for diseases associated with Xf, applicable both IPM and organic farming systems, to prevent Xf spread, control its economic, environmental/social impact, when an outbreak would occur.",1,0

617,217393,No,The new generation of Automated active Fire Protection Systems,"Our company AGNOSYS GmbH is a small Austrian company founded in 2009 with a staff that develops and sells control systems for preventive fire protection in commercial buildings. Our latest innovation, AFISYS, is a unique software tool that analyses CAD building plans and extracts relevant information about fire protection devices through an algorithm that detects automatically the symbols of actuators. In this way, AFISYS provides a new intuitive visualization tool for the representation of the whole fire control installation, displaying high-level information, i.e. the real-time states of the actuators together with their exact position in 2D floor plans and their detailed technical data. In this way, AFYSOS has a double benefit: (1) it completely changes the work of system integrators, reducing by 95% the installation time of the visualization control system, and (2) it provides a much more efficient system for handling an emergency by the building operator: thanks to the rapid location of a fault in case of incident, the response is shortened by valuable seconds that will help save lives and assets.  With this innovation, we aim at setting a new standard in the area of fire protection and building control technology. Considering the positive market situation (driven by the increasing awareness on fire hazards, the recovery of the construction sector and the rising trend of automation in commercial buildings) AFYSIS will be the key to our growth and expansion towards the European market from 2021 on, multiplying by 5 our revenues within 5 years and implying a return on investment (ROI) of 3.2 by 2024.

THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE BEING THE INTRODUCTION INTO CLASSICAL PLANT BREEDING PROGRAMMES OF UNCONVENTIONAL CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR APPROACHES OF GENETIC TRANSFORMATION.  New techniques of manipulation of the genome of higher plants are being developed and adapted to plants of agronomic importance. In an integrated approach, the following cell biotechnology methods were developed: regeneration systems from single cells to plants; introgression of foreign genetic material via protoplast fusion; isolation of single chromosomes; selection of mutant cell lines and plants; elaboration of direct gene transfer techniques to introduce deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into plant following these manipulations; application of methods developed with a model system (essentially Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) to the crop species Solanum sp, tomato and cereals.  Using these techniques the following results were obtained: regeneration of plants from explants of various crops; production of useful somaclonal variants of tomato and potato; isolation, culture and regeneration from protoplasts (single, wall free cells), especially in the case of barley for which green plantlets have been obtained; production of both symmetric and asymmetric (partial) somatic hybrids, using both chemical fusion and electrofusion. Such methods were used to introduce useful agronomic characters (virus resistance genes in potato) and to develop asymmetric hybrids where only a limited amount of the donor genome is present. Further research involved the direct transfer of genes into protoplasts (DGT) by electroporation and chemical treatment, associated with transient expression study and analysis of the stable integration of the introduced genes. Techniques for the isolation of micronuclei as well as methods for transfer of organelles by microinjection were also perfected.

188,44617,Yes,Effects of atmospheric carbon enrichment of cultivated terrestrial ecosystems: a face experiment on short rotation intensive polar plantation,"The main NAMIC objective is to develop and bring to marketable stage advanced NLP technologies for multilingual news customisation and broadcasting through distributed services. The actual outcome is then the production of: (1) the single software packages- English, Italian and Spanish Language Processors- User and Domain Profile system - Authoring Engine- Cross-Linguistic Linking Engine- Multilingual Hyper-News Engine (2) and the NAMIC integrated prototype, available at the projects end (April 2002). The last project months have been used to evaluate the real impact of the proposed NAMIC technology (the prototype) in the different business environments where it has been installed: ANSA (Italy), EFE (Spain) Premises.  The mechanistic and process-based responses of trees and tree communities to global change, particularly in response to the predicted increase of atmospheric [CO2], will be crucial in determining the ability of woody plantations and natural forests to sequester carbon at the global scale. This in turn will have feedback effects where tree stands may influence climate at a regional and global scale and therefore influence the process of environmental change at these different scales. Despite the key role played by trees and forests within the terrestrial biosphere, we still have very limited information on the total responses of agro-forestry and forest systems to enhanced CO2 because of the complex web of possible interactions. The few studies conducted at the whole-tree and community scale indicate that there will be a marked increase of primary production, but this increment will be mainly allocated into below-ground biomass. However, the proportionality of this response may well depend on nutrients and water availability in the soil and, also, on genotypic characteristics. Another critical point to be clarified concerns the implications of below-ground carbon allocation for long-term carbon storage. The enhanced carbon transfer to the root system may be used mainly to increase root respiration or, otherwise, to permanently augment the amount of root dry matter and the mycorrhizal activity. The water balance of agro-forestry systems is a key process to understand the coupling of the biosphere and atmosphere responses to CO2. The possible effects of changes of stomatal activity and leaf area production on whole-stand transpiration need to be precisely assessed and quantified. The responses of trees and forests to enhanced CO2 will ultimately depend on the interactions connecting the different organisms that compose the complex trophic webs of such systems. A fundamental issue of the research on global change effects on terrestrial biosphere is the need to appropriately design the experiments to be conducted at the community and ecosystem level.  The FACE technology has the great merit of not altering the general microclimate of the test area and allows to conduct the research on impacts of global change truly at the ecosystem level; however, FACE facilities should be combined with adequate forest tree systems in order to avoid such drawbacks as lack of replication, large genetic variability and delayed response of already adult trees. The research we propose is rather unique because we intend to combine a fast growing, agro-forestry ecosystem, capable of elevated biomass production, with a large-scale FACE system, that is not presently available in any country of the European Union. The FACE facility will be located close to a natural CO2 source and will draw scientists from at least five countries of EU to closely cooperate and combine their scientific efforts on the same experimental system.",1,1
927,197862,No,Molecular and structural pharmacology of adiponectin receptor: towards innovative treatments of obesity-related diseases.,"The human kind is witnessing an escalation of obesity-related health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. A recent groundbreaking study revealed adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR) as key targets for treating such obesity-related diseases. Indeed, the modulation of this integral membrane protein by small molecules agonists ameliorates diabetes and prolongs lifespan of genetically obese rodent model. Despite these exciting results and the importance of ADIPOR in human physiology, there is a complete lack of knowledge of ADIPOR mechanisms of action and pharmacology. This is mainly due to the challenges associated with the characterization of membrane protein structure and function. To fill this gap of knowledge and based on my extensive experience in membrane protein biology, I propose here to characterize the the proximal signaling pathways associated with ADIPOR activation as well as the molecular and structural mechanisms of ADIPOR activation. We will develop an innovative integrated strategy combining state-of-the-art molecular and structural pharmacology approaches including 1) molecular analyses of ADIPOR network of interaction using resonance energy transfer measurement in living cells and a proteomic analysis and 2) structural analyses of ADIPOR and signaling complexes using biophysics and X-ray crystallography. Our data will have a major impact on drug discovery for treating obesity-related diseases as it will enable the application of structure-based drug design and in silico screening for the molecular control of ADIPOR activity. The proposed high-risk endeavor of obtaining structural data on these atypical membrane signaling complexes is a new direction both for my career and for the field of adiponectin biology; the exceptionally high gain from these studies fully justifies the risks; the feasibility of this project is supported by my recent success in membrane protein pharmacology, biochemistry, biophysics and crystallography.",0,0

The objectives of this project are to progress significantly in this field. The evolutionary improvements applied to the instruments will allow to get new information about: 1) Biomolecule Microwave Spectroscopy: the topic will develop techniques that have the potential to expand the use of microwave spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool for biomolecule structure (up to 50 heavy atoms) and to provide additional structural characterization when the rotational spectrum is insufficient to unambiguously determine the structure; 2) Atmospheric and astrophysical molecules millimiter-wave spectroscopy: improve the sensitivity of the method by taking full advantage of recent advances in technology and develop an analytical instrument for trace gas analysis; 3) Rotational Spectroscopy Probes of Molecular Dynamics: develop a project that would use rotational spectroscopy to probe chemical reaction dynamics following laser excitation, using the line shape analysis of the dynamic rotational spectrum. All this experience will be later on used to the final set-up molecular beam MW spectrometers combined with laser ablation, electrical discharge and 2D resonance.

Elaboration of extrusion conditions in relation to properties of applied polymers in order to achieve improved productivity and yarn characteristics allows recommendations for the main settings. This knowledge will be a tool for every producer in order to adapt the processing of the new products to their production lines.  By investigation of yarn processing by the institutes, an indication of the range of settings for drawing, texturisation or staple processes is given, which meet the specific polymer needs and foreseen end uses, e.g. as apparel, home, technical or automotive textiles. This has been the basis for transfer and adaptation into industrial production at SMEs. However, regarding the respective results of industrial yarn, textile and carpet production, the achievable quality was not as good as expected and only could be reached with one type of polymer type, so that there is only a limited added value to be foreseen when applying this polymer to production. For some special processes (coarse technical yarn) it was not possible to reach standard quality. This project aims to demonstrate on principle how to produce industrially textile articles, like fabrics and carpets, of better perfommance by processing yarns on existing machinery exhibiting improved properties with respect to tenacity, resilience, abrasion resistance etc. The yarns will be based upon new types of polypropene, which are going to be manufactured by the use of metallocene catalysts. In addition to offering higher quality products made from these materials it is intended to increase productivity by means of producing at higher speeds. Regarding economic objectives being ever present towards lower costs and higher profits it will be possible on the one hand to increase sales due to the higher productivity and on the other hand to increase competitiveness due to the lower production costs and the better quality, which is produced. In order to reach the appropriate technical aims it will be necessary to adjust polymer properties to processing conditions and resulting yarn, fabric and carpet properties, and vice versa. In detail, to start with, tacticity and molecular weight of the metallocene catalysed polypropene will be varied to generate a broad range of different polymers. Processing these polymers to different yarns, extrusion temperature, processing speed (POY process) and yarn count (CF/BCF types, microfibres) will be varied. Yarn processing with respect to drawing, texturizing and production of staple fibres will be investigated by means of variation of e.g. draw ratio, drawing temperature, processing speed etc., as well as, with production of fabrics and carpets processability will be detemmined depending on production speed. Subsequently product properties resulting from these changes in processing conditions will be monitored by appropriate testing methods in order to indicate, firstly, the achievable improvements of physical textile properties, and, secondly, to indicate a range for those relevant settings, which later on can be used by every producer as a basis to adapt and optimise this new method to manufacture tailor made products to his own production lines. Finally, the overall success of this project will strongly depend on an efficient co operation and a frank communication between the participants throughout the entire project.",0,0
7,224042,Yes,Promoting Circular Economy in the Food Supply Chain,"A projected human population of 10 billion and an increasing consumption of food are placing massive strain on the global agri-food system. Nonetheless, hunger and malnutrition remains a major problem in developing countries. Also, climate change poses also a great threat on food security due to the critical dependence of agri-food production on environmental conditions. Within this context, new strategies are needed in order to maximise the yield of food production systems while minimising wastage and reducing environmental impact. On a global scale, it is estimated that one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally (1.3BN tons per year); even in the EU, despite significant policy efforts, 88MM tons of food are wasted annually, with associated costs estimated at €143BN. This causes waste in production resources (such as land, water, energy and inputs) and avoidable greenhouse gas emissions. Also, food production and consumption produce approximately one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions. All this represents a real threat to the security and sustainability of food supply chains. In the context of agri-food supply chains, Circular Economy provides very promising perspectives on tackling mentioned challenges related to food security and efficient resource use; however, barriers to the implementation of this alternative paradigm are significant. This project is predominantly focused on the identification and sharing of best practices for the implementation of Circular Economy in the food supply chain amongst a wide variety of stakeholders (including research institutions, big retailers, small production and distribution co-operatives).

757,8255,No,Investigation of Optical Probe Techniques for Interface Characterisation,"In the foreseeable future most microelectronic semiconductor materials for IT devices will be produced by thin-film growth techniques under vacuum conditions and from gas, liquid and solid processes. Perfecting the thin-layer interface is very important in making possible higher quality device performance.  This Action has developed a new field of surface and interface characterisation called 'epioptics'. This has submonolayer resolution and is accurate enough to distinguish single atomic layers of crystals. Epioptics, using light as both probe and signal, enables growth to be characterised in situ and, uniquely, in all growth environments. New techniques for determining the properties of materials used in information technology devices have been developed. Light is used both as a probe and a signal (epioptics) and extremely high resolution can be obtained. In contrast to existing techniques, epioptics can be used in situ, while growing the crystals, in all the environments employed for this purpose. Applying epioptics to various processes provides new insights into the growth mechanisms involved, thus increasing yield and quality.  The project has shown that light can indeed be used to characterize surface and interface structure, with submonolayer resolution, due to advances in instrumental design, symmetry rules which forbid bulk response, and the discovery of strong, resonant surface contributions at particular wavelengths of light. Carefully chosen systems, which have been thoroughly characterized by conventional surface probes, have been used to establish the credibility of the new techniques from both an experimental and theoretical viewpoint.  Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) has been shown to be the most promising all optical technique for real time growth monitoring on commercial reactors. At the end of the project the growth of indium arsenic on gallium arsenic in an molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth reactor was monitored layer by layer, in situ, in real time. An additional spin off from the project was that RAS was show to provide a quick and easy method for checking silicon wafer orientation. APPROACH AND METHODS  Epitaxial layers, including As, Ga, GaAs and Sb were grown on silicon substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and As and GaAs by photo-enhanced metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (photo-MOVPE). The material was extensively characterised using conventional techniques. A number of purely optical techniques providing complementary information were then used to investigate and characterise the surface and interface of the material with submonolayer resolution in situ. The techniques used were polarisation-dependent reflectivity (spectroscopic ellipsometry, reflection difference spectroscopy and reflection anisotropy), Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence and optical second harmonic generation.  A strong cooperative theoretical effort underpinned the experimental work.  The Action involved experts in the field of epitaxial growth, materials characterisation by optical techniques, and the theory of the optical response of interfaces.  PROGRESS AND RESULTS  This Action has shown that light can indeed be used to characterise surface and interface structure, with sub-monolayer resolution, due to advances in instrumental design, symmetry rules which forbid bulk response, and the discovery of strong, resonant surface contributions at particular wavelengths of light. Carefully chosen systems, which have been thoroughly characterised by conventional surface probes, have been used to establish the credibility of the new techniques from both an experimental and theoretical viewpoint.  Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) has been shown to be the most promising all-optical technique for real-time growth monitorig on commercial reactors. At the end of the Action the growth of InAs on GaAs(100) in an MBE growth reactor was monitored layer-by-layer, in situ, in real time. An additional spin-off from the Action was that RAS was shown to provide a quick and easy method for checking Si wafer orientation (Siemens-TU Berlin joint patent P4127704.4).  POTENTIAL  This Action has demonstrated the feasibility of using optical probes to monitor growth of thin-film IT materials with submonolayer resolution in situ and under all growth conditions. Implementation of these new characterisation techniques should result inimproved materials and higher yields for the fabrication of future IT semiconductor devices.",0,0

726,200743,No,Understanding the Complexity of Modern Financial Systems,"The modern financial system has undergone immense transformation in recent years and is far more complex than ever before. In lockstep, financial regulation has also become more complex. This research proposal attempts to improve our understanding of potential drivers of this complexity and the implications of this change on the allocation of resources.  Taking a positive rather than a normative approach, I will analyse post-crisis changes at both the micro- and at the macro-levels to create a broader understanding of complexities in the current financial system. In order to do so, I will employ a set of advanced research designs, as well as a uniquely assembled micro-level dataset covering state and privately owned financial institutions in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe.   This project will focus on two interconnected areas of research: 1) Organisation of Credit, 2) Financial regulation in a complex environment. The aim of this project is to create a sustainable framework for the study of post-crisis financial systems, and to shape the current debate on the future of post-crisis financial structures and the development of policy in this area. Not only will this research have a considerable impact on our understanding of financial systems, it will also impact fields beyond finance, like Organisational Economics, Industrial Organisation and Development Economics.",0,0
109,214743,Yes,Transition towards a more carbon and nutrient efficient agriculture in Europe,"NUTRI2CYCLE will use an integrated approach to enable the transition from the current (suboptimal) nutrient household in European agriculture to the next-generation of agronomic practices, characterized by an improved upcycling of nutrients and organic carbon.   The project is deeply rooted in pevious national and European projects, in which the consortium members were actively involved. The underlying principle is that Nutrient Use Efficency can be significantly improved by integrating on-farm techniques and systems that allow better reconnection between 1) animal husbandry provided flows and 2) plant production requirements. At the same time this reconnection itself will serve a better C-return to soil and GHG-reduction by avoided emissions optionally combined with energy production for self-consumption on-farm.  NUTRI2CYCLE aims to (i) benchmark mass flows of nutrients, organic carbon and GHG-footprint, (ii) provide an assessment frame (toolbox) for evaluating potential impact of proposed innovations, (iii) actively support concepts, techniques and scenarios put forward in EIP-Operational Groups, (iv) optimize these (\ in-consortium developed) scenarios using the toolbox, (v) showcase the most promising developments via prototypes and demos. Finally, using the experience gained at a local/regional scale, NUTRI2CYCLE will elaborate strategic scenarios to identify the effect of these innovations at European scale.   NUTRI2CYCLE brings together the extensive expertise of leading experts in the field of nutrient cycling. This collaboration originates from the EIP-Focus Group on Nutrient Recycling, closely interacting with the EIP Operational Groups in the individual EU member states. Better nutrient stewardship engaging all actors across the value chain as envisaged in NUTRI2CYCLE will increase the C, N and P recycling rate significantly and will improve the overall sustainability and innovation capacity of European agricultural systems.",1,1
1048,38616,No,Molecular typing of Cryptosporidium Parvum: Monitoring of Strain Variation in AIDS patients and identification of Transmission Routes,"Cryptosporidiosis is an infectious disease caused by the coccidian parasite Cryptosporidium that primarily infects the gastrointestinal tract of several animal species. In neonatal calves Cryptosporidium infection is characterized by a severe diarrhoea that determines the arrest of growth and eventually the death of the animals. During the 1980s, the number of human cases reported began to rise dramatically. Cryptosporidium is now thought to be one of the most common enteropathogen causing diarrheal illness in humans. Primarily infants, young children and immunodeficient individual are affected. In malnourished children and in immunodeficient patients Cryptosporidium infection causes a severe watery diarrhoea that may be life threatening. The absence of an effective treatment for Cryptosporidium highlight the need to understand the mode of transmission of the disease and to design effective prevention measures for reducing the risk of infection in Immunocompromized patients. Recently outbreaks of human infections in UK and USA have been attributed to water contamination by oocyst of animal origin. Although calves and lambs have been particularly suspected to be an important source of human infection, the relative importance of zoonotic and person to person contact in the mode of transmission of Cryptosporidium infection has not been fully established. The proposed concerted action has the objective to implement the following experimental activities: i) the cloning of a parasite gene that can be used as a genetic marker such as the Cryptosporidium oocyst polymorphic genes; ii) the identification of diagnostic RAPD markers; iii) the analysis of the distribution of genetic markers among parasite isolates showing distinct biological properties; and iv) the establishment of C. parvum reference isolate bank. The participant laboratories are already engaged in a fruitful collaborative research effort. The proposed action will both strengthen the existing ties and expand the scope of the interactions. It is anticipated that the results of these studies will contribute significantly to the understanding of Cryptosporidium genetics and epidemiology.",0,0
767,87995,No,Development of Self-lubricating Nanocomposite Coatings impregnated with in-situ formed MoS2 for Tribological Applications,"Use of self-lubricated coatings in dynamic contacting parts of the system not only reduces complexity, weight, and cost to the system, but also improves the performance to a great extent by reducing friction and wear. Unlike liquid lubricants, the release of various toxic and harmful chemicals to the environment can also be avoided. So, a self-lubricated surface with a long lifetime is a promising one to meet future challenges. The most common solid lubricants are graphite and transition metals layered dichalcogenides, among which MoS2/WS2 has a great prominence. In this proposal, electrodeposition of Co-W alloys impregnated with MoS2 and WC nanoparticles will be carried out to form nanocomposite coatings by a low cost electrodeposition process. The idea is to impart high hardness and mechanical strength by WC particles for wear resistance; and self-lubrication property by MoS2 particles to a Co-W matrix. Firstly, unlike ELECTROLYTIC CO-DEPOSITION from suspensions of MoS2 nanoparticles, here, emphasis will be on the in-situ formation of MoS2 particles in the electrical double layer followed by their incorporation into Co-W alloys during electrolytic reduction process. Secondly, R&D efforts will be directed to co-deposit WC particles from suspensions along with MoS2 to make self-lubricated wear-resistant nanocomposite coatings. The detailed mechanistic study of MoS2 nucleation and growth; the surface and structural characterization of the nanocomposite coatings, wear and friction property and corrosion will be investigated to understand the structure property correlation. Thirdly, the electrodeposition of Co-W\WC\IF-MoS2 nanocomposite coatings will be carried out from electrolytic suspensions of WC and IF-MoS2 nanoparticles, and the properties will be compared with the former nanocomposites.  A special attention will be given on the onset of an implementation of this technology into industrial practice.",0,0
301,212215,No,"Re-designing access to CH for a wider participation in preservation, (re)use and management of European culture","The three-year REACH project will establish a Social Platform as a sustainable space for meeting, discussion and collaboration by a wide-ranging network of development bodies, tourism, education, creative industries, cultural heritage professionals, academic experts, arts practitioners, professionals in archives and galleries, associations and interest groups representative of non-professionals and local societies, and policy-makers – all those with a stake in research in the field of culture and CH. The REACH Social Platform’s activities will have a twofold scope:  - Support: to map and provide analysis of research results achieved in previous programmes, to identify  current and emerging research trends, and to offer authoritative new knowledge of the CH field to the European Commission and policy makers;  - Coordination: to offer benefits to its participants, expanding  knowledge of complementary research domains, and of new participatory research methodologies, generating opportunities for cooperation, offering pathways to wider user engagement with research outputs. In the context of radical social changes taking place at global levels, Europe faces a serious challenge: the need for its citizens to live together in peace and mutual respect and to value and enjoy the diversity of cultures, which they bring to their respective societies. The REACH project is based on the proposition that CH plays an important role in contributing to social integration in Europe, and that a fuller and more detailed picture of the range, type and impact of research and participatory research methodologies, current and future, associated with these subjects will further enhance their potential for social good.",0,0
1079,198663,No,Biocontrol of Aflatoxin Contamination Using Atoxigenic Strains from Almond and Pistachio Orchards,"Aflatoxins (AF), the most toxic and carcinogenic compounds among the mycotoxins, are mainly produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. Because these fungi are common soil residents of almond and pistachio orchards, these nuts are one of the main sources of human exposure to AF. The consumption of almond and pistachio has increased in recent years in the European Union (EU) due to their positive effects on the consumers’ health. Spain has the largest area (587.000 ha) under almond cultivation after USA and its pistachio growing-area is exponentially expanding. Contaminated batches of Spanish nuts by AFs have been frequently detected. Application of atoxigenic strains of A. flavus has successfully reduced crop AF-contamination in the USA and Africa. This biological control strategy uses endemic atoxigenic A. flavus strains, considered best adapted, to displace the AF-producing fungi. Unfortunately, EU farmers do not have the benefit of this type of biological control technology since there are not registered atoxigenic strains in this area. The aim of current project is to: i) improve substrate and application methods of atoxigenic A. flavus; ii) select new biological control agents for their patent and future registration in EU and USA; and iii) construct mechanistic models of risk for AF-contamination. The expected results will have a positive impact improving food safety and the environment and securing economic benefits to EU farmers and agri-food industries. In addition, this project supports capacity building, provides the foundation to the fellow in pursuing his independent scientific career and strengthens collaboration with research groups from EU and USA, three small-medium enterprises (SEMs), and a spin-off company.",1,0

638,54763,No,Carbon flows between western and eastern europe (CFEWE),"Several policies and geo-economic conditions will shape the energy & CO2 future of Europe. Under the Kyoto protocol Europe seeks ways to reduce greenhouse (CO2)emissions. Fact that the Eastern part of Europe is well endowed with low carbon energy resources (natural gas, biomass) is an opportunity to do so. In turn, this situation has a major relevance to the developments in industrial transformation in non-EU European countries. What policies would be required to facilitate and foster sustainable development in the whole Europe given these conditions? This is the addressed topic in this project that wants to bring together researchers (It, UK , NL, PL, CZ , RU), public policy makers and stakeholders from industry (energy, forestry) across Europe. It has the form of two workshops. The first workshop will set the stage. The second will discuss elaborated papers that inform on economics investments and carbon flows using scenarios.",0,0
203,227346,No,Exposure to ‘cocktails’ of food additives and chronic disease risk,"Today, our daily diet typically contains dozens of food additives (e.g. colours, emulsifiers, sweeteners: ~350 substances allowed on the EU market). Safety assessment is performed by health agencies to protect consumers against potential adverse effects of each additive, yet such an assessment is only based on current available evidence, i.e., for most additives, only in-vitro/in-vivo toxicological studies and exposure simulations. Meanwhile, the long-term health impact of additives intake and any potential ‘cocktail’ effects remain largely unknown and have become a source of serious concern. Growing evidence link the consumption of ultra-processed foods, containing numerous additives, to adverse health outcomes, in particular our recent results on cancer (Fiolet BMJ 2018). While most additives allowed in the EU are likely to be neutral for health and some may even be beneficial, recent animal and cell-based studies have suggested detrimental effects of several such compounds. In humans, data is lacking. No epidemiological study has ever assessed individual-level exposure to a wide range of food additives and its association with health, hampered by unsuited traditional dietary assessment tools facing the high additive content variability across commercial brands. Hence, a major breakthrough will come from the novel and unique tools I developed with my team, notably within the NutriNet-Santé cohort (n=164,000), collecting precise and repeated data on foods and beverages usually consumed, including names and brands of industrial products. With this unique resource, I propose a project at the forefront of international research to provide answers to a question of major importance for public health. Built as a combination of epidemiological studies and in-vitro/in-vivo experiments, this project will shed light on individual exposure to food additive 'cocktails' in relation to obesity, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and mortality, while depicting underlying mechanisms.",0,0
153,44775,Yes,FOOD & ANIMAL MONITORING EXPERT,"The provision of reliable information on food production methods, food and food products is one of the main consumer demands from agriculture. New costs related to animal welfare and environmental requirements have to be outweighed by improved cost management to maintain farmers' labour income. Hence, the animal production sector asks for improved data collection. Therefore, an intelligent multisensor microsystem for remote data acquisition by telemetry was developed within an EC-project.  All farm animals need to have a tamper proof, unique identification number (EC regulation 92/102). This technology was also applicable for food preservation, which must be monitored during transport and storage, especially with respect to temperature sensitive foods and food products (EC regulations 92/I, 93/43). Also the origin of the branded food products must be guaranteed (92/2081 to 2084).  The R&D element of the FAME has already been completed. FAME was a bi-directional high speed multiple read/write transponder (length 4 cm, diameter 0.5 cm) having its own power source, a small battery with a life of 2 years. Its interface chip allowed the integration of two different sensors (e.g. temperature and acceleration measurement). The chip can be used in different transponders for several applications (passive and active). Data was collected, downloaded into memory, stored, and read together with the identification code, when the transponder was activated by the antenna field of a reader (e.g. after transport or storage providing time information on the product or process). Its micro-processor allowed programmable data collection, recalibration of sensors on site, and encryption of data.  The aim of the project was to validate its application for farm animal disease monitoring, and transfer the technology to monitoring of food products during transport and storage. Two applications were demonstrated:  - monitoring of fish from catch to consumption - monitoring of meat from production to consumption - welfare and oestrus monitoring of sows.  The combined need for small size, low power consumption, long-term stability, noise immunity and biocompatibility was a challenge for the specialists involved. A redesign of the available chip was necessary to cope with recent production technologies and ISO transmission standards. The following programme of work took place  - adaptation and scaling up of the available design, fabrication - pilot implementation, testing, training - demonstration at real scale (fish, meat): installation of equipment on vehicles, production and packaging lines, supermarkets and dispatching centre - technology diffusion through organisation of workshops, production of demonstration video's.",0,1
