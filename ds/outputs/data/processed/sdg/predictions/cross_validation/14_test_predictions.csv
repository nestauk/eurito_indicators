253,212422,Yes,Cleaning Litter by developing and Applying Innovative Methods in european seas,"CLAIM focuses on the development of innovative cleaning technologies and approaches, targeting the prevention and in situ management of visible and invisible marine litter in the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea.  Two innovative technological methods will be developed, a photocatalytic nanocoating device for cleaning microplastics in wastewater treatment plants and a small-scale thermal treatment device for energy recovery from collected litter on board ships and ports. An innovative floating boom for collecting visible litter and a method to measure microlitter on board ships (Ferrybox) will be developed. The proposed cleaning technologies and approaches prevent litter from entering the sea at two main source points, i.e. wastewater treatment plants and river mouths. Effectiveness of developed devices and methods will be demonstrated under real conditions.  Additionally, CLAIM will develop innovative modeling tools to assess the marine visible and invisible plastic pollution at basin and regional scales (Saronikos Gulf, Gulf of Lyon, Ligurian Sea, Gulf of Gabes and Belt Sea). An ecosystems approach will be followed to evaluate the potential benefit from proposed litter cleaning methods to ecosystem services. New business models will be developed to enhance the economic feasibility for upscaling the innovative cleaning technologies, taking into account the existing legal and policy frameworks in the CLAIM countries, as well as acceptance of the new technologies by their end-users and relevant stakeholders. The data and information produced will be made available to policymakers, stakeholders and end-users in a user-friendly format,both meaningful and tailored to each stakeholder group. CLAIM aims at the same time to raise public awareness with respect to having healthy oceans and seas, clean of litter and pollutants, and hence the importance of reducing marine (macro, micro and nano) pollution in European seas and beyond towards restoring marine ecosystems based on a circular economy.",1,1
685,12021,No,CLIMATE-RELATED VARIATIONS IN ICE TRANSPORT THROUGH FRAM STRAIT,"TO UNDERSTAND THE SEASONAL AND INTERSEASONAL VARIATION OF ICE TRANSPORT.   THE SPECIFIC WORK BEING CARRIED OUT IN THIS PROJECT FORMS PART OF A LARGER INTERNATIONAL STUDY THE GREENLAND SEA PROJECT OF THE ARTIC OCEAN SCIENCES BOARD.    THE CONTRACTOR HAS JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARTIC VOYAGE IN THE SUBMARINE HMS 'SUPERB' , DURING WHICH ICE THICKNESS ALONG THE TRACK WITH AN UPWARD-LOOKING SONAR, AND ICE ROUGHNESS CHARACTERISTICS WITH A SIDESCAN SONAR WERE MEASURED. TWO AIRCRAFT COLLABORATED IN THE EXPERIMENT BY FLYING ALONG THE SAME TRACK AS THE SUBMARINE OBTAINING IMAGERY USING SAR ( SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR ) AND PASSIVE MICROWAVE. THE FUNDS REQUESTED ARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING TWO STUDENTS AND A RESEARCH ASSISTANT WHO WILL HELP IN THE EFFICIENT AND RAPID PROCESSING OF THESE DATA. IN ADDITION, A SECOND SUBMARINE EXPEDITION TO THE ARTIC WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN THE SAME SEASON (MAY) OF 1988 USING TWO SUBMARINES, GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE THE ICE THICKNESS CHARACTERISTICS IN TWO SUCCESSIVE YEARS.    THE SUBMARINE DATA GIVE THE ICE THICKNESS DITRIBUTION VERY EXACTLY, BUT ONLY, OF COURSE, ALONG THE SUBMARINE TRACK. NO REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUE GIVES ICE THICKNESS DIRECTLY, BUT WE WILL USE THE SUBMARINE DATA TO CALIBRATE PASSIVE MICROWAVE SENSORS AND THUS OBTAIN THE THICKNESS DISTRIBUTION INDIRECTLY. THE METHOD IS AS FOLLOWS. THE TRACK OF 'SUPERB' WAS COVERED DURING HER VOYAGE BY A P-3 AIRCRAFT OF NASA EQUIPPED WITH PASSIVE MICROWAVE RADIOMETERS OF THE SAME FREQUENCIES AS THE SENSORS USED IN THE SSM/I (SPECIAL SENSOR MICROWAVE IMAGER) ON THE DMSP SATELLITE (SUCCESSOR TO NIMBUS-7). EXISTING ALGORITHMS YIELD TOTAL ICE CONCENTRATION A AND MULTI-YEAR ICE FRACTION F FROM THE BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES PERCEIVED AT THESE FOUR FREQUENCIES. THE AIRCRAFT/SUBMARINE DATA WILL YIELD ICE THICKNESS CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES AT THE SAME FREQUENCIES. IT SHOULD THEREFORE BE POSSIBLE TO ASSOCIATE A MEAN ICE THICKNESS WITH EACH BRIGHTNESS TEMPERARURE AND THUS DRAW UP CALIBRATION CURVES TO DERIVE MEAN ICE THICKNESS OR EVEN THICKNESS DISTRIBUTION FROM A AND F . THIS IS THEN BE APPLIED TO THE SSM/I DATA FROM THE GREENLAND SEA AND FRAM STRAIT AS A WAY OF MEASURING VARIATIONS IN ICE VOLUME OVER LARGE AREAS.    TO CONVERT THESE THICKNESS DISTRIBUTIONS INTO TRANSPORT ESTIMATES WE NEED ICE VELOCITY. WE WILL USE CONCURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY AT HIGH RESOLUTION (LANDSAT AND SPOT) AND LOW RESOLUTION (NOAA AVHRR) AND SUPERIMPOSE SUCCESSIVE IMAGES TO OBTAIN ICE DRIFT VECTORS. USE WILL ALSO MADE OF DATA FROM ARGOS DRIFTING BUOYS (FRENCH,US,NORWEGIAN) AND CURRENT METER STRINGS, NOTABLY THE GERMAN SET OF MOORINGS INSTALLED AT 79 N IN APRIL 1987.",0,0
734,87930,No,Multifunctional Photothermal Gold Nanoarrays for Cellular Manipulation,"Transporting, organizing, attaching, guiding, releasing entities of various dimensions over different scales remain central to the development of high throughput biological devices able to conduct millions of tests in a short period of time.  The proposed project intends to develop a new generation of substrates for cell manipulation based on photothermal processes. Specifically, it focuses on realizing standard and new functions related to tissue engineering and cell transportation by designing a single type of platform. This project aims to implement photothermal gold nanoparticle arrays (PGNAs) to physically manipulate various types of entities, like living cells. Each gold nanodot will play the role of an adhesive spot exposing the RGD peptide, which are separated by nonadhesive regions functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), so that cell-binding sites will exclusively interface the nanoparticle. By irradiating well-defined areas of the PGNAs with a focused laser beam, the fellow hopes to take advantage of the local heating generated by the nanoparticles to prevent cell attachment in these hot areas. This way, it is possible to study and integrate multiple functions in order to deliver one unique dynamic platform able to precisely control both cell adhesion (releasing, patterning, guiding) and cell transportation (via optofluidics) at the PGNA interface.  The “Multi-PGNAs” project may permit to integrate the same nanotechnology for the development of modern applications, while providing innovative methodologies for designing new experiments in cell biology and nanophysics.",0,0
618,48040,No,Experimental surveys for the assessment of juveniles.,"One of the most basic steps in the advice for fishery management is the assessment of the strength of the year classes before they entry the fishery. It seems that the strength of the recruitment of many pelagic species is already established 5 or 6 months after the spawning (Smith 1985). In that sense, if an assessment of those early juveniles could be done at that phase, it could be used to predict, at least in relative terms, the strength of the future recruitment to the fisheries. However the assessment of early juveniles iy is not an easy task due to the fact that many of the juveniles display an epipelagic distribution, remaining in the upper layers of the water and they are commonly found in shallow waters close to coast  The major goal of JUVESU project is to evaluate the possibilities and problems for scientific direct surveying of the spatial distribution and relative abundance of early juveniles (of about 6 months old) of several pelagic species by means of Airborne systems for fish detecting in comparison with the usual shipborne acoustic systems. The radiometric LIDAR (Light I2etecting and Ranging) will be used from an airplane for the detection of juveniles occupying the upper layers of waters, while a concurrent acoustic (Sonar and Echosounding) and fishing survey will expand the surveying to deeper waters and will serve to check for the performance of the LIDAR system regarding the spatial (horizontal and vertical) distribution of juveniles, and providing, at the same time, the identification of the species composition. The experimental surveys will be carried out for two consecutive years at the south of Europe, in the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic coasts of the Iberian Peninsula, where significant recruitment of sardine, anchovy, mackerel and horse mackerel are known to occur.  A second goal of the project will be the study of the role of marine environment and its variation in the spatial distribution of the early juveniles of the different species. To that purpose some simple oceanographic parameters (water temperature, salinity and colour, and pigment concentration) in the upper water layers will be measured at different scales from shipborne instruments (CTD and Fluorometer) to airborne and satellite remote sensors (Daedalus, AVHRR, SeaWiFS), in order to detect shelf processes (up welling) and ocean structures (stratification and fronts) which may determine the spatial distribution of juveniles SeaWiFS), in order to detect shelf processes (upwelling) and ocean structures (stratification and fronts) which may determine the spatial distribution of juveniles.  The simultaneous use of acoustics and Radiometric LIDAR in the South of Europe will serve to check and compare the weakness and robustness of these two technologies to survey the schools of early juveniles of pelagic species. This together with the acquired knowledge on the relationship between distribution and environment will serve to define improved and efficient methods for the assessment of these early juveniles (and thus of recruitment), which may benefit the management of pelagic fisheries.  The goals of the project are completed with a training on the application and processing of the LIDAR system for the scientific surveying of close to surface fish resources, which will be managed by menas of a course on the Lidar techniques and a training stay in USA.  The project is basically structured in two years of field surveys (1998 and 1999) and a third year for final analysis and synthesis with the edition of final report. The surveys will take place for about 12 days of continuous work in August/September 1998 and 1999, with the participation of all the teams involved in the project. The 2 target areas are the Iberian Atlantic coasts from Cape Ortegal to Cape Espichel (from 44°N. to 38°24 N) and the south east part of the Bay of Biscay (mainly South of 46°N. and East of 3 ° W up to coast). The coverage will be made continuously during day and night in order to check for the differences in the availability of the juveniles to the different detector devices, in relation to the variation of vertical distribution of the schools.  The field work is clearly structured according to the disciplines and natural areas or work of participants. Nevertheless a strong standardization by discipline of work for the data acquisition, storage and processing is foreseen in order to come up with parallel and compatible outputs. This will allow the inclusion of all data in a common geographic information system, which would facilitate all subsequent discussions and synthesis work.  The Scientific teams involved in the project, with their major commitments, are: AZTI, Instituto Tecnologico Pesquero y Alimentario (Basque Country, Spain) is the Coordinator of the project. Its major role, apart from the coordination, is the standardization of the exchange data files and the implementation of the Geographic information system GIS. Concerning the direct surveys on juveniles, AZTI will carry out the shipborne hydrographic and fishing surveys in the Bay of Biscay. In addition, AZTI will receive by means of its satellite antenna station the raw data of the images coming from AVHRR and SeaWiFS satellites concerning both the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic coasts of the Iberian peninsula, which will be processed by it self and by IPIMAR. Finally AZTI will coordinate the synthesis on the environment and the Ecology of juveniles. A person of this team will make an stay in USA to acquire the knowledge of the Lidar technologies  IFREMER Institute Francaise pour la Recherche et l'Exploration de la Mer (France) This team will be mainly in charge of the acoustic surveys in the Bay of Biscay (Echointegration and sonar surveying). In addition it will cooperate with the IEO in the comparison and analysis of the relative performance of the different fish sensors in surveying the juveniles distribution and abundance indexes. It will also help in the discussion on the Ecology of juveniles in their environment and in relation to other species.  INTA, the Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aerospacial (Spain), will be in charge of the Airborne surveys carried out in all areas. They will make the Daedalus survey over the agreed tracks in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Atlantic Coasts to characterize the upper layers of seawater in terms of Temperature, turbidity and pigment concentrations. They will install on board the same plane the Daedalus and the Lidar equipment of Subcontractor 1 in order to apply at the sarne time both technologies together. They will help in the standardization of data storage and processing for the airborne surveys. A person of this team will make a stay in USA to acquire the knowledge of the Lidar technologies.  IEO, Instituto Espafiol de Ocenograffa (Spain). It will take care of all research activities concerning the North-western Iberian Atlantic waters. It will carry out all shipborne direct surveying in this area, comprising the Acoustic, fishing and hydrographic surveys. A second major role of this institute is related to the comparison and analysis of the relative performance of the different fish sensors in surveying the juvenile distribution and relative abundance. With the rest of the teams it will help in the synthesis on the ecology of juveniles concerning the environment and in relation with other species.  IPIMAR, Instituto de Investigacao das Pescas e do blar (Portugal) IPIMAR will take care of all research activities concerning the central Iberian Atlantic waters. It will carry out all shipborne direct surveying, comprising the Acoustic and hydrographic surveys in those waters. In addition, they will help AZTI in the processing of the images from AVHRR and SeaWIFS satellites for the Atlantic coasts. A second major role of this institute is related to the production of a Synthesis of the Oceanographic conditions and events occurring during the cruise surveys in August September of each year (Subtask 3.3). Finally it will collaborate with the rest of the teams in the synthesis on the ecology of juveniles concerning the environment and in relation with other species.  The implementation of the Lidar surveys will be organized by AZTI, IEO and IPIMAR by means of a subcontract with an expertise team: the Environmental Research Laboratories (Boulder, Colorado) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States Department of Commerce of USA. The reason for this is that this is the first time this type of surveys are applied in Europe to epipelagic fish resources. The project will finish by October 2000.",1,0
299,91012,No,South East European Research Area for eInfrastructures,"The South-East European eInfrastructure initiatives aim to ensure equal participation of the region in European networking and Grid computing trends. SEEREN initiative has established regional network and SEE-GRID the regional Grid. SEE-LIGHT project is currently establishing dark-fibre backbone in the region, and SEE-GRID-SCI empowering strategic regional user communities in common use of the eInfrastructure. Close collaboration of National Research &amp; Education Networks and National Grid Initiatives in the region was crucial in materialising this vision. The above initiatives have also raised awareness of national ministries for the necessity of local programmes and financial support for eInfrastructures: a number of ministries have contributed to local network funding and regional interconnections, as well as national Grid programmes. SEERA-EI will capitalise on this momentum and link national-level programme managers and provide an open forum for information exchange, in order to enable coordination of national programmes in eInfrastructures, and to set the framework for a common regional agenda. The project will gather and exchange information regarding current programmes and carry out a state-of-the-art analysis; produce set of best practices and guidelines for national eInfrastructure programmes; and identify areas for joint regional activities, ranging from short-term soft actions, mid-term policy-level actions, to preparatory activities for long-term actions. SEERA-EI will reduce fragmentation of national programmes, create a harmonised approach to national-level initiatives in eInfrastructures, ensure local commitment, and pave the way towards common regional vision, strategy and sustainable cooperation which will give the region a common voice on European and international stage and strengthen the ERA as a whole, enabling collaborative high-quality research across a spectrum of scientific fields.",0,0
1030,82378,No,Understanding seabird distribution patterns to design marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs),"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered as a promising management tool under an Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) approach. However, less than 1% of the oceans' surface is currently protected, and most MPAs are small and restricted to coastal areas, thus overlooking wide-ranging marine organisms which are key components of marine trophic webs (top predators) and useful monitoring tools of the anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment. Among these organisms, seabirds are conspicuous and provide an opportunity to study the influence of diverse variables (oceanographic, topographical, anthropogenic) to ultimately build predictive models helping to design and managing pelagic MPAs.  MARIBA will run in coordination with a LIFE project directed to design Important Bird Areas at sea (marine IBAs) in Spain, a first interdisciplinary step to create MPAs accounting for wide-ranging marine organisms. Within the study area, highly threatened seabirds such as the critically endangered Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus require fast conservation action to understand and reduce their threats at sea, and this project is addressed in this way. MARIBA will take advantage of the data available from this LIFE project (remote sensing, surveys at sea) to ascertain which are the main factors influencing seabird distribution, and ultimately to develop predictive models to properly design the marine IBAs.  A novel semi-experimental part of the project will compare seabird distribution between two fishing regimes (trawling moratoria vs. trawlers operating), to ascertain how trawling fisheries influence seabird distribution and, thus, how these activities should be regulated within the IBAs. Also novel for the region will be the consideration of food-availability descriptors at different scales (data on small pelagic fish distribution in parallel with seabird censuses).",1,0
396,100953,No,Two-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for the Exploration of Biomolecular Dynamics,"The paradigm of the structure-function relationship in proteins is outdated. Biological macromolecules and supramolecular assemblies are highly dynamic objects. Evidence that their motions are of utmost importance to their functions is regularly identified. The understanding of the physical chemistry of biological processes at an atomic level has to rely not only on the description of structure but also on the characterization of molecular motions. The investigation of protein motions will be undertaken with a very innovative methodological approach in nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation. In order to widen the ranges of frequencies at which local motions in proteins are probed, we will first use and develop new techniques for a prototype shuttle system for the measurement of relaxation at low fields on a high-field NMR spectrometer. Second, we will develop a novel system: a set of low-field NMR spectrometers designed as accessories for high-field spectrometers. Used in conjunction with the shuttle, this system will offer (i) the sensitivity and resolution (i.e. atomic level information) of a high-field spectrometer (ii) the access to low fields of a relaxometer and (iii) the ability to measure a wide variety of relaxation rates with high accuracy. This system will benefit from the latest technology in homogeneous permanent magnet development to allow a control of spin systems identical to that of a high-resolution probe. This new apparatus will open the way to the use of NMR relaxation at low fields for the refinement of protein motions at an atomic scale. Applications of this novel approach will focus on the bright side of protein dynamics: (i) the largely unexplored dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins, and (ii) domain motions in large proteins. In both cases, we will investigate a series of diverse protein systems with implications in development, cancer and immunity.",0,0
1070,83633,Yes,Plankton dynamics and global change: the North Sea regime shift,"Marine regime shifts can be defined as sudden, large-scale changes in the abundance of species on several trophic levels. It seems that one of the main reasons for regime shifts is that ecosystems respond non-linearly to changes in the environment, so that a gradual environmental change (e.g., temperature increase) may lead to a sudden ecosystem response when some threshold is reached. Regime shifts may have large consequences for fisheries (as documented for the North Pacific) and consequently for the society.  Therefore, understanding of regime shifts is of utmost importance to predict the ecosystem effects of global climate change and research on this topic is strongly encouraged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There is strong evidence th at a regime shift took place in the North Sea around the late-1980s. Recent studies have shown a step-wise change in the abundance of many species belonging to different trophic levels. Although these biological changes have been found related to the atmospheric and hydrographic forcing, the causative mechanisms of interaction between them are not fully understood.  In this project we propose to investigate the North Sea shift by applying non-parametric techniques (able to account for environment thresholds) to the plankton time-series of the North Sea from which the shift was reported. To do so, this proposal establishes collaboration between two top European research centres, the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis at the University of Oslo, which will provide the modelling background, and the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science in Plymouth, which will provide the taxonomic time-series and ecological knowledge, necessary to develop the mathematical modelling. Thus, this project has the potential to clarify how internal ecosystem forces and external environmental forcing interacts to produce regime shifts, which is an extremely important question for marine ecosystems.",1,1
980,109956,No,The biogenesis of tail-anchored membrane proteins: knowledge and exploitation,"Even in the simplest cells, the integration of proteins into a biological membrane is a complex process that is frequently coupled to ribosomal protein synthesis, and requires the coordinated actions of several additional cellular machines. The de novo recapitulation of such a complex process is well beyond the scope of our current technical abilities. Indeed, the techniques that are used to create novel proteoliposomes, for drug delivery, and artificial membranes, for synthetic biology, are extremely crude. A common approach is to mix detergent solubilised proteins with lipids, and then remove the detergent to form proteoliposomes, a process that is inefficient and difficult to control. Another major limitation of this approach is our inability to alter the protein complement of the resulting phospholipid-bilayers once they are formed. It is precisely this issue that our consortium will address, by creating a flexible and ubiquitous platform that is ideally suited to incorporating proteins into preformed liposomes. To achieve this novel and innovative breakthrough in liposome technology, we will harness the unusual ability of tail-anchored proteins to be inserted into pre-existing membranes. This technique will enable the production of customised liposomes that can be tailored to optimise drug delivery, and allow the creation of multifunctional artificial membranes for the newly emerging field of synthetic biology. The overriding ethos of our network is to develop a robust platform for the application and exploitation of tail-anchored membrane proteins based on a framework that develops and enhances fundamental insight and training in this new field of research.",0,0
930,68708,No,Improving laser welding in automated manufacturing,"The Car industry has been constantly improving and expanding its manufacturing and assembly processes in the last two decades. Due to this development the end- products have considerably improved in terms of comfort and safety. These improvements have lead to an increase in sales, but no comparable increase in employment has been yet observed. One reason for this development is that a lot of newer technologies employed in the manufacturing process require more attention and care than previous manufacturing methods. This project will be a RTD project whose key goal is to develop/improve a new, generation of machinery, production equipment and systems for manufacturing. This answers the targeted research action call on machines of the Growth program. The exploitation of the results can be expected as soon as 3 months following the completion of the project period since the results will be used in industrial production.",0,0
887,213875,No,Smart Energy Management System,"Stignergy brings to the market a pioneering Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) based on bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence that intends to disrupt in the field of electrical efficiency and control for industrial consumers (which typically represent in EU more than 68% of all electricity consumed) with a drastic reduction in the demand and consumption of electrical energy, while facilitating the deployment of renewable energies. Its main benefits stem from (1) reducing up to 15% on the electricity costs, (2) decreasing the associated CO2 emissions (1.5%), (3) maximizing the self-consumption of green electrical energy (solar, wind)  locally produced, and (4) contributing to stabilize the electricity distribution networks for providers. To complement these benefits we propose two unprecedented features: (1) an Energy Storage Management module, which will maximize the self-consumption of green sources of energy from a Battery Storage Energy System and (2) a Smart Grid Integration module, which will provide a virtual charge to balance the energy demand/response of electricity providers. The existing control technologies do not include any intelligence to implement an efficiency energy plan, and are mainly focused on centralized tools which are difficult to install and entail high initial investment and labour costs. Besides, no solution enables to predict the peak demand and maximizes the self-consumption of local green electrical energy. To ensure the viability of SEMS we will assess its technical, commercial and financial feasibility and the IPR exploitation, and define our Business Plan so as to achieve the market uptake in the targeted European countries in 2020. SEMS is aligned with the goals of the EU Horizon 2020 WP for Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy and the energy targets for 2030 by helping reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint by smart and sustainable use of electricity, promoting the use of low-cost, low-carbon electricity energy sources.",0,0
562,73238,No,The role of C-type lectins in A. gambiae immunity and vector-Plasmodium interactions,"Anopheles mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium. During its journey in the mosquito the parasite suffers severe losses in numbers due to immune defence mechanisms of the vector. The genome of A. Gambia, the major African vector, has been recently sequenced and is certain to accelerate studies on mosquito innate immunity and vector-parasite interactions. In this context a first pass genomic analysis identified, among others, 7 genes families coding for pattern recognition receptors (PRR), defined as proteins that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns. One such family encodes the C-type lections (Cols) genes as carbohydrate recognition PRR. The CTL gene family in A. Gambia includes 22 members. A preliminary functional analysis of 10 members by Ran knockout in adult susceptible mosquitoes allowed the identification of two genes, CTLMA2 and CTL4, whose individual knockout in a susceptible mosquito strain induces complete penalization of P.berghei (rodent parasite) kookiness, hence, completely blocking parasite transmission. This striking phenotype suggests that these molecules are beneficial for parasite survival and development and, hence, constitute potential targets for blocking Plasmodium transmission in Anopheles. In this proposal we aim to study the role of CTLMA2 and CTL4 in Anopheles immunity. This involves assessing their expression profile in mosquitoes challenged with microbes and Plasmodium, and determining their mode of action by investigating potential interactions with the surface of Plasmodium kookiness, possible associations with other immunity-related proteins and their sugar specificity. Additionally, the remaining CTL genes will be functionally screened by Ran knockout and those showing interesting phenotypes will be subjected to a similar analysis. Results obtained from this study are expected to highlight the role of Cols in Anopheles innate immunity.",0,0
272,188480,No,Exoplanets in Transit and their Atmosphere,"Since the discoveries of giant planets outside our Solar System, over 800 extra-solar planets have been detected and several thousands candidates are awaiting confirmation. They have revolutionized planetary science, by placing our once unique solar system into context. The subset of extrasolar planets that transit their parent star have had most impact on our understanding of their planetary structure and atmospheric physics: they are the only ones for which one can simultaneously measure mass and radius, and therefore infer internal composition. The few that transit a host star bright enough for detailed spectroscopic follow-up provide, in addition, observational information on the composition and physics of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Much interest is now focused on finding and characterizing terrestrial mass planets, ideally in the habitable zone of their host stars. The present ERC project offers a novel method to dramatically improve the precision of both the detection and the characterization of exoplanets. The method makes use of multi-object spectrographs to add spectroscopic resolution on traditional differential photometry. This enables the fine correction of the atmospheric variations that would otherwise hinder ground-based observations. We propose to setup small-size telescopes equipped with a multi-object near-IR spectrograph and observe 800 M dwarfs. This will be the most sensitive survey for Earth-size planets transiting bright nearby stars. It shall yield dozens exo-Earths amenable to atmospheric characterization, including several habitable exo-Earths. To perform their atmospheric characterization, we also propose to apply the technique of differential spectro-photometry with multi-object spectrographs available on large telescopes. Our observations will represent a step forward in transmission spectroscopy and prepare for the identification of bio-markers in exo-Earth atmospheres with the future ELTs.",0,0

The project shall be carried out at European level, involving a range of stakeholders and  efficiently linking the scientific and policy-making communities.Considering the requirement of the diary of the  Groundwater Daughter Directive proposal, which implies that groundwater pollutants and related threshold values should be identified before December 2005 and listed by June 2006, the duration of the project should be 24 months. In that way  the proposed research will contribute to provide research elements that will be indispensable for preparing discussions on  further steps of the future Groundwater Directive.",0,0
972,81664,No,Regional Intellectual Captial - Development and application of a methodology for European regions,"Although current regional RTD policy has focussed heavily on cluster policies, the methodological base for assessing and developing the heterogeneous outcome of these efforts is surprisingly meagre. There is a lack of approaches for capturing and developing intellectual capital - especially intangible structural and relational assets - that lie at the heart of these RTD policy interventions. At the same time, management sciences have seen the development of Intellectual Capital (ICR) as a tool to capture these innovation relevant intangibles on the level of the organisation. RICARDA aims to transfer ICR on the level of regional RTD networks or clusters. It will therefore help improve regional RTD policy by developing and applying an ICR methodology for collaborative research activities in European regions. ICRs will be jointly drafted by regional institutions, cluster managers and specialized research institutions for differing pilot-clusters in each of the participating regions, identifying opportunities f or improving private and public engagement in R&D activities. The potential for establishing an ICR-based policy learning framework within each region will be explored with regional RTD stakeholders. The findings in the four participating regions will be discussed in an international comparison and will finally lead to a refined methodology for the introduction of ICR within regional RTD policies which will be disseminated in various ways. The participating regional institutions in Stockholm (SE), Stuttgart (D), Styria (A) and West Transdanubia (HU) are all actively involved in cluster-development activities. These regions represent a wide spectrum in terms of regional institutional capacities, economic structures, R&D priorities etc. The four participating research institutions are all actively involved in regional RTD policy and/or cluster management.",0,0
822,185671,No,"Theories and Models of the Dark Sector: Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Gravity","Modern cosmology assumes that General Relativity (GR) is the correct description of gravity on large scales. With this assumption and according to current data, the cosmological model needs in addition the existence of a Dark Sector: Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We know very little about the nature of DM and it is yet to be detected experimentally. The simplest form of DE compatible with the data, a cosmological constant, has a value incompatible with our understanding of Quantum Field Theory. Given that the extrapolation of GR to cosmological scales has not been tested it is possible that the inference of the Dark Sector also needs to be revised.  I propose to (i) determine the nature of DM and DE to a level not achieved before, (ii) test gravity on cosmological scales and (iii) test the screening of new gravitational degrees of freedom in the solar system. The first two goals will require the use of my general framework to parameterize field equations [Skordis, PRD 79, 123527 (2008); Baker, Ferreira & Skordis, PRD 87, 024015 (2013)]. My team will use this framework to construct simple models and observations to place limits on their parameters. We will employ the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations from ESA's Planck Surveyor and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We will determine the sensitivity of the CMB lensing to the properties of DM and theories of gravity. To break possible degeneracies these data will be supplemented with large-scale structure data, weak lensing and red-shift space distortions. We will also perform forecasting for ESA's EUCLID mission which will give us a handle on how well we will constrain GR with cosmology in the future. For the final goal (iii) we will employ the method of [Padilla & Saffin, JHEP 1207, 122 (2012)] to construct a perturbative expansion of theories that exhibit screening, inside the screening radius. We will determine the compatibility of such theories with solar system and other strong-field data.",0,0
984,222112,No,The role of extra centrosomes on the tumour microenvironment,"The centrosome, an organelle important for cell division, is frequently amplified in cancer, including breast cancer. In this fellowship I propose to investigate how cells with centrosome amplification change the tumour microenvironment (TME) to promote breast cancer development. Recent work has shown that having extra centrosomes drive tumour growth in vivo, indicating that centrosome amplification is not a bystander of cancer, but promotes tumorigenesis. Consistent with a direct role in cancer, we previously demonstrated that centrosome amplification leads to chromosome instability and cell invasion. In addition to the cell autonomous effects of centrosome amplification, our lab has recently found that cells containing extra centrosomes also have non-cell autonomous effects via secretion of proteins that induce a paracrine invasive phenotype in mammary organoids. We also found that cells with pancreatic cancer cells with extra centrosomes secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that induce activation of the fibroblast-like pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Moreover, using xenograft immunocompetent mouse models, we found that induction of centrosome amplification in SUM225 human breast cancer cells leads to a strong innate immune infiltration (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils) surrounding the tumours. Guided by our preliminary data we hypothesise that altered secretion in cells with centrosome amplification changes the TME. Currently there is no published link between centrosome amplification and TME. I aim to characterise TME changes induced by centrosome amplification in vivo and to identify factors secreted by cells with extra centrosomes responsible for such changes. This work will be the first in-depth characterisation of TME in tumours containing extra centrosomes. Importantly, this project will start an exciting and novel research avenue bridging the centrosome and the TME fields.",0,0
874,104229,No,Innovative tools for the study of high-energy transients,"The most energetic phenomena in the Universe, also display extreme temporal variability. Classical astronomical observing techniques are not enough to study this kind of sources. High time-resolution and multiwavelength observations are needed to comprehend the physics involved. In this project we propose new tools to improve our understanding of these sources. The project will be both scientific and technological: We will study extreme astrophysical phenomena using leading edge multi-wavelength methods while using our experience to develop new instrumentation and techniques to go one step further. Our project will improve our understanding of transients detected by high-energy satellites, paying especial attention to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and magnetars. We will perform multiwavelength modelling based on data from our ongoing observing proposals in major observatories, in radio, millimeter/submillimeter, infrared, and optical. In order to understand the global characteristics of these events we will perform statistical studies with large data samples. For this we will construct specific databases following virtual observatory (VO) protocols: A database with all the published data of GRB afterglows in the millimetre/submillimeter range and another one with optical/nIR spectroscopic observations of GRB afterglows. On the technological side, we will develop software tools for the analysis of data including spectral line fitting and broadband modelling of GRB afterglows. Finally we will explore innovative observing techniques, based on high time-resolution plenoptic photon-counting cameras. Plenoptic cameras have the capacity to collect information not only on the intensity of light arriving to every pixel, but also the direction in which the rays of light arrive. Combined with photon-counting techniques, this technology will allow us to correct the wavefront of the arriving light and provide both high temporal-resolution with high spatial-resolution.",0,0

These sensors will monitor environmental parameters (wind, snow accetion, temperature) as well as electrical ones (load, voltage, faults), communicate real time with DSO's SCADA and data communication backbone, in order to help them pro-actively perform preventive maintenance and increase lines' availability to facilitate Renewables integration. Such sensors will communicate Real Time using Radio or GSM communication (or other IoT protocols), be completely autonomous, low cost, and easy to install.

619,34966,No,ENHANCEMENT OF QUALITY OF FOOD AND RELATED SYSTEMS BY CONTROL OF MOLECULAR MOBILITY,"Most quality changes in food processing and storage, either desired or detrimental, may result from chemical and enzymatic changes, microbial growth, and structural transformations. The key factors controlling these changes, safety, and consumer appeal are composition, temperature, time and water content. Glassy foods are often stable due to restricted molecular mobility while changes occur in the supercooled liquid state above glass transition temperature, Tg. However, very little and controversial data exist on molecular mobility, reaction rates, and microbial growth in concentrated and frozen food systems. In the present work we are concerned with the effects of various types of molecular mobility, i.e., secondary relaxations such as rotation of side chains, glass transition allowing segmental motions, and rotational and translational diffusion on observed changes in food properties and quality. Our project challenge the benefits and applicability of the polymer science theories in improving food quality and safety. The general objectives of the proposed work are : to increase knowledge of various types of molecular mobility in food and related materials and to provide scientific basis for the improvement of food quality and consumer appeal by control of molecular mobility in food processing and storage. A subsidiary objective will be to facilitate the development of non-food products based on renewable biomaterials.  The specific objectives of the proposed work are :  - to determine various types of molecular mobility in amorphous food and related materials at low-water contents and in the frozen, freeze-concentrated state; - to relate observed molecular mobility to the physical state, composition, water content and temperature; - to establish relationships between molecular mobility, physico-chemical properties, and kinetics of physico-chemical changes and; - to identify the extent to which the control of molecular mobility and manipulation of food composition in processing and storage can be used for the enhancement and optimisation of nutritional and overall food quality and consumer appeal.  The project participants address a highly-integrated multidisciplinary approach provided by nine leading European research groups in the area. Some specific work will be subcontracted to further groups in relevant areas. Most partners and subcontractors have previous collaboration and participate in the European ISOPOW (International Symposium on Properties of Water) activities.  To ensure the widest possible dissemination and application of the research throughout Europe, an Industrial Advisory Board with invited industrialists will be established. This IAB will take an active involvement in the technical content, effective management of the project, and arrangement of workshops. It will also contribute to the feedback as to scientific progress and technological potential to the Community services.",0,0
88,88118,Yes,Evolution in island birds: testing patterns and investigating mechanisms,"Species on islands are widely believed to undergo similar evolutionary changes as an adaptation to the island environment, a process referred to as the ‘island syndrome’. These changes affect morphological, reproductive, physiological and behavioural traits such as sexual selection. Evolutionary change on islands is believed to relate to genetic (e.g. bottleneck) and ecological factors (e.g. release from natural enemies such as parasites and predators). However, very few broad-scale tests of these patterns have been conducted and few detailed studies examined the underlying processes. Additionally, previous studies were mostly based on data obtained from the literature, which are typically variable in quality. This is surprising given the central role of islands in ecological and evolutionary theory. Whether an ‘island syndrome’ does exist or not can only be established by demonstrating that a set of traits has arisen independently several times in unrelated taxa and geographically distinct areas. We propose to examine whether there are consistent patterns of adaptation in morphological, reproductive and sexually selected traits of island birds worldwide and to investigate some of the underlying causes. To this end, we will first collect standardised data from museum specimens for islands and nearby mainland areas from around the world consisting of morphological, egg and plumage colour measures. Subsequently, we will investigate in detail some of the underlying processes and consequences of evolutionary change on islands in the Gulf of Guinea using weaver (Aves, Ploceidae) species, for which phylogeographic data is available, on the island of São Tomé and nearby mainland Gabon. Specifically, we will address the interaction between decreased parasite pressure, immunity, intensity of sexual selection and reproductive investment to elucidate some of the constraints and trade-offs that lead to changes on islands.",1,1
814,208635,No,Evolution of the Cochlea and Hearing in Odontocetes,"Toothed whales (Odontoceti) are a spectacular example of evolutionary adaptation, highly specialised apex predators and a key component of modern ocean ecosystems. The key innovation that has facilitated their evolutionary success is echolocation. Research into odontocete hearing has so far been biased towards physiological experiments and auditory pathway identification; quantitative studies on the cochlea are lacking, despite its critical role in audition. I will fill this gap in knowledge of the cochlea in cetaceans by: (1) quantifying differences in the morphology of odontocete cochlea through the application of cutting-edge scanning, visualisation and quantitative analytical techniques (e.g. 3D geometric morphometrics) to gather in depth data of all features of a fully representative  range of odontocete cochlea; (2) testing through statistical analysis whether these differences correlate with, or are driven by, factors such as diet, behaviour or auditory sensitivity; (3) incorporating fossil taxa to pinpoint the timing of the evolution of echolocation; and (4) identifying convergent evolution of specialised high frequency hearing in river dolphins using novel methods for testing and quantifying morphological convergence. This project will create the most comprehensive data set of odontocete inner ear models ever compiled and will mark a major advance in the understanding of cetacean sensory evolution, providing profound insights into how this enigmatic group of marine mammals came to dominate the oceans - making sense of a sixth sense. The data gathered will be made openly available to other researchers.",0,0
353,103054,No,Neural substrates of depth perception: from surfaces to complex 3D forms,"'The ability to retrieve information about three-dimensional (3D) structure in the environment is critical for the recognition of objects and for the execution of actions (e.g., grasping and manipulating objects).  One of the strongest cues to depth and shape is binocular disparity, which results from slightly different images of an object seen by the two separated eyes on the head.  To date, research that has been dedicated to understanding the processing of binocular disparity cues has mainly used simple surfaces and comparatively little is known about how these cues are used to retrieve more complex 3D shapes.  The proposed project will investigate whether the same neural networks implicated in previous studies using simple surfaces underlie the perception of more complex and biologically relevant 3D structures.  The experiments in the project will integrate state-of-the-art fMRI and brain stimulation (rTMS) methods with concurrent behavioural measures of perception in order to link neural activity to perceptual states.  Findings from this project will not only provide novel insights as to the neural concomitants of depth and 3D shape perception from disparity in humans, but will also have implications extending to clinical settings, artificial systems, and entertainment technologies.'",0,0
262,36132,Yes,The implications for fisheries management systems of interactions between farmed and wild caught species,"The project focuses on the demand for fish, and its implications for fishery management. Factors being determinants in the price formation process and the market structure (e.g., own-price and expenditure elasticities) are analysed. Focus will be on multi-species demand interdependencies between farmed and wild caught species. In addition to the key markets of France, Spain and the UK, the aggregated EU market will be analysed. Several North-Sea species are analysed. The supply side of both the farming industry and the marine wild fisheries will be explicitly modelled, and also accounted for in the demand analyses. Furthermore, price simulations and marine policy modelling analysis will be undertaken. STATE OF PROGRESS  As can be seen from Table 1 in 1997 we have started the work with part 1, 2 and 3. Most of the data collection is finished, and the market structure of the key-markets is mapped. The results will be available by the end of February 1998 in the form of three key-market reports (Part 1). Furthermore, the supply side analyses have resulted in two scientific reports, one where we estimate an aggregated Norwegian supply curve (Steen, Asche and Salvanes, 1997), and one productivity study of the Norwegian salmon industry by Tveteras and Heshmati (1997). The dataset for the Scottish salmon farming industry has been collected, and will be analysed in 1998. Work has begun on the development of a bioeconomic model of the North Sea fishery that will be used to determine the management implications of the interactions between the farmed and wild caught species. We started also the work on part 3 in 1997. On the second DEMINT workshop in June, market delineation was one of the main topics that was discussed. So far the work been concentrated on methodology, which recently has resulted in a scientific paper on cointegration and product aggregation methodology written by Asche, Bremnes and Wessells (1997).  The paper 'Market delineation and demand structure' was submitted and published in American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1997, 79: 139-50. Cointegration tests for market delineation and estimation of a dynamic system of demand equations are undertaken for three high-quality products in the EU; Fresh and frozen salmon and crustaceans. The ideas and methodology in this paper form the basic framework for the DEMINT project, only that in the DEMINT project we undertake analyses of a much broader product group.  Finally, the CEMARE team's work has resulted in an article where they implement a so-called goal-programming approach to fishery management on resource allocation in the North Sea fisheries (Mardle, Pascoe, Tamiz and Jones, 1997).

These are described in Table 1.   Table 1 Main parts of the DEMINT project  Demand- or supply side Part Description Tasks involved Status by 31.12.97 Demandside Part 1 Data collection and descriptive analyses Tasks 1.1-3, 5 Nearly completed Supplyside Part 2 Supply side analyses Tasks 2.1-3 Started Demandside Part 3 Market Delineation analyses Tasks 3.1-3, 5 Started Demandside Part 4 Dynamic Demand modelling Tasks 4.1-3, 5 Not started Demand- and Supply combined Part 5 Price and quantity simulations/predictions Task 6 Not started '.........' Part 6 Marine policy implications analysis Task 7 Not started  In the first part we analyse the three key-markets, their industrial structure, their market characteristics etc. A review of the relevant literature that is available on these markets is undertaken. Necessary time series data (e.g., quantity and price) for the individual key species from each market are collected from local domestic statistics as well as from secondary sources (e.g., FAO, OECD and EUROSTAT statistics). The information collected at this stage is being used to produce three key-market reports one for each country, and the first part of the aggregated EU-market report. The species to be analysed are shown in Table 2:  In part 2, we concentrate on the supply side. We estimate aggregated supply models for the Norwegian and the Scottish farmed salmon industries (Sub-tasks 2.1 and 2.2). Furthermore we undertake productivity studies where we try to uncover which factors that have been important in determining the apparently large technological progress within these industries. Finally, we develop a bioeconomic model of the North Sea fishery that will be used to determine the management implications of the interactions between the farmed and wild caught species later in the project.  In Part 3 the objective is to analyse the demand interdependencies between wild caught and cultured species. The result from these analyses will be used to determine which species to consider in the dynamic demand systems (Task 4). More specifically, these analyses will use multivariate co integration techniques to test for price interdependencies between price series for wild caught and cultured species. This also involves the modelling of particular market characteristics such as seasonal variation in prices, structural shifts, etc.  Table 2 Species analysed  Spain France The UK The EU Salmon Salmon Salmon Salmon Cod Cod Cod Cod Halibut (Halibut) Halibut Halibut Whiting Whiting Whiting Whiting Monkfish Monkfish Monkfish Monkfish Hake Hake Hake Tuna Tuna Blue Mussels Blue Mussels Squid Squid Cuttlefish Cuttlefish Octopus Octopus  Spain France The UK The EU  Prawns Prawns  Trout Trout Trout  Saithe (Coal fish, Pollack) Saithe Saithe  Crustaceans (Prawns/Shrimps and Nephrops) Crustaceans (Prawns/Shrimps and Nephrops)  Plaice Plaice Plaice  Sole Sole  Lobster (prices) Lobster Lobster  Haddock Haddock Sardines Sardines Sea bass Sea bass  The objective in Part 4, is to estimate dynamic demand models to analyse the demand interdependencies between wild caught and cultured species. These analyses will use dynamic versions of almost ideal demand systems (AIDS) and single equation dynamic demand models, which estimate own-price, cross-price, and expenditure elasticities. The supply side will be incorporated either in the form of instrumental techniques or explicitly modelled using supply equations from Part 2.  In Part 5 we will use the estimated supply equations for the main cultured and wild caught species in the EU together with the dynamic demand models to simulate potential short and long run developments of production, prices and off-take in the fish markets. Specific scenarios will be explored relating to the impact on interdependent wild and aquaculture species markets of sustained growth in aquaculture production, changes in TACs with respect to selected marine fish species, and variation in imported supplies of wild salmon and other fish.  Finally, we will develop and assess alternative management strategies for both aquaculture and the traditional harvest sector taking into consideration the interactions at the demand level (Part 6).",1,1
63,13491,Yes,LABORATORY AND FIELD RESEARCH ON LONG-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT,"- STUDY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOUR OF RADIONUCLIDES.  - COLLECTION OF DATA NECESSARY FOR MODELING THE RADIONUCLIDES TRANSFERT.  The behaviour of technecium and caesium in the estuary and lagoon environments of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region were investigated. Of particular interest were terrigenous contributions from rivers to the lagoon and the hydrological and sedimentation parameters. Information about sediment deposition rates and redistribution operated by benthic organisms was obtained.  Mechanisms involved in the accumulation of transuranium elements in some compartments of the marine environment have been studied.  Behaviour of technetium and selenium has been evaluated in the marine environment. The research activity undertaken to characterize the estuary and lagoon environments in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, is part of a larger radioecological investigation programme promoted to improve the knowledge of radionuclide dynamics in the natural environment. Here, attention has been pointed mainly at defining terrigenous contributions from rivers to lagoon and the hydrological and sedimentological parameters. The results obtained can be summarised as follows:  the assessed radioactive fall out on the lagoon hinterland was 1 kBq per cubic metre. Within the lagoon similar values were found only in minimum sedimentation areas; lagoon radioactive contamination is attributable to suspended particles carried from hills and mountains by the rivers;  the Tagliamento and Isonzo rivers, that flow directly into the sea, carry terrigenous sediments that are subsequently drawn into the lagoon where also detritus carried by Cormor river and by the litoraneaveneta channel accumulates;  in the eastern portion of the lagoon only a small amount of sediment accumulation is evident;  in superficial water caesium is associated mostly with suspended particles with diameter larger than 1 um. A similar remark is valid for sediments, where maximum correlation exists between caesium and 0-20 um grain size class.  Studies concerned with the behaviour of technetium and selenium in the marine environment have been carried out.

In this project, attention is directed mainly at defining terrigenous contributions from rivers to lagoon and the hydrological and sedimentological parameters. The goal is to provide more precise information about sediment deposition rates and redistribution operated by benthic organisms. The results obtained from the first years of activity lead to the following observations. The assessed radioactive fall out on the lagoon hinterland was 1 kBq per cubic metre; within the lagoon, similar values have been found only in minimum sedimentation areas. Lagoon radioactive contamination is attributable to suspended particles carried from hills and mountains by the rivers. The Tagliamento and Isonzo rivers, that flow directly into the sea, carry terrigenous sediments that are subsequently drawn into the lagoon where also detritus carried by the Cormor river and by the litoranea veneta channel accumulates. In the eastern portion of the lagoon, only a small amount of sediment accumulation is evident. In superficial water, caesium is associated mostly with suspended particles with a diameter larger than 1 aem. A similar remark is valid for sediments, where maximum correlation exists between caesium and 0-20 aem grain size class.  Studies on technetium and selenium behaviour in anoxic sediments showed high affinities of these radioisotopes for particulate matter and weak remobilisation by bioturbation caused by bottom dwelling organisms. Selenium forms were more strongly bound to anoxic sediments than technetium. In tissues and organs of benthic fish technetium accumulation, especially in the muscle, was negligible. Thus technetiuim contamination of fish muscle will not present a hazard for man's health. 1. BEHAVIOUR OF TC AND SE IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT.  2.

One of our core strategic areas of focus has been in the area of pizza vending machines.   Pizza vending machines entered the market over 10 years ago in response to market demand for more hot food vending machine products. However, while existing technology can prepare a tasty pizza in few minutes, the viability of pizza vending machines has been limited because machine designs have so far not been aligned to buyers' critical selection criteria.   Through a combination of innovative product designs and component optimizations, we have developed a solution that matches this market demand. The principle innovations behind ou​r new pizza vending machine, known as MARGHERITA, reduce the overall size and weight of the machine as well as lowering production costs through lean manufacturing techniques. We achieve a 30% reduction in the depth of the machine through component modularization and a significant energy efficiency (\90%) thanks to our control algorithms that optimize the heating and cooling processes. Our close contact and relationship with vending machine distributors indicates that these are the changes they have been waiting for over the past 10 years.   Our new Margherita machine will create €12 million in revenues by 2023, with an estimated 1,000 separate units operating globally. Our innovation benefits a vast value chain of stakeholders, ranging from vending machine operators and distributors to pizza manufacturers to delivery and logistics companies.

372,108062,No,Global immunopeptidome landscape of normal and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected human cells,"MHC class I-associated peptides are presented at the cell surface for scrutiny by CD8\ T lymphocytes and are collectively referred to as the immunopeptidome. The immunopeptidome plays crucial roles in many processes including autoimmunity, cancer immunosurveillance and elimination of pathogen-infected cells. Nevertheless, very little is known about the molecular composition and biogenesis of the immunopeptidome in health and disease. Through a multidisciplinary effort, I will conduct both fundamental and applied immunopeptidomic studies by using cutting-edge technologies in mass spectrometry(MS)-based proteomics. First, I will apply systems-level approaches to investigate the global relationship between the immunopeptidome, the proteome and the degradome in human cells under normal physiological conditions, i.e. in the absence of infection. This will allow us to gain new fundamental insights into the biogenesis of the immunopeptidome and will provide general concepts of how to manipulate MHC I peptide processing and presentation in immunity. Second, applied research will be conducted by mining the immunopeptidome of human cells infected by the life-threatening pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Each year, almost two million people die of tuberculosis (TB) raising the urgent need of a new and more efficient vaccine against TB. In this project, we aim to discover numerous MHC I peptides encoded by Mtb proteins that could be further evaluated as vaccine candidates against TB.

818,82885,No,"Exchange bias in nanostructured materials: Spin structure, interface dirsorder, coupling mechanisms and new materials","The aim of this project is addressing some unresolved issues regarding Exchange Bias (EB) phenomenon, together with the search of new materials. The EB connection to the spin and physical the structure, the role of domain formation, and the magnetization reversal mechanisms will be studied. A key tool will be the study of artificially nanostructured materials, in which sample features sizes are comparable to the characteristic lengths governing the magnetic behaviour of materials. This will allow tailoring some magnetic properties, like magnetic anisotropy or the domain morphologies, making possible to determine their role in the EB mechanisms. An arsenal of state-of-the-art experimental techniques will be used, for instance Kerr effect with rare geometries and Polarized Neutron Reflectometry. Among the new magnetic materials, organic thin films will be prospected. EB phenomenon is very poorly understood despite the huge number of applications in which it is already used, for instance in data storage and sen sor industries. Moreover, EB may play a crucial role in the development of the emerging and promising spin based electronics or spintronics. Therefore, besides its interest from the fundamental point of view, this project has great interest because of the potential practical applications. The outgoing period will be spent at University of California, San Diego, under the supervision of Prof. I.K. Schuller. There, samples will be fabricated, and also their structural and magnetic characterization will be carried out. In the re-integration period at CEA-Saclay (France), under the supervision of Dr. M Viret, the local magnetic structure will be explored using powerful experimental techniques, as neutron scattering and low-temperature Magnetic Force Microscopy. The present project will strengthen European competitiveness in this fields bringing the expertise of Ivan Schuller's group (UCSD) to the measuring capabilities of the CEA-Saclay.",0,0
542,208137,No,Part-up.com - the open competence platform with high social impact,"We are living in the Postnormal Era, where platforms like Uber, eBay, AirBnB are disrupting traditional business models and the nature of work is also rapidly changing as an ever increasing portion of workforce becomes freelancers. The rise of freelancer movement together with new ways of organizing work have dramatically changed the economic landscape. In this new environment the value creation happens in global talent networks, and the potential for disruptive innovations is embedded in the dispersed, decentralized organizations and teams. New challenges resulting from this development require effective tools to enable business environment and the entire society to adapt. As a result, platform thinking is gaining momentum in the innovation management field. Various platforms and especially so called competence platforms are anticipated to dramatically boost the global economy through improved productivity and higher degree of workforce utilization. According to a recent McKinsey’s foresight, online talent platforms can boost the global GDP by USD 2,7 trillion by 2025. And this is exactly the area where Part-up is going to have global impact! In contrast to trading platforms, where a few global vendors have evidently gained huge market capitalization, the competence platform segment is still a battlefield open for emerging solutions. Part-up is one of the most potential challengers to fill the gap and become the global leader in this market.

1072,187830,Yes,Meso and Sub-mesoscale Physico-biogeochemical Dynamics in a Coastal NW Mediterranean Sea: Quantifying and Understanding Ecosystem Structure and Transport,"Shelf and coastal regions are at the interface between continents (impacted by human activities) and the open ocean (the main regulator of our planet’s climate and its biogeochemical cycles). The shelf-sea carbon pump largely relies on lateral transport to remove atmospheric CO2 from the ventilated surface waters and sequester it at depth. A good understanding of the physical transport processes in coastal regions and their impact on the ecosystem dynamics is therefore not only important for future climate predictions but also has a more immediate relevance (e.g., knowledge of local transport is necessary for the creation of marine protected areas, the management of spills, or the mitigation of harmful blooms events, etc.). SeaQUEST will study the horizontal transport and cross-shelf exchange processes including their effect on the biogeochemistry in the coastal zone around the Gulf of Lion (GoL) off the French Mediterranea coast, a highly productive area and important feeding ground for fish, birds, and mammals, both resident and migratory. The main goal of SeaQUEST is to examine the role of the Northern Current as a physical barrier to cross-shelf transport and the effect of its seasonal variability on the local biogeochemistry and plankton dynamics at meso- and sub-mesoscales. This will be achieved through a highly interdisciplinary approach employing a range of methods and data (numerical simulations, in situ and satellite observations). SeaQUEST will provide new insights into the ecosystem functioning and biological-physical interactions in a highly productive and economically important coastal area which is also one of the main tourist destinations worldwide. The results will therefore be of broad relevance to a variety of stakeholders including decision makers and local managers.",1,1
901,213907,No,"Gender, party politics and democracy in Europe: A study of European Parliament's party groups","Given the crucial importance of European Parliament’s party groups to democratic representation in the European Union, it is surprising that there is limited empirical and theoretical understanding that relates to how they conceive of gender, gender hierarchies and gendered relations, or how they seek to address gender inequalities. Nor do we know what the conditions are for increasing a gender equal democracy in the EU in the face of the current political context shaped by political crises. This project aims to provide a systematic analysis of the gendered policies and practices of European party politics. The research comprises a comparative study of the eight European Parliament (EP) party groups and generates empirical findings about the significance of gender in the current party political transformations in Europe.  Further potential lies in the key methodological innovation whereby the proposed project links informal institutions and discourses to affects and emotions, generating research designs with which the persistence of gender inequalities can be analysed more thoroughly than current gender and politics research allows. More nuanced conceptualizations, and theories about inclusive representation, gender justice and democracy at the transnational level, are a likely consequence of adopting an innovative methodological approach where empirical findings inform the theoretical level. Therefore, the project may have a high societal impact as it speaks directly to the current political crises in Europe, and provides an understanding of their gendered underpinnings.  Thus, the key ambition of this research project is: based on a thorough empirical understanding of gender and party politics at the European Parliament to build novel methodologies, concepts and theories about inclusive representation, gender justice and democracy.",0,0
223,185436,Yes,The development of human activities at sea - What legal framework? “For a new Maritime Law”,"'Making the sea more human.' The project focuses on rebuilding the concepts of maritime and ocean law, given the expansion of human activities at sea. The sea is one of our new frontiers. The development of human activities at sea has led to a transformation of the Law of the Sea and Maritime Law. The main purpose of law is to civilize the new activities opened up by technological innovations. But maritime law remains centred on the concept of the ship, and does not take into account the new marine vessels and their workers. The development of illegal activities at sea questions the competence of States and their cooperation. The HUMAN SEA project will provide critical assessment and perspectives on legal framework related to merchant navy globalisation, illegal activities at sea, and offshore activities. It will summarize the current law concerning international maritime labour in the merchant navy; then consider how the fight against illegal activities led to monitoring of marine areas, thanks to new technologies and through the cooperation of states; then bring the look on ways of managing oil and gas offshore platforms and large liners. Future activities, such as living on the sea, will be considered. Technical innovations predict the development of such use, but the legal framework remains to conceive. The final, overarching task, of the project consists in a conceptual synthesis to define the common principles to be applied for a new maritime law that takes into account activities at sea in their human, environmental, economical and technological dimensions. Such an ambitious project calls for expertise in various domains of law, i.e. Social Law, Economic Law and Environmental Law. The development of human activities at sea requires rethinking concepts rooted in the history of maritime navigation and the very notion of ship and sea, for example. How should we view the twenty-first century civilization through the laws of these new activities at sea?'",1,1

Anchor firms are known to be increasingly important to regional development as highly entrepreneurial, multi-national firms restructure and relocate in response to the pressures of globalisation. However, there is currently a substantial gap in our understanding of the reasons for their qualitatively different impacts on different regions, how and why they assist the development of networks and capabilities in regions, and what local policies make particular regions attractive, and influence anchor firms to contribute towards more cohesion and even development. By addressing these questions, the FRIDA project aims to both improve understanding and contribute towards the effectiveness of policy making. The outputs of the project are designed to directly help regional policy-making to better anticipate and respond to economic restructuring by helping create regional governance systems that ensure less developed regions level-up to the most developed regions, rather than more developed regions levelling-down in response to the increasing freedom of movement of capital, production and knowledge. In doing so, the project aims to directly address the main points in the call and improve development throughout Europe in a way that is more sustainable, even and socially cohesive.",0,0

The project has established through its initial trial the requirements for multimedia applications over mobile networks for the specific domain of people with special needs. From this it will base its developments in the interim phase, (services and applications) with a view to future integration with broadband mobile networks such as UMTS. Within ETSI TC Human Factors the project has initiated two new work items concerned with standardisation of text-telephony (a key service for the deaf) and the further analysis of requirements for mobile video telephony. In its interim phase, the project aims to bring a key contribution to UMTS specifications in the standardisation of protocols and services to support the work on human factors. As the standardisation of the UMTS air interface progresses, the results of the project will encourage the exposure of interfaces and services and related QoS requirements needed to support services for special needs. In parallel with this, the role of IN will be demonstrated together with integration of B-ISDN services. Expected Impact Influence on standards for data communications and mobile networking, thus paving the way towards future UMTS implementation.Establish terminal, services and applications that are accessible to, and usable by, all citizens of the EU.Validate networked multimedia applications for people with special needs.  An explanatory note The name of the UMPTIDUMPTI project is derived from an English nursery rhyme about an egg, Humptidumpti:  Humptidumpti sat on a wall, Humptidumpti had a great fall; All the kings horses and all the king's men, couldn't put Humpti together again  This led us to the image below, the smashed egg, representing the fragmented state of mobile services and the problems of providing for special needs (the egg). Putting the egg together is the task of all contributing into the standardisation of UMTS.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Mobile multimedia services for People with Special Needs combining voice, moving pictures, text or other data streams, integration of the users' environment in the personal communications space, control and monitoring at a distance and security. Contribution to the programme The research work of the project is validated through the demonstration of services and applications developed for the disabled and elderly using existing as well as high-speed mobile communications infrastructure. Technical Approach The objectives will be achieved through trials, demonstrating the optimisation to the mobile environment of existing and new applications for special needs and validating their use for a range of impairments. Workshops will be organised throughout the project in order to present results and to obtain feedback from interested communities. The work will build on already existing results, such as IPNSI and proposals made by the MONET project for example. The IBC infrastructure that evolves during the period of the project will enable these results to be extended further, integrating them with advanced mobile services that will appear as UMTS matures. The role of B-ISDN as the core interconnect with the functions of the Intelligent Network supporting access to specialised services is considered to have major influence on the work. In turn, innovative use of services and protocols in wireless mobile networks will generate input into the standardisation of UMTS, focusing on common service specifications and application programming interfaces. A close involvement in the ACTS consensus process will encourage this cycle of development through direct interaction with other projects assuring early validation of their results. Summary of Trial Three series of trials are planned, with mobile communication infrastructure procured through National Hosts and local services. This programme of trialing is continuous throughout the project's duration and includes: an initial phase to remove speculation about the real issues in supporting special needs and based on existing mobile services; an interim phase to incorporate new technologies and services and further develop the cooperation with other projects; and a final phase, expecting to coincide with the commercial deployment of UMTS and enabling the deployment of applications on UMTS platforms, where acceptability, cost benefit and usability are validated. Key Issues Multimedia - the provision of applications containing text, audio and video as well as conversion between these media and representations optimised for special needs; Quality of service - particularly critical in mobile networks, especially when considering interworking with other networks, e.g Internet, ISDN and PSTN; Security - the authentication of called and calling parties by means appropriate to special needs; Interfaces- service specifications in view of eventual integration into UMTS platforms, protocols, especially for data transfer, application programming interface, ergonomics of terminal design; Value-added services- special applications, or assistance provided by third parties, to improve quality of life for special needs.",0,0

Our goal is to develop this totally new, environment-friendly, cost-competitive, scalable, water-based electrical energy storage system from TRL3 to TRL5.  Our objectives are: 1. to establish and extend the potential of BAoBaB to become a reliable and environmentally friendly way of storing (renewable) electricity at kWh-MWh scale for application at user premises or at substation level. 2. to understand and enhance mass transfer in round-trip conversion techniques and hence to improve the energy conversion efficiencies of the BAoBaB system, aiming an efficiency >80% and >10 times higher energy density than in Pumped Hydropower Storage.  3. to validate under accepted utility use conditions an automatically operated BAoBaB system (with corresponding battery management) at a scale of 1 kW power and 7 kWh energy storage. 4.

450,185738,No,"""""Landscape connectivity for Cat species: transcending structures, scales and climates""""","'Anthropogenic pressures drive global biodiversity loss. The loss of landscape connectivity, further exacerbated by climate change, is a key driver of species decline. Hence, it is crucial to identify key elements that ensure landscape connectivity across landscapes and scales. Several challenges in this context include insufficient knowledge of 1) species’ eco-physiology across landscapes and ranges, 2) the mechanisms driving migration pulses, 3) how local-scale processes (animal movements) translate to large-scale and longer-term patterns (species’ distributions and range shifts), and consequently, 4) the spatial scale(s) at which connectivity needs to be maintained to mitigate climate change effects on species. These issues are best addressed through comparative studies across a range of landscapes and climates, using umbrella species requiring large areas. Using lynx species in North America and Europe as models, this project will establish an integrative approach across scales to predict functional connectivity for wild felids, specifically by a) determining eco-physiological thresholds to environmental stressors and mechanisms driving dispersal pulses between peripheral and core populations, b) investigating the influence of climate and habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure and eco-evolution of these species, and c)  identifying how local-scale processes translate into large-scale patterns of connectivity, species’ distribution and range shifts. Ecological and environmental data across continents will be integrated using groundbreaking eco-physiological and landscape genetics tools, and dynamic simulation modelling (using the novel individual-based model RangeShifter). Spanning 3 years under a careful management plan to ensure feasibility of all 3 chapters, this transdisciplinary project will provide valuable insights and conservation guidelines on how to maintain large-scale connectivity for umbrella species across fragmentation and climate scenarios.'""",0,0
376,62888,No,Molecular mechanisms and signification of leafy (lfy) movement,"In Arabidopsis, the meristem identity gene LEAFY (LFY) can exert non-cell autonomous effects during floral development. Genetic chimera have shown that these effects are mediated by the trafficking of LFY protein from cells where its mRNA is expressed to cells where RNA is not detected. In plants, such non-autonomous effects mediated by the intercellular transfer of transcription factors have also been reported for KNOTTED1 (KN1) in maize, and DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO) in snapdragon. However, the mechanism and the significance of these movements remain enigmatic. By using LFY as a paradigm, I propose to develop three lines of experiments to address these questions: 1) I will determine by targeted mutagenesis the cis-determinants for transcription factors movement and retention; 2) investigate the signification of LFY movement in physiological conditions by expressing a movement-deficient LFY mutant mini-gene in a fly background; 3) isolate trans-acting factors of LFY movement by using two novel genetic screens.",0,0
574,17793,No,IDENTIFICATION AND SEPARATION OF PLASTIC IN MIXED WASTE,"An automatic system using fluorescent tracer technology has been developed to enable articles made from different plastics to be identified and sorted. The performance of the system has been exemplified using plastics packaging (bottles and cartons).   The system comprises three components:  - The tracer system. The tracers are fluorescent compounds which emit characteristic fluorescent 'signatures' when illuminated by UV light. The tracers may be used either singly, or - when large numbers of plastics are required to be identified - in binary combinations of two or more tracers. The tracers are incorporated into the plastics either during polymer manufacture or by means of masterbatches which are added during conversion;  - The sensor system. The sensor system comprises a filtered UV light source; a collimator for projecting UV radiation onto the articles to be identified; an optical system for collecting the emitted fluorescent light; dedicated filtering and photomultiplier combinations tuned to detect emissions from specific tracers; and a data processor, which provides signals corresponding to the identified plastics materials to activate a sortation machine; and - The sortation machine. This machine singulates the stream of unidentified articles (e.g. containers) so that the latter traverse the sensor one at a time. When a signal is received from the sensor, an air jet is activated to eject the identified article into the appropriate storage bin.   The main benefits of this system over existing ones are that it is fully automatic, fast, accurate and capable of identifying a large variety of different plastics. A variable voting system ensures that the optimal balance between sorting efficiency and purity of sorted fractions is maintained, even under conditions where the articles are contaminated e.g. by labels on bottles. Unique features are that the system can discriminate between grades of the same polymer, and if required can reject materials (such as plastics containing certain additives) that must be kept out of the sorted streams.   A single lane process can sort at throughputs in excess of 1 tonne/h and at a cost substantially lower than is possible with manual sorting. The tracer system - if adopted by the industry - could therefore provide operators in the waste collection, recycling and disposal chain with significant economic and quality benefits.   The system has the potential to be developed for sorting shredder wastes and coloured plastics. This has significant implications for industry sectors other than packaging, for instance the automobile and electrical/electronics industries. The proposed research is directed at developing of different plastics in mixed waste. The identification of the plastics will be effected by detecting fluorescent emission 'fingerprints' from traces of 'dopants' in the plastics. By using combinations of materials can be positively identified, thus it will be possible to not sort several different generic plastics, but also different grades of them.  The major research tasks are:  - development of a sey of dopants containing combinations of dyes which fluoresce at wavelengths greater than 500 nm and which are compatible with the polymers (polar and non polar)  - development of a low cost detector comprising a robust light source (laser diode or wide band source such as Xenon arc), light collecting system and detector (wavelengths greater than 500 nm)  - signal processing so that combinations of fluorescent emission signals can be used to allow positive identification of the dopants.  - development of sorting mechanism and integration with the detector system.  - proving trial of system using 3D products (bottles etc).  Successful operation of the system will help to increase the amount of plastics materials recovered for recycling from the post user waste stream from the current level of 7% to about 20%. Each 1% increase in the amount of plastics recycled will save the European Community about 150000 tonnes of oil equivalent. These savings will assist European industry to become more competitive in the global market.",0,0

The meta-analysis will be conducted with state-of-the-art statistical analyses such as model selection criteria and structural equation modelling. Our goal is to successfully identify and cope with all the issues related to SPAR, in an effort towards a deeper understanding of this ecological regularity.  The main questions addressed in the project are: Is there a general best-fit model for all types of SPAR? Is there a unique theoretical basis for the SPAR? What is the effect of scale and system configuration on the form of SPARs? Do the parameters of particular models have any biological and ecological meaning? Which is the role of other parameters, besides area, in shaping species diversity, and how do they interfere at various geographical scales? Is there a Small Island Effect, and what is the best method to detect it? How can we use the insights gained by SPAR analyses in conservation biology? Such a synthesis is of premium importance for a proper understanding and, thus, effective conservation and protection of biodiversity at all scales.  The originality of the present proposal relies in the fact that for the first time the aspects related to the SPAR will be studied simultaneously, and not fragmentarily.

NANORESTART is devoted to the development of nanomaterials to ensure long term protection and security of modern/contemporary cultural heritage, taking into account environmental and human risks, feasibility and materials costs. The market for conservation of this heritage is estimated at some €5 billion per year, and could increase by a significant factor in the next years due to the wider use of nanomaterials. The new tools and materials developed will represent a breakthrough in cultural heritage and conservation science and will focus on: (i) tools for controlled cleaning, such as highly-retentive gels for the confinement of enzymes and nanostructured fluids based on green surfactants; (ii) the strengthening and protection of surfaces by using nanocontainers, nanoparticles and supramolecular systems/assemblies; (iii) nanostructured substrates and sensors for enhanced molecules detection; (iv) evaluation of the environmental impact and the development of security measures for long lasting conservation of cultural heritage. Within the project the industrial scalability of the developed materials will be demonstrated. NANORESTART gathers centres of excellence in the field of synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials, world leading chemical Industries and SMEs operating in R&D, and International and European centres for conservation, education and museums.

Marine benthic ciliates, however, are rather poorly known due to a lack of modern treatments and taxonomic expertise. The objectives of this project are: (1) to increase knowledge of local and global species diversity. A faunistic study of benthic ciliates from UK coastal waters will be carried out using classical microscopy and modern molecular methods. The data for selected UK and Chinese species will be compared in order to assess their geographical distributions. (2) To increase understanding of phylogenetic relationships among ciliates and thus help stabilise the Tree of Life. For this, morphogenetic and molecular data for selected taxa will be used in phylogenetic analyses. (3) To develop a web-based guide to the identification of marine benthic ciliates. This will be constructed within a Scratchpad (http:// scratchpads.eu/) which is a tool developed at the NHM that allows for species descriptions to be made available on the web. The present project will extend this functionality by adding an interactive key based around structured descriptive data. New taxa in the correct format will automatically add them to the key without further intervention. Dr Hu is a top-class researcher from China who specialises in marine benthic ciliates. Expertise in this field is increasingly rare in Europe and has led to a lack of understanding of the importance of benthic ciliates in marine microbial ecology and their contribution to species diversity. This project will help to: enhance Dr Hu&apos;s reputation as a leading authority on marine benthic ciliates; increase his network of European contacts; by developing the open-access web-based guide, increase opportunities for European researchers to collaborate with Dr Hu and colleagues; improve his standard of English thus facilitating better communication with potential collaborators in Europe.",0,1

The ease-of-use CryoProduct meets the nutritional requirements of fish larvae. A doubling in growth rate and a 25-30% shortening of the live feed period compared to a diet of the suboptimal live feed diets commonly used at marine hatcheries have been demonstrated (large-scale industrial trial, TRL6). With a well-functioning feeding protocol to be developed in the project period, it is expected that performances of the fish larvae will be even better. It will be put effort on optimizing the cryopreservation protocols to achieve a CryoProduct with even better quality than today for improving the performances of fish juveniles. A bio-security evaluation will be performed, and a screening of microorganisms will be needed for the registration of the CryoProduct. To successfully launch the CryoProduct into the EU market, it will be of major importance to scale up the production, to establish efficient logistic systems, identify end-users needs and to provide a reliable commercialisation plan for the best possible market introduction. As the CryoProduct has outstanding performances compared to today’s alternatives, we expect a market share of 50% of the live feed market on a longer term. This corresponds to a revenue of more than 100 million €. As the market grows 3-4% per year, the market size will double in about 20 years. It is a considerable aquaculture production in the EU. If the product meet the expectations, it will most probably be a major contribution to realize the production potential of marine fish in aquaculture in the EU.

Moreover, they are tangible traces of the movement of goods and peoples and their intermingling. However, their investigation in Central Europe has not been taken up to the same extent as in the Mediterranean area in Archaic and Classical period (600-400 BC), the time when extensive long-distance exchange develops throughout Europe. The AGAME project will focus on the investigation of Greek amphoras through a novel combination of archaeological, historical and archaeometric methods. The objectives of the project are: to study the unpublished Greek amphoras from Central Europe; to compare these amphoras with examples known from north-western Mediterranean area (North Italy/South France); to analyse residual contents of these amphoras through biomolecular archaeology. These objectives will be achieved through archaeological data collection and residue analysis of amphoras from Central Europe and comparative analysis with Mediterranean materials. The outcome of the project will allow: to specify the geographical diffusion and the origin of the Mediterranean alimentary products in Central Europe; to locate the routes of the Mediterranean products from the North Italy and/or South France coasts towards Central Europe, to investigate the means of transport and to identify the commercial and cultural middlemen in this exchange; to single out the primary contents of the amphoras. The principal aim of the project is investigate archaeology of perishable or non-recordable data of European history involving economic, social and alimentary aspects of the period of the first large-scale commercial and cultural contacts between Mediterranean and Continental European worlds, great movements and integration of peoples and present Occidental culture origin.",0,0
872,108821,No,Enhanced material lifing model for rotating welded structures,"'Green and sustainable engines require accurate and well documented material data for safe operation of the engines at optimum efficiency. The SAGE project aims at demonstrating open rotor engines and technologies to reduce fuel consumption, weight and increased efficiency of engine components. Structural integrity and safety of engine critical parts have to be considered with regard to design, manufacturing aspects and in-service maintenance and overhaul.  The engine operating conditions, thermal and mechanical loads, material properties and other influencing parameters are affecting the Approved Life of the component. Extensive analysis, component & engine tests, and inspections during both component manufacturing and in-service have to be performed for verification. In particular, the regulations required for critical parts to fulfil appropriate damage tolerance criteria has to be considered, and the potential for failure from material, manufacturing and service induced anomalies within the Approved Life of the part. This means that the potential existence of various imperfections, defects and flaws in the component are recognized and are due to material issues, component design and manufacturing. This situation can be handled through the incorporation of fracture resistant design, process control and Non-destructive Testing (NDT).  In fabricated components and structures different visual inspection and NDT methods are being used for weld inspection. The quality of the welds will determine the fatigue life of a component. This project will focus on welds made in IN718, both laser welds and TIG welds. Before testing the specimens will be NDT tested (WP2), then high cycle fatigue tested (WP4), creep fatigue tested (WP5), fracture surfaces examined (WP3), statistical analysis performed (WP6) and finally the lifing model developed (WP7). The model will then be put to use by the topic manager for design of green and sustainable engines.'",0,0
437,40034,No,Regional air pollution and climate change in Europe : An integrated analysis,"The goal of this project is to examine key policy questions about the connection between regional air pollution and climate change in Europe. These questions are:   - How will climate change affect the success of policies to control regional air pollution in Europe, and vice versa?   - What is the relative importance and overlapping occurrence of regional air pollution and climate change impacts in Europe?   - What are joint targets and strategies that can effectively reduce both regional air pollution and climate change impacts in Europe?  The instrument for addressing these questions is an integrated modeling framework. This framework consists of parts of two state-of-the-art integrated models covering regional air pollution in Europe (RAINS) and global climate change (IMAGE 2), supplemented by new components. Funding is being requested for application of the framework, not for its development. The framework will be used to develop scenarios which explore the above questions.  These scenarios will cover from 1995 to 2100, with a spatial resolution ranging from the country-scale to grid scale, and will consist of:   (a) Emissions leading to regional air pollution and climate change,  (b) Changes in the atmosphere including the build-up of regional air pollutants and greenhouse gases together with deposition of air pollutants and changes in temperature and precipitation, and  (c) Impacts of climate change and regional air pollution based on exceedances of critical thresholds and an 'environmental balance sheet'.  The environmental balance sheet will compare   (a) estimates of emission abatement costs and  (b) estimated geographic coverage of impacts, for various scenarios.  The proposed study will be unique in its comprehensive treatment of the linkage of these two major problems in Europe, in its simultaneous coupling of scientific and policy aspects of these two problems, and in its use of the 'critical threshold' concept for both regional air pollution and climate change in a single analysis.   The expected results and benefits of this project will be:   1. New quantitative information about the influence of climate change on policies to control regional air pollution in Europe, and vice versa,  2. New quantitative information about the relative importance of these two problems in Europe's future,  3. New insights into joint policies and targets that can deal with both regional air pollution and climate change at the same time.   This new information can significantly improve the factual basis of European environmental policy. Moreover, the project will promote communication between policymakers & experts in two distinct European communities (those mostly concerned with regional air pollution and those with climate change), and encourage broader thinking about European environmental protection.",0,0

Extensive repercussions of HABs on human health, aquatic species, and aquaculture are yearly recorded worldwide and related economic losses can be measured in millions of dollars. Given their impacts, the increasing occurrence of HABs worldwide constitutes a major ecological issue for the coming decades. The proposed research project CHEMICROS (CHEmically-mediated MICRobial Interactions maintained by OStreopsis) aims to investigate the three essential aspects of the microbial control of Ostreopsis blooms: (i) influence on the specialized metabolism, (ii) commitment with toxins degradation, and (iii) potentiality as bio-agents for blooms control. The proposed research will benefit from the training offered by two renowned institutions, the Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (USA, outgoing phase) and the Laboratory of Oceanography of Villefranche-sur-mer (France, incoming phase), whose research activities focus on natural products chemistry and plankton ecology, respectively. A large part of this project relies on the use of cutting-edge techniques in analytical chemistry, for which I will be trained during the outgoing phase. This knowledge will be transferred to the European host by organizing a technical workshop. The multidisciplinary skillset and knowledge developed through the fellowship will help me gain European and international visibility in the field of microbial ecology and will increase my competitiveness and attractiveness for potential collaborations with researchers in academy or industry, as well as with European managers of aquatic environments.

143,95519,Yes,Effective use of ecosystem and biological knowledge in fisheries,"The general aim of the ECOKNOWS project is to improve the use of biological knowledge in fisheries science and management. The lack of appropriate calculus methods and fear of statistical overparameterisation has limited biological reality in fisheries models. This reduces biological credibility perceived by many stakeholders. We solve this technical estimation problem by using up-to date methodology supporting more effective use of data. The models suggested will include important knowledge about biological processes and the applied statistical inference methods allow to integrate and update this knowledge in stock assessment. We will use the basic biological data (such as growth, maturity, fecundity, maximum age and recruitment data sets) to estimate general probabilistic dependencies in fish stock assessments. In particular, we will seek to improve the use of large existing biological and environmental databases, published papers and survey data sets provided by EU data collection regulations and stored by ICES and EU member countries. Bayesian inference will form the methodological backbone of the project and will enable realistic estimations of uncertainty. We develop a computational learning approach that builds on the extensive information present in FishBase (www.fishbase.org).The developed methodology will be of fundamental importance, especially for the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. It has been a difficult challenge even for target species with long data series, and now the same challenge is given for new and poorly studied species. We will improve ways to find generic and understandable biological reference points, such as the required number of spawning times per fish, which also supports the management needs in the developing countries. ECOKNOWS applies decision analysis and bioeconomic methods to evaluate the validity and utility of improved information, helping to plan efficient EU data collection.",1,1
154,227656,Yes,Modeling Prey Isocapes in the North Atlantic for Advancement in Predator Ecology,"The immensity of the oceans makes it difficult to monitor them at a spatio-temporal scale that is relevant for resolving ecological processes and responses to decades of pressure from multiple anthropological stressors. With IsoMod, I aim to map the biogeochemical tracers (stable isotope (SI) composition) at the base of the food web to inform three key measures of marine ecosystem processes that might be affected by these stressors: productivity, food web structure and animal migration pathways. The isoscapes will be developed at the scale of the North Atlantic Ocean and will be based on Calanus spp. carbon and nitrogen SI values, δ13C and δ15N. Lipid rich zooplankton organisms such as C. finmarchicus fuel a large part of the higher trophic level in the North Atlantic, including many species of fish, birds and mammals. I will use a recently developed spatial statistic approach where high resolution observational data (e.g., satellite data) are applied as predictors of SI variability, and apply these models to produce isoscapes with a full coverage of the study area. The application of these isoscapes will be showcased in two case studies. The first will test the role of changes in Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) winter diet in key life-history parameters (e.g., body condition, survival rate). Specifically, the isoscapes will be used to provide the trophic baseline needed to investigate changes in puffin trophic position associated with changes in diet. The second case study will use prey SI to improve forecast of Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) summer distribution. Variation in SI values can be linked to variation in secondary productivity and this will be used to identify best foraging conditions for mackerel ahead of their migration to the summer feeding grounds. This information will be investigated as a driver of mackerel summer distribution and their recent shift in distribution.",1,1
543,206792,No,New innovative textile cutting machine,"'The textile sector is a multi-million industry in Europe (€165 billion turnover, €4 billion investment and over 1.6 million workers in 2014). Clothing alone stands for €75.6 billion turnover, €1.4 billion investment and over 1.0 million workers in 2014, with two separate production areas: 'high volume - low price', and 'low volume'.  These markets all have a distinctive need: the quality of the cut, sewed fabrics and the flexibility for introducing changes and personalisation. They rely on highly skilled artisans, who cut the material by hand to produce top quality material pieces. The problem arises with the current and foreseen disappearance trend of this highly skilled specialisation, coupled to the continued growth in the sector.  Our project delivers a PATENTED single-layer cutting with the accuracy of an expert (\/- 0.1mm) but at the speed of an automatic machine, combined with automatic unloading, stacking and emptying. We have designed and developed a double blade system suitable for all types of fabric without any need for vacuum. Glass planarity and electro-static retention guarantee no tension, deformation or fraying of the fabric. Simplified mechanical components reduce the need for service, leading to significant savings per year on electrical power, consumables and maintenance (63% reduction for CRYSTAL).  This market is about 1,000 cutting machines per year. With our project we intend to reach a market share of 10% (100 machines per year) by 2022. Our intention is to set a selling price for CRYSTAL of €100K for a 35K EUR margin per unit, allowing us to reach a turnover of €10M by 2022 and a net profit of €3.5 million. After €2.27 million total investment, we forecast a Return on Investment (ROI) of 2.74 by Y5.  ​With €700k already invested, we have produced 2 working prototypes, which are being tested by potential clients and proofing our Technology Readiness Level at 6.

236,108874,Yes,Climate effects on the deep-sea ecosystem functioning of the Mediterranean Sea,"Scientific evidence is now overwhelming that climate change is a serious threat to marine ecosystems requiring urgent global response. Warming trends in the atmosphere and in the upper ocean temperatures have occurred and have caused profound changes all over the globe. Recent evidences suggest that the structure and dynamics of deep-sea ecosystems can change radically and deep-sea ecosystem functioning may change in relation to biodiversity. The deep sea responds dynamically to environmental changes. Shifts in upper ocean temperature intensify stratification, reduce vertical mixing and can affect the variability in primary production and carbon export flux to the deep sea. However, while there are close linkages between benthic, pelagic and climatic processes, it is difficult to predict the impact of climate change on deep-sea benthic ecosystems. There is a need to understand how our oceans function, how they are changing and how they may be impacted by climate change so that appropriate management actions can be executed on European seas. The general aim of the present project is to provide a comprehensive insight about the link between climate induced change and deep-sea ecosystems, capitalising on existing research efforts at the Mediterranean Sea. The results of this project will provide the background knowledge for planning of future resource management and define the best strategies for sustainable use of deep-sea resources.",1,1
767,31616,No,Advanced mechatronics technology for turbine blades repair,"Turbine blades are very expensive alloy components produced at high temperatures. Either due to normal wear or accidental damage, turbine blades require repairing. The repair process includes welding of the damaged parts of the blade. Then, the blades are hand finished down to their nominative dimensions.  The continuous increase of the repair market, requires from the companies involved specialised technology in order to reduce the repair cost and to increase productivity.  AMATEUR is aiming at the development of an integrated solution for the finishing phase of the repair process which is the most difficult and critical one.  The technological solutions to these problems lie in the domain of mechatronics. They involve force controlled actuators, 3D data capturing and advanced machine programming.  The project will therefore deal with the development of  - a 3D measurement laser sensor offering an accuracy of 0,02 mm;  - specific software tools for blades modelling and robot off-line programming;  - path planning software for the finishing process;  - process control software for adaptive grinding and milling.  The concept of adaptive finishing through the use of machine tools (including robots), used by AMATEUR, promises to create a breakthrough in the domain of machining. The implementation of this technology in robot grinding and 5-axis milling will ensure the repeatability of the finishing process, the precision of the part dimensions, the improvement of the repair quality as well as reduction of the repair time and cost.",0,0

Especially for the characterisation/inspection of complex geometries or critical featureslocated inside the materials, non destructive imaging technologies are of great advantage. Unfortunately,conventional available non destructive imaging and evaluation methods are either very costly and/or rather slow(e.g X-ray computer tomography) or they do not fulfil the requirements (like standard ultrasonics) for advancedapplications e.g. for high resolution inspection of microparts.This project aims to solve these problems by developing a novel, fast, compact, user-friendly, cost effective(affordable by SMEs) tomographic characterisation tool for industrial applications, based on optical coherencetomography (OCT).

In particular, in the exchange of experience on the usage of ocean acoustics for geophysical exploration, ocean circulation monitoring and underwater acoustic communications. The OAEx programme allows the transfer of knowledge and information between partners in order to improve and complement their individual expertises to be applied in ongoing and perspective projects. More  specifically, European and  Canadian groups have  developed techniques  on ocean environmental monitoring by acoustic sensing and/or using underwater acoustic communications, that could be integrated and applied to monitor the  challenging and strategic site of Cabo Frio in Brazil, long time studied by the Brazilian partners using conventional oceanographic tools. In turn the Brazilian partners will profit from the programme by acquiring expertises in a prospective field that they are just starting. Moreover, the Canadian partner has privileged access to the NEPTUNE observatory, at the moment an unique cabled long term multidisciplinary ocean observation laboratory operating in the global ocean. Since there are plans for creating such a  complex and expensive infrastructures by other major world players, and in particular EU (ESONET network), the OAEx partners will profit from exchanging experiences in order to optimize the exploration and implementation of current and future laboratories.

In order to contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon, we use two model plant genera (Edraianthus, Heliosperma) to address the following objectives within the project: establishment of sound molecular phylogenetic hypotheses on the relationships of the study groups both to its closest relatives as well as within the respective genera; testing the Pleistocene speciation hypothesis; establishment of sound comparative phylogeographic hypotheses within species and species groups; pinpointing the putative centres of origin of the respective groups based on the phylogen etic and phylogeographic pattern; determining the migration paths from the Balkans to the Apennines; determining frequency and timing of the colonisation of the Apennines and pinpointing secondary centres of origin in the Apennines. Material of all species of the study groups will be collected in the field. Research will be carried out applying modern molecular methods [DNA-sequencing, cpDNA haplotype analysis, DNA-fingerprinting (AFLP), molecular dating], cytogenetic analyses, morphometrics, and biogeograp hic analyses. Despite its recognized importance as a diversity hot spot in Europe, the Balkans has only been marginally, if at all, included in such studies.

Unlike liquid lubricants, the release of various toxic and harmful chemicals to the environment can also be avoided. So, a self-lubricated surface with a long lifetime is a promising one to meet future challenges. The most common solid lubricants are graphite and transition metals layered dichalcogenides, among which MoS2/WS2 has a great prominence. In this proposal, electrodeposition of Co-W alloys impregnated with MoS2 and WC nanoparticles will be carried out to form nanocomposite coatings by a low cost electrodeposition process. The idea is to impart high hardness and mechanical strength by WC particles for wear resistance; and self-lubrication property by MoS2 particles to a Co-W matrix. Firstly, unlike ELECTROLYTIC CO-DEPOSITION from suspensions of MoS2 nanoparticles, here, emphasis will be on the in-situ formation of MoS2 particles in the electrical double layer followed by their incorporation into Co-W alloys during electrolytic reduction process. Secondly, R&D efforts will be directed to co-deposit WC particles from suspensions along with MoS2 to make self-lubricated wear-resistant nanocomposite coatings. The detailed mechanistic study of MoS2 nucleation and growth; the surface and structural characterization of the nanocomposite coatings, wear and friction property and corrosion will be investigated to understand the structure property correlation. Thirdly, the electrodeposition of Co-W\WC\IF-MoS2 nanocomposite coatings will be carried out from electrolytic suspensions of WC and IF-MoS2 nanoparticles, and the properties will be compared with the former nanocomposites.

343,81429,No,Incorporating the extrinsic drivers into fisheries management,"Traditional single species fisheries management has failed. In part because the single species are part of a wider ecosystem and must be managed in that context.

Space agencies are currently not pursuing a multi-spacecraft network for in-situ measurements in the middle and lower thermosphere because the cost of a network of 50 satellites built to industrial standards would be very high and not justifiable in view of the limited orbital lifetime. No atmospheric network mission for in-situ measurements has been carried out in the past or is planned for the future. A network of satellites for in-situ measurements in the middle and lower thermosphere can only be realised by using very low-cost satellites, and CubeSats are the only realistic option.

The Project will include the development of a deployment system for the deployment into orbit of a large number of single, double or triple CubeSats. Once, the system is developed for QB50 it can be easily adapted to other missions. QB50 will also provide a launch opportunity for key technology demonstration on IOD CubeSats such as propulsion systems and aerobrakes. Up to 50 CubeSats will be launched together to low earth orbit.

It focuses on two approaches for which the most important component is the spatial one; interactions between resources and environmental factors and the behaviour of fishery fleets. This project enters among works, which contribute, to a better comprehension of an exploitation system of natural resources and of its related management measures which can be applied, especially for durable exploitation objectives. The conduct of these researches is particularly relevant in Mediterranean, where the definition of the Common Fishery Policy is again in evolution.  The current situation of GIS in the maritime area leads to a field of scientific and technical question which will be studied in this project. It is proposed to apply the techniques of GIS in the state of the art and to develop original solutions for specific needs. The first action of this project concerns methods of representation, according to concepts of the GIS which imply especially to formalize the entities of the studied system, their attributes and their relationships. The objective is to test, to develop or to validate methods allowing obtaining relevant and consistent spatio-temporal representations, by integrating different sources of information. The new statistical approach of the spatio-temporal distributions and of their variability will be integrated in this phase of the project. The second action concerns the use of the GIS to build up analyses and modelling of the spatio-temporal dynamics of phenomena of the studied system, such as the influence of environmental conditions on exploited species, or effects of regulation on areas of fleets activity.  The subject of this study is focused on the aspects of marine exploited resources and fishery fleets by integrating the resources / environment and fleets / regulation relationships. It will concern demersal as well as small and large pelagic resources and will group competencies in populations dynamic, ecology, statistic, law and in GIS specialized computer.

625,43734,No,Feed-backs of estuarine circulation and transport of sediments on phytobenthos,"Coastal Zone Management (CZM) is widely recognised as a practice necessary for the sustainable use of coastal resources. Central to CZM is the recognition that in order to promote sustainability, coastal resources cannot be sectorially managed and the interactions that occur between adjacent sectors have to be fully considered. This is referred as an 'holistic' management approach. Many complex interactions occur between and within the different biological species in coastal ecosystems and their respective habitats. The ability of phytobenthic communities to locally modify the environmental characteristics of the ecosystem in which they live is one of the more significant relationships related to the human interactions. In fact, complicated feedback and feed-forward loops exist, that couple the establishment of phytobenthic communities, water quality and physical oceanographic parameters. Accurate understanding of these interdependencies will represent a significant improving of the environmental management capabilities, particularly allowing a reliable foreseeing of the evolution of phytobenthic ecosystems and their reactions to man-generated disturbances. F-ECTS main focus is the interdisciplinary investigation of the ecosystem loops in estuarine environments involving phytobentos communities, hydrodynamics, nutrient cycling and sediment transport, with the aim of integrating some of the aspects already investigated in the INTRMUD and BENFLUX Mast Projects and in the ROBUST Environment project. The Lagoon of Venice (Italy) will be considered as a pilot case study. Two major seasonal field campaigns will be carried out and will allow the parameterisation of the main physical and biological processes of the ecosystem providing a specific background for the assessment of the exportability of the obtained results in other two different European estuarine ecosystems: Lagunadella Ria Formosa (Portugal) and Roskilde Fjord (Denmark).  Based on the parameterised biophysical interactions, the modelling activities within F-ECTS will enable the set up of linked modules for the simulation of the feed-back loop between the physical processes and the phytobenthic habitat. This loop controlling the survival and evolution of an estuarine ecosystem will be considered from the biological perspective. To accomplish this, biological, hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes will be modelled together in F-ECTS. In particular a new SPM-phytobenthos-reaction model for cohesive sediment and estuarine ecosystems will be developed and used as a common module to which different hydrodynamic models tailored for each specific case study site can be coupled. To demonstrate how the joint exploitation of the field measurements and the model outputs provide support to the production of new 'environmental information' on the estuarine territories, GlS-based tools will be developed and implemented in the context of the pilot case study in a way that such new tools can be easily exported to other sites. These tools are expected to support the decision makers in identifying and planning CZM actions such as the ones related to wetland conservation and restoration, fishing, dredging and port operations. 02",1,0

The model must be able to interprete laboratory and field experiments, and also to be included in geosphere transport code for safety assessment. For this reason a series of codes, from detailed to simplified, must be developed and validated successively, at different scales. A simple one dimensional model has been developed, describing the transport of a radionuclide through a saturated porous medium - groundwater - colloid system with stationary groundwater flow. The colloid concentration can be varied in time and space and also the mass per colloid can be specified. Both nonlinear and linear sorption of radionuclides can be included. The following model assumptions are made: one type of colloid/one type of radionuclide; no speciation of the contaminant (sorption excluded); dispersion/diffusion coefficients are different for colloids and radionuclides; radionuclides do not distinguish between mobile and immobile colloids so their sorption is described by the same sorption isotherm; attachment and detachment of colloids to/from the solid phase can be described by a first order reversible equation.  An experimental study has been performed using a chromatographic technique, and concerned the distribution coefficients measurement. Impulse experiments were made to determine the number percentage of particles passing through the bed for the 3 different latex samples at 4 different values of ionic strengths, 2 different values of pH, and for a range of flow rates. Due to surface reaction with the glass beads the pH of the outlet solutions was always higher than the inlet pH. The higher the ionic strength and the lower the pH the greater the possibility for a given size of latex to be captured. In addition, extensive static batch experiments failed to show any detectable adsorption of latexes on glass beads. Another available result is the percentage of the particles passing through the bed as a function of ionic strength and flow rate: it confirms that the capture of colloids is increased by increasing the ionic strength. Another result is that, in a given column, an increase in the flow rate reduces the capture of the colloids. The higher the flow velocity the higher the Sherwood number: the lower the ionic strength and the higher the pH the lower is the Sherwood number with respect to that which would be expected.  With this aim a simple transport model has been formulated to evaluate the migration of pollutant and colloids in a fracture. It takes into account 3 phases: a solute phase containing radionuclides, a colloidal phase, and a porous medium as solid phase. The kinetics are not included in this model. The model is based on 2 types of equations: the equilibrium relationships, linking concentration of radionuclides, radionuclides adsorbed on colloids and radionuclides adsorbed in the porous matrix, and the mass balance equations. This model leads to a nonlinear system. To get a linear model and to determine the retention time of radionuclides, the colloid concentration is assumed to be constant. This assumption allows one to formulate a transfer function and to express the concentration of dissolved radionuclides. The first experimental work focused on the measure of the distribution coefficients between colloidal, solute and solid phases. The parameters which effectively control the transport were found to be the colloid concentration in mobile phase and the values of the linear coefficients. Work programme:   1. Literature survey. 2. Formulation of a first conceptual model. Screening of phenomena to be included in the model by performing simple calculations of test cases. 3. Planning of laboratory migration experiments with a simplified fixed solid phase. Research of optimal experimental conditions with the help of task 2. 4.

586,195178,No,DEsign of Multifunctional 2D-OrgaNic Hybrids,"Because of their reduced dimensionality and symmetry, two-dimensional (2D) materials withstand physical phenomena that are very different from their 3D bulk counterparts. Beside graphene, other members of the same family of materials include metal dichalcogenides (MX2) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Remarkably, while single-layer graphene is a semimetal, 2D h-BN is an insulator and 2D MoS2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor. A new paradigm in materials science consists in piling up into vertical stacks single sheets of 2D materials with complementary electro-optical characteristics, thereby paving the way to the fabrication of ultrathin and flexible multilayer heterostructure devices. DEMONH aims at designing multilayer architectures based on 2D material building blocks with tunable electronic structure and optical properties that can be prepared by solution processing techniques. Among many others, this approach offers the unique advantage that the electrical and optical characteristics of the elementary 2D units can be tuned over a broad range by functionalization of their surface with properly designed conjugated organic molecules, which: (i) assist in the exfoliation process and stabilize single or multiple layers as suspensions in the liquid phase; and (ii) convey to the resulting hybrid organic-2D materials new or improved functionalities. In particular, the use of light-responsive molecules opens up the possibility to remotely switch on and off charge injection and extraction at interfaces. In DEMONH, we will combine state of the art modeling tools to design multifunctional electro-active conjugated molecules yielding optimized (light-triggered) energy level alignment at interfaces and charge transport properties in stacked 2D layer architectures. Such design strategies require the development of appropriate theoretical models and their coding in efficient software programs, which will be implemented in a multiscale modeling platform.",0,0

NEPTUN will be the first CCAS capable of withstanding the whole grow-out cycle of fish, securing solid waste removal up to 90% (highest in the market), reducing mortality rate down to 0.4% (e.g. average rate in salmon farming in Norway: 10%) and feed costs in 10%, allowing adult fish densities of 50 kg/m3 (current limits for salmon farming in Norway: 25 kg/m3) without further depleting marine ecosystems. NEPTUN has the potential to increase e.g. global salmon production levels from current 2.2m t to 4.7m t (or 500,000t extra of fish protein), while minimizing the environmental impact of aquaculture activities (i.e. eliminate 363 t C, 45.5 t of N, and 8.5 t of P discharges from salmon farming in Norway alone). We have defined a subset of specific objectives covering final prototyping, validation, and commercialisation readiness activities. Achieving them will bring us to a wide market uptake.  1) Final prototyping objectives (WP1) to integrate and optimise the functionalities of NEPTUN’s subsystems, and deploy our prototype at our piloting facilities, raising NEPTUN TRL from TRL7 to TRL8. 2) Validation objectives (WP2) to demonstrate NEPTUN's technical and economic performance through a large-scale piloting in real-life operating settings, elevating our CCAS from TRL8 to TRL9. 3) Commercialisation readiness objectives (WP3-5) enabling us to successfully bring NEPTUN to the market and reach sales traction beyond Phase 2.  Through the NEPTUN SME Phase 2 project we will significantly boost the growth in our company.

The service will be designed to appropriately determine the effects of subsidence on current and future floodrisk in coastal lowlands, monitor the integrity of coastal barrier systems and infrastructure and assess the impact of subsidence due to natural or man-made causes (groundwater pumping and oil/gas production) on land use and hydrology. SubCoast will be built on the heritage of GMES Service Element ‘Terrafirma’ and use the full capability of PS-InSAR as a earth observation technology for large scale subsidence mapping.

721,104244,No,TARGETED DELIVERY OF NEW ANTISENSE MOLECULES FOR REGENERATION ENHANCEMENT AFTER SPINAL CORD INJURY,"'Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe physical and psychological damages. Classical pharmacotherapeutics have had limited success to treat this clinical condition and full recovery remains unachievable. With the understanding of the molecular pathology involved in neuronal injury and regeneration, new molecular targets are now under investigation. Our aim is to develop an antisense gene therapy approach mediated by single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides (ssAONs), targeted against inhibitors of axonal regeneration, in conjugation with a specific delivery platform for affected neuronal cells. The innovation of our strategy is two-fold: (1) it relies on the use and new developments of modified antisense oligonucleotides (LNA based 3rd generation ssAONs) with virtually no associated toxicity and an improved capacity to simultaneously down-regulate several genes involved in the inhibition of axonal regeneration after SCI; (2) the potential of the biodegradable and non-toxic biomaterial chitosan will be evaluated for the development of a multifunctional system capable of addressing the problem of low cellular uptake of naked oligonucleotides and especially the specific targeting of neuronal cells. The proposed ssAON strategy has immense benefits and its exploitation in the nervous system can have major implications for the treatment of several diseases in general.

961,47505,No,Information society and urban development in European comparison,"Goal of this investigation is to find out how the increasing use of information and communications technologies affects the development of cities in Europe. A pivotal question is whether processes of suburbanizasion are supported by the expansion of information and communications technologies, and thus spell further problems for cities. In the relatively-balanced urban system in Europe, cities are regional centres of innovation. The positive socio-economic development of an European urban system is indispensable to securing work, welfares, and employment, and to keep pace with competition throughout the world. We assume that the opportunities to innovate essentially depend on the strategies of actors in public institutions.  The study will examine how the actors of urban development assess the specific opportunities an (1 risks i.II this process, and which strategies they use to meet them. How do they perceive the impact of the increasing use of information and communications technology on the process of urban development? How do they integrate their visions for tile future into concrete urban planning strategies?  Hypothesis: The differing levels of knowledge and awareness among the administrative actors leads them to over or underestimate the impact of the information society on the process of urban development. This can lead to the application of unsuitable strategies. Along with the structural conditions for innovation, we assume that the administrative willingness to innovate will largely decide how the future might be designed across different regional contexts in Europe. A comparison at both the regional and national levels will enable us to explain the differences in the particular strategies used or preferred by the administrative actors across various spatial contexts.  In order to be able to react appropriately to the requirements placed by the information society on cities, and to use the opportunities for innovation, various tools and institutional changes are necessary in cities located in different regions and with different structures. The research consortium will draw on a range of methods, including qualitative case studies, quantitative inquiry, and interdisciplinary hearing. The findings are meant to provide both new insights into the genesis of urban development strategies, and a comparative understanding of the specific regional requirements pertaining to the spread of the information society.",0,0
1079,31246,Yes,Maerl Biodiversity: Functional Structure and Anthropogenic Impacts,"The objectives of this programme are five fold:  1. To investigate and describe the biodiversity of maerl systems in the NE Atlantic and mediterranean Sea.  2. To investigate the structural factors causing differences in biodiversity between sites. This will involve detailed assessment of site edaphic factors, in particular the structural complexity of the habitat.  3. To investigate the interactions of the key habitat-structuring organisms.  4. To investigate the dynamics of community composition over time, especially the impact of natural disturbances.  5. To identify anthropogenic threats to, and assess the resilience of, maerl grounds.  The collaboration envisaged will provide a comprehensive biogeographical coverage of sites from Scotland to Galicia in the Atlantic to Alicante and Malta in the Mediterranean, covering a substantial range of conditions under which maerl systems occur in European seas. At the completion of the programme a detailed inventory of regional biodiversity on maerl beds will be constructible. No such inventory exists at present.  It is the intention to describe the range of habitat conditions at each study site. Standard protocols would be applied to definition of site edaphic feature temperature, salinity, water transparency, current velocity, maerl granulometry and silt content and porosity, megarippling, assessment of percentage live maerl, sediment pH, organic content and redox potential. Different workers have, in the past, studied the biology of maerl system using different sampling methodologies, e.g. remote sampling using grabs and corers and direct SCUBA/TV methods. Direct methods of observation offer the best chance of investigating small-scale patchiness of undisturbed systems. Key species and structural features of the maerl community will be identified for detailed study at each locality. A diversity of chosen special topics between areas will achieve a much greater in-depth understanding of the variety of  physical/chemical/biological mechanisms affecting regional biodiversity. There will be considerable differences in species composition between the maerl communities in places as far apart as Millport and Malta. Flexibility will be retained between partners to exploit the circumstances of their own grounds to the full, while maintaining comparability in other studies.  Thus, comparative background investigations (of population density, biomass, diversity) will be deliberately harmonized between teams to provide a university comparative framework of data. It is vital that work proceeds at all seasons of the year, to take into account cycles of reproduction, colonization and migration, and allow analyses of the impact of natural stress factors, e.g. storms.  In each team's area, a perturbed and a control site will be selected for study of local impacts. The assessment of all these data will lead to the widest possible appreciation of the impacts of Man's activities [direct exploitation(Brittany, Glenan archipelago), scalloP dredging (Scotland), otter trawling (Alicante, Malta), aquaculture (Galicia, Malta), eutrophication effects (Brittany, Bay of Brest)] OII this most vulnerable ecosystem.",1,1

342,196473,No,Camelina Oil for Sustainable Salmon Aquafeed,"Seafood is a major source in the human diet of Omega 3 long-chain poly unsaturated fatty acids -such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)- , which plays a very important role in human health.  Fish oil is a vital strategic ingredient for farmed fish and crustaceans, since it provides the required quantities of Omega 3 fatty acids, especially at the critical growth stages. The prospects for increasing the production of fish oil are very limited, since most of the fisheries for fish oil production are now tightly monitored to not exceed the established fishing quotas and Total Allowable Catches (TACs). As current supply rates cannot keep up with demand, the fish farming industry, which grows close to 6% annually, in future will have to use less fish oil. To remain competitive, limit environmental degradation and optimize the efficient use of fish oil, the development of more resource-efficient and sustainable vegetable oil for aquafeed production is needed. Camelina oil, due to its unique fatty acid composition, is a sustainable vegetable oil that shows higher potential than other vegetable oils to replace fish oil in farmed salmonids diets while contributing to maintaining DHA and EPA levels. Camelina Company España (CCE), the European leader in sustainable camelina oil production,  will perform a feasibility study to evaluate the new business opportunity of introducing camelina oil as an innovative key ingredient in the new oil blend that salmon aquafeed producers are currently developing to reduce fish oil dependency and increase the technical and environmental performance of salmon fish feed.",1,0
129,32534,Yes,Mediterranean Targeted Project II-Mass Transfer and Ecosystem Response,"The main goal of the MATER project devoted to the Mediterranean Sea will be: - to study and quantify the triggering ans controlling processes of mass and energy (water ans its dissolved and particulate matter) transfer (transport and transformation) between the different compartments and in contrasting environments (from eutrophic to oligotrophic, from shelf to basins), - to appraise the time and space scales of the phenomena, in identified structures of the Mediterranean system (basin and subbasin, mesoscale and submesoscale),  - to investigate the ecosystem response to these transfers and its evolution with time, from short term to long term through seasonal and interannual, as recorded in the water masses, in the biological communities and in the sediment.  For a better understanding of the funtioning of the Mediterranean Ecosystem, interdisciplinary studies are needed to ensure a strong coupling between the dynamics of the water masses and the behaviour of dissolved and particulate, biogenic and abiogenic substances (source, transportation, transformation and sink). The interactions between experimentalists and modellers will be fostered, developping appropriate in situ observations to generate, to check and to calibrate models. The ecosystem models will be generated and applied at different scales for the entire system including the hydrological and biological system (benthic and pelagic) and long term changes. The proposal is structured in seven research tasks I to VII which present the scientific topics and six workpackages, from 1 to 6, which describe the operating strategy for a multi-disciplinary work plan; the three subbasins - Western Mediterranean, Adriatic/Ionian and Aegean/Levantine, represent the main sites of implementation..

207,95785,Yes,Diversity and community assembly in Caribbean reef fish,"Recent global recognition of the serious and immediate threats facing marine ecosystems has led to concerns regarding the loss of biodiversity within these systems. These concerns have highlighted the need for research to understand the driving forces behind current patterns of marine diversity. This information is vital in order to develop science-based strategies to maintain these ecosystems and their biodiversity. Unfortunately, little is known about how natural diversity varies within the marine environment, due to logistical constraints and traditional unfamiliarity with this environment. Therefore it is imperative that opportunities to address this issue are fully exploited. The applicant has identified a unique opportunity to understand how marine biodiversity varies across large spatial scales in one of the most diverse and threatened ecosystems in the world, coral reefs. Using the world’s largest marine sightings database, this research will map species richness (i.e. total number of species present) for coral reef fish communities across the Caribbean and Tropical Western Atlantic. This work will also map two other key measures of biological diversity, functional and phylogenetic diversity, as well as testing whether these measures are closely related, as is often assumed. A wide variety of environmental data is also available for the region, including climate and anthropogenic data, and these will be thoroughly tested for associations with reef fish diversity. Furthermore, cutting edge β diversity and community assembly analysis will be performed in order to understand the processes that have created the patterns we see today in these reef fish assemblages. Reef fish are considered to be useful indicators of overall patterns in coral reef biodiversity and the proposed research will produce a truly comprehensive analysis of this important and threatened ecosystem, to a level well beyond any that has been performed previously for marine systems.",1,1
136,36075,Yes,Baltic Sea System Study,"Coastal oceans in the highly dynamic boundary area between the terrestrial and oceanic realms are exposed to considerable external forcing by natural phenomena and human intervention. Particularly, semi-enclosed intra continental coastal seas with the reduced water renewal, such as the Baltic Sea, are most vulnerable to the human component. Due to the uncertainties in differentiating the impact of climate variability from anthropogenic disturbances the future reaction of coastal ecosystems to increased stress and to counter-measures is not predictable at present.  The Baltic Sea System Study (BASYS) aims at reducing these uncertainties in a multi-disciplinary project with 8 scientific subprojects: Pelagic processes, Lateral transport, Nearshore processes, Atmospheric load, Climate impact, Environmental record in the sediments, Systems analysis and modelling and Mesoscale physics. The 3 major objectives of the project are: - to improve the quantification of past and present fluxes  - to further the understanding of the susceptibility of the Baltic Sea toexternal forcing  - to achieve a sound scientific basis for the understanding of future changes. The work of BASYS encompasses retrospective aspects by studying the sedimentary record, long-term time series and hindcasting models as well process oriented studies on important system components like vertical and lateral fluxes, food web structure and their regulation by mesoscale physical phenomena. The 4 major working tasks are:  - assessment of time scales of significant changes and limits of complexityfor prediction  - translation of lateral and vertical gradients into mass balances - estimation of the sediment recording capacity in relation to lateral transporand pelagic-benthic coupling  - differentiation between natural and anthropogenic external forcing byunderstanding the preindustrial variability of the ecosystem. The various subsystems of the Baltic Sea are highly variable in their biogeochemical behaviour.

1104,5503,No,Development of a Lagrangian technique adapted for large scale and mesoscale current observations in the Mediterranean,"The main objective of this project is to establish the basis for future large scale Lagrangian experiments in the  Mediterranean Sea. The project intends to develop and to test a prototype float adapted for observing large scale and  mesoscale subsurface current in the Mediterranean Sea. The so called SOFARGOS float will be neutrally buoyant at a  predetermined (constant) depth where it will drift according to the horizontal currents. The float will be located by  triangulation using long range acoustic propagating signals  transmitted by sound sources fixed on moorings at prescribed positions.  The strength of the signal (level of correlation) received by the float, will be evaluated as a function of the distance  source-float, the float depth (300 m and 100 m), the sea state (ambient noise), and the seasonal temperature/salinity field. The level of correlation and the ambient noise (RMS) will be measured within the frequency band (780 Hz) at the float depth in order to discriminate how the noise level, the signal  attenuation during propagation, and the signal distortion  during reflection on sea surface (mainly due to a signal  decorrelation depending on sea state), is affecting the  acoustic signal correlation level. The sound sources will be maintained at constant depth (300 m). The float will be  equipped with 3 sensors: temperature, pressure, and compass. The compass (flux gate) will measure the rotations of the  float due to vertical water displacement. From the float  rotations versus time, giving the relative vertical speed, and the float pressure, giving the entrainment vertical speed, the absolute vertical velocity of water will be deduced with an  accuracy of about a fraction of a millimetre per second.   During the spring of 94, SOFARGOS floats and sound sources  will be deployed in the North West Mediterranean Sea for a  period of one year. About 10 acoustic sound sources will be  deployed at the periphery and in the centre of the basin and the floats will be deployed evenly in the Northern part of the basin (half at 300 m and half at 1000 m depth). The floats  will record internally on solid state memories all the data: ambient noise, strength (level of correlation) and time of  arrival of the sound source acoustic signals received at the float, in situ temperature, pressure, and float rotations. All these data will be transmitted during the final step of the  float mission (once the floats pop up to the surface) one year after launch. The typical range (max, min, and mean) for  acoustic propagation (and consequently float location) will be determined according to the frequency carrier, float depth,  sea state, and seasons. The accuracy of the float positioning will be determined according to the clock accuracy (both in  the float and in the sound sources), the sound speed and sound propagation and the sound source locations (mooring motions). During the test, after being calibrated in the laboratory, the performance of the 3 float sensor will be evaluated in terms of drift, stability and linearity. Finally, a data quality  control will concern the data transmission via Argos.",0,0
785,38652,No,Environmental planning and control system for industrial logistic networks,"Tackling the international problem of industrial pollution has become one of the biggest tasks of the ending millennium. In this context, the much discussed 'end-of-the-pipe' technologies move the problem to the end of the life-cycle of a product or to the end of the production process, without causing lasting alterations. In addition, the isolated focus on a company's production processes creates sub-optima which do not permit to profit from the potentials of the co-ordination of inter-company processes. It is therefore necessary to establish production integrated environmental protection of the whole logistical chain, though this will lead to a new dimension of complexity for the manufacturing industry. It is the aim of EPSILON to develop a software toolset which will facilitate the design and control of production systems within industrial logistic networks under environmental goals and constraints.  The aim of the EU Eco-Audit or the upcoming ISO14000 is to certify that a company is continually improving its eco-policy and is defining quantifiable environmental targets. To make these objectives applicable for the persons responsible for the production and product design, the user companies of the EPSILON consortium aim to produce a tool which will,  - Support the reduction of waste and pollution and reduce the environmental impact by supporting the design and controlling of inter-company material flow and the production processes themselves and in relation to their specific environmental impact under economic constraints;  - Provide on-line feedback of the environmental behaviour of the logistical processes according to the environmental targets;  - Monitor the environmental performance and initial environmental burden of products and processes both over the whole supply-chain and the production process;  - Allocate to products and processes the environmental burden according to their specific 'history'.

569,204460,No,Valley and spin devices based on two-dimensional semiconductors,"The main objective of this research proposal is to realize new types of electronic devices based on the valley/spin degree of freedom in two-dimensional semiconductors from the transition metal dichalcogenide family. These materials are analogous to graphene but have a direct band gap. Together with the unique band structure, this allows manipulating the spin and valley degrees of freedom interchangeably. In addition, it can give rise to a mechanism for protecting the spin which could in future result in very high spin relaxation lengths. This proposal will explore various spin/valley injection mechanisms as well as detection mechanisms with the goal of realizing an all-electric valleytronic device with no need of optical excitation which is bulky and difficult to scale and implement on chip scale. Various new device architectures such as valley interconnects, amplifiers and diodes will be realized in the central part of the proposal.",0,0
881,100058,No,Oxysterols and IL-27-induced Type 1 regulatory T cells in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis,"Accumulating evidence indicates that cholesterol metabolism plays a major role during acquired immune response. Cholesterol metabolites oxysterols have recently been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), considered to be the first cause of neurologic disability among young adults in occidental countries. MS is characterized by demyelination throughout the central nervous system associated with inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytic and mononuclear cell. The balance between pathogenicity of effector T cells and negative regulation imposed by regulatory T cells plays a major role in its development. Two important classes of regulatory T cells within the CD4\ subset are the Foxp3\ T-cells (Tregs) and IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1). Interest in Tr1 cells was revived with the discovery that they could be differentiated with the cytokine IL-27. This provided impetus to evaluate the potential of IL-27-induced Tr1 cells in autoimmune diseases. Here we propose to study the role oxysterol during Tr1 cell differentiation. We recently performed a screening for different oxysterols converting enzymes during T cell differentiation and found that IL-27 specifically induced the membrane-associated enzyme CH25H. Based on these results, we first propose to study how modulation of CH25H and its product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, influences Tr1 cell biology in vitro and in vivo using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We further aim to dissect the molecular pathways by which oxysterols modulates Tr1 cells in order to define new putative pharmaceutical targets to enhance Tr1 cell number and function. Indeed, this project will help unravel the role of cholesterol metabolites during CD4\ T cells differentiation and will assess their importance in the control of Tr1 cells during autoimmune diseases.",0,0
778,89321,No,Development of Sustainable Composite Materials,"The SustainComp project aims at the development of a series of completely new wood-based sustainable composite materials for use in a wide array of market sectors, ranging from the medical, transportation and packaging to the construction sector. A primary goal is to substitute fossil-based materials used in these sectors. The performance of today’s biocomposite materials is not sufficient for a range of applications. The approach is to better utilize the inherent properties of cellulosic fibres and nanocellulose fibrils in such materials.  The project encompasses the whole chain from production of modified fibres and nanocellulose through compounding and moulding to the final ecodesigned product for a number of product families. These new materials will integrate today’s large enterprises on the raw material and end-use sides (e.g. pulp mills and packaging manufacturers) and small and medium sized enterprises on the composite processing side (e.g. compounders and composite manufacturers).  It is envisioned that this will help the transformation of the traditional Forest Products Industry to more highly value added materials through the adaption of a set of advanced technologies such as the production of nanocellulose in larger scale, tailoring of fibres and nanocellulose, wet commingling, nanostructuring, layer by layer deposition and fibre spinning using nanocellulose fibrils.  More specifically the objective is to demonstrate new products within the following product families: i) Nano-reinforced foams (to replace styrofoams in the packaging and construction sector) ii) Moulded type of compounds, to introduce cellulose reinforced renewable biocomposites in the transportation and construction sectors iii) High throughput nanostructured membranes with designed selectivity for small-scale liquid applications in the medical field to large scale municipal applications  This project conforms to the envisioned composite program in the Forest Technology Platform.",0,0
587,217414,No,"A cost effective, self-calibrating, low maintenance pH sensor for an integrated approach to monitoring sea and drinking water, facilitating improvements in ocean, animal and human health","ANB Sensors (ANB) is a company set up to develop the next generation of pH Sensors for oceanographic, source water and aquifer monitoring and water resource management applications. In a short period of time, ANB has won innovation awards and grant funding and registered intellectual property (IP) (3 patents pending with a further 5 patents in the filing stage) covering new, fundamental pH sensor technology. The key failing of existing pH sensors is the short life and high maintenance costs of the sensors, which is a result of reference electrode drift giving unreliable measurements. The impact of reference drift is that most current ISE sensors cannot be used for long duration monitoring, cannot be used autonomously in smart sensor networks and require frequent, labour intensive calibrations. The only solution to reference drift currently available is expensive manual calibration. ANB’s innovative pH sensor, the pHenom, is based on a voltammetric electrochemical technique, which utilises a pH responding molecule bound within a solid-state matrix. This is combined with a novel means of verifying the performance of the pHenom’s reference electrode through an additional in-situ electrochemical measurement. For the first time, the pHenom sensor provides a pH sensor that is capable of smart, networked sensing allowing companies and government funded agencies to use their scarce monitoring management resources more efficiently. ANB’s overall objective for this project, therefore, is to develop the pHenom technology to the point where it can be placed on the market as-soon-as-possible, through technology licensing and sales. To meet this objective, in this project ANB will develop and produce four commercial prototype sensor systems specifically tailored for the biggest pH sensor market, the water monitoring and management industry. These commercial prototypes will be used to demonstrate the operational advantages of the pHenom technology to gain market acceptance.",0,0
351,5522,No,Recombinant bacillovirus expressed particulate vehicles as multiple epitopes presentation systems,"The project concerns development of safe and non-replicating effective multivalent vaccines for animal and human pathogens. These are to be realised by utilizing genetically engineered non-infectious empty protein capsids based (recombinant baculovirus synthesised) on bluetongue virus (BTV) articles (CLPs, VLPs) and porcine parvovirus capsids. These capsid structures have high immunogenic and protective activities. The objective is twofold: (1) to identify the regions on the capsid proteins that would allow the insertion of short immunogenic (B and T cell) epitopes of infectious agents, (2) to determine the capacities and efficacies of the chimeric capsid structure for protection against infectious agents. The core-like (CLPs) are assembled by two proteins, VP3 and VP7, with VP7 being the surface layer of the capsid. On the basis of recent three dimensional X-ray crystallographic structures of VP7 forming two sites within this molecule have been identified for extra sequence insertion. Both B and T cell epitopes from several viruses (Bovine leukemia virus, BLV, Polio, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCMV, Influenza, etc.) have been inserted and assembly of the chimeric CLPs, their biochemical and immunological properties were investigated. The data suggested that CLPs have the capacity to elicit both B and T cell immune responses and thus can be used as vaccine delivery systems. The VLPs structure has another capsid of two proteins (VP2 and VP5) of BTV surrounding the CLPs. The outermost protein VP2, which is has been analysed by computer modelling and subsequently, by mutagenesis analysis for localising the dispensable sequences. The results indicated at least four regions within VP2 molecules are available to localise, which can be substituted by immunogenic epitopes. Currently, these regions are being exploited for carrying protective immunogens of various infectious agents. Several antigenic sites have been identified in the N-terminus of the PPV protein VP2, which assemble into a capsid structure when expressed by baculovirus vector system. Some of these regions have been manipulated to carry foreign sequences such as B and T cell epitope of Polio and LCMV. The chimeric particles were tested for their immunogeneity and the results obtained indicated that while significant T cell responses were achieved by these chimeras, the particles failed to elicit B cell responses. Further studies for identifying the suitable regions for B cell epitope insertion are now under investigation.  SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS: It has been demonstrated that both chimeric CLPs and PPV capsids have the ability to elicit cellular and humoral immunity against a number of infectious agents and thus can be developed as efficacious vaccine delivery systems.",0,0
476,35437,No,Land use change interactions with fire in Mediterranean Landscapes,"LUCIFER attempts to : a) Determine how the structure of the landscape has changed in the last 2-4 decades in fire-prone areas of all the Mediterranean countries of the EU, how fires themselves have contributed to such change, and what role have landscape changes played in promoting fire; b) Assess whether fires induce a further homogenization of the burned area, hence increasing fire risk; c) Evaluate the relationship between the patch heterogeneity created by the fire and the postfire flows of soil, water and nutrients from the burned area; d) Establish the role of burned area (a fire or patches differing in burning severity) on the postfire species dynamics, assess the basis for species change between burns, in particular for rare/endemic species, as wall as the potential colonization of burned areas by new species; e) based on past landscapes and fire incidence, develop models of landscape change and its significance for species dynamics in order to evaluate fire risk and other threats to the ecosystem in fire-prone areas resulting from landscape changes.     The Mediterranean landscapes have been considered as a model of fine-grain, most diverse natural and cultural landscape caused by the ancestral human use of the land. However, in the last decades, improved socio-economic conditions in EU-countries have altered land-uses, eventually conducing to a simplification of landscape features. Parallel to this, fire occurrence has increased manifold. Fires dominate now in many areas in an unprecented way, and may be altering the ecosystems in unknown ways. How the changes in the landscape have affected fire occurrence is little known. Similarly, little is also known about the impacts on key processes for soil and species maintenance produced by the changes in the landscape caused by fire. Understanding these interactions is needed to properly manage these areas. Additionally, this knowledge could also serve as a model for understanding potential impacts of land-use change in other fire-prone areas of the world.   To achieve the project objectives landscapes will be reconstructed in areas of all EU countries importantly affected by fire. Additionally, fires will be mapped and their occurrence evaluated in relation to conditions and landscape structure. Similarly, fire risk will be evaluated in the reconstructed landscapes by using fire behaviour models and other fire risk methods. Furthermore, the role of fire in modifying the landscape, either in prefire homogeneous areas or in areas differing in their recent land-use history, will be investigated also in areas across the southern EU countries by means of field monitoring of the vegetation complemented with remotely sensed data. The role of spatial patterns produced by fire, either by the burned area or by patches of fire severity will be objective of particular attention. Postfire flows of soil, water and nutrients will be related to such spatial changes in one pilot area. Additionally, how burned areas or patches within burned areas affect species (plant and some animal groups) maintenance in the system, with particular attention to rare and endemic species or to species with an invading potential, will also be investigated. Monitoring of species dynamics within burned patches or fires will be conducted also in areas of the East and West Mediterranean. Case studies for both, invaders and rare/endemic species, will be made. Finally, knowledge gained will be integrated through modelling to evaluate future landscapes and their potential effect on fire occurrence and for species maintenance in fire prone areas.",0,0
225,86458,Yes,Marine life history strategies and biogeography: comparative study of the importance of benthic marine invertebrate early life history strategies in habitat connectivity for conservation management,"The ability to effectively protect marine biodiversity is dependent upon an understanding of the connectivity between marine regions and appreciation of the mechanisms driving speciation. Larval biology, which differs significantly between marine invertebrates, is a driving force for structuring populations and habitat connectivity; knowledge of the patterns and influences of larval dispersal is important. However, genetic structuring of present day populations may also be a result of past events, such as changed current systems and coastlines during times of low sea level stands.  This project will investigate the current paradigms describing the relationship between benthic marine invertebrate larval biology and their resultant biogeography and phylogeographic structure. Palaeogeographic and geotectonic factors will also be considered.",1,1
771,203228,No,Resolving conflicts between food security and biodiversity conservation under uncertainty,"Resolving conflicts between food security and biodiversity conservation under uncertainty  Conflicts between food security and biodiversity conservation are increasing in scale and intensity and have been shown to be damaging for both biodiversity and human livelihoods. Uncertainty, for example from climate change, decreases food security, puts further pressure on biodiversity and exacerbates conflicts.   I propose to develop a novel model that predicts solutions to conflicts between biodiversity conservation and food security under uncertainty. ConFooBio will integrate game theory and social-ecological modelling to develop new theory to resolve conservation conflicts. ConFooBio will implement a three-tiered approach 1) characterise and analyse 7 real-world conservation conflicts impacted by uncertainty; 2) develop new game theory that explicitly incorporates uncertainty; and 3) produce and test a flexible social-ecological model, applicable to any real-world conflict where stakeholders operate under conditions of extreme uncertainty.  The project has importance for society at large because ecosystems and their services are central to human wellbeing. Managing a specific natural resource often results in conflict between those stakeholders focussing on improving food security and those focussed on biodiversity conversation. ConFooBio will illuminate resolutions to such conflicts by showing how to achieve win-win scenarios that protect biodiversity and secure livelihoods. In this project, I will develop a practical, transparent and flexible model for the sustainable future of natural resources that is also robust to uncertainty (e.g., climate change); this model will be highly relevant for environmental negotiations among stakeholders with competing objectives, e.g., the negotiations to set the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015.",0,0
960,42391,No,Functional analysis of the cdk inhibitor p21 and its regulation by cell cycle dependent degradation,"Research objectives and content  Progression through the mammalian cell cycle is controlled by the tightly regulated activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk's). Both positive and negative regulators of these kinases classify as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively, and dysregulation of these activities is implicated in a variety of malignancies. The novel class of cdk inhibitors appears to negatively regulate G1 phase specific cdk's and, thereby, inhibit cell cycle progression. p21 is a cdk inhibitor specifically implicated in mediation of the DNA damage checkpoint, cellular senescence, and differentiation (for review see Harper & Elledge, 1996). Since p21's very complex mode of function is not yet understood and conflicting data on its features were published my research proposal is focused on elucidating the activity of p21 in more detail under different physiological conditions. My well characterized set of newly established monoclonal antibobies to human p21 will hopefully give new insights in target preferences and function of p21 under various conditions. Presently, my major interest is p21's regulation on the level of protein stability, since my own preliminary results demonstrate a quick turnover of the protein, which is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation machinery. The post-translational regulation by altered protein stability appears to be an essential control mechanism of key cell cycle regulators.

Information on the location of fishing is rarely known, especially in international waters, yet it is critical since in many oceanic sectors non declared and illegal fisheries are affecting negatively ecosystems through over exploitation and by catch of non-target species Knowledge about the distribution of fishing boats is fundamental for the regulation of fishing activities as well for the conservation of the oceans. I propose a New Concept of ocean surveillance based on new bio-logging technologies fitted on large foraging marine predators. The OCEAN SENTINEL  Proof of this Concepts will (1) develop a logger called CENTURION that couple a XGPS platform detecting and locating radar emissions, with a satellite transmission system (Argos) that would send instantaneously the location of vessels to a receiving site, (2) deploy the logger on wide ranging animals used as platforms  and (3) make available immediately the information obtained from the CENTURION logger through a website. The OCEAN SENTINEL programme will generate important social benefits by providing information to a wide range of beneficiaries, from governments or regional authorities managing EEZ and natural resources, regional or national fishing authorities, researchers and non-governmental organisation in conservation. The concept will be tested in the Southern Indian Ocean from Crozet and Kerguelen Islands  where valuable and extensive fisheries operate in EEZs and over oceanic waters. This concept has the potential to be used in other areas where information on fisheries location is needed.

The sensor is based on an innovative supercontinuum laser that provides ultra-bright emission across the entire spectrum of interest. Such a light source in combination with a novel type of multipass cell in conjunction with specifically developed uncooled detector arrays will ensure highly sensitive detection. Broadband single-shot 2D high resolution absorption spectra capture will allow highly selective molecular detection in complex gas mixtures in the ppbv levels in real time. This high performance sensor constitutes a breakthrough in the field of trace gas spectroscopy. Moreover, in a hybrid approach, the main spectroscopic sensor will be complemented by a fine particle detector in order to obtain a complete picture of the air quality. Mounted on an adapted and optimized UAV (drone), the sensor will enable pervasive sensing on large scales outside urban environments where air quality monitoring remains challenging, e.g. along gas pipelines or around chemical plants. Also, FLAIR can guide emergency measures in case of chemical fires or leaks, wildfires or volcanic eruptions or even serve for oil and gas exploration or explosives related molecules detection, by far more cost-effectively than for missions on manned research aircraft. As such FLAIR provides a novel and ubiquitous tool addressing air quality related safety issues.

Development of rearing methods for marine fish larvae is still one of the major constraints for increasing aquaculture production of marine fish. Lipid peroxidation, specifically polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oxidation, is acknowledged as being highly deleterious resulting in damage to cellular biomembranes which contain large amounts of PUFA. Information in relation to in vivo lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defences either in wild or cultured fish species is quite limited.  To achieve the objectives the project will comprehensively investigate all three aspects involved in the control of lipid oxidation in marine fish, namely endogenous antioxidant systems, dietary inputs of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) and antioxidants, and lipid oxidation products.  Therefore, the project will determine, if possible, the PUFA status, antioxidant status and lipid oxidation status in fish from early stages to weaned fish in three marine species: gilthead sea bream, turbot and halibut.  The proposed work will increase knowledge of the biology of farmed European marine fish species with a view to improving larval quality and optimising their culture.

153,48176,Yes,Environmental and fisheries influences on fish stock recruitment in the Baltic Sea (STORE).,"Understanding the stock-recruitment relationship of fish stocks is crucial for generating biologically sound advice for the balanced, sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. At present the ICES Advisory Committee on Fishery Management uses the concept of safe biological limits (SBL) as a criterion to define exploitation and stock levels. This concept is based mainly on the assumption that below a certain spawning stock size, recruitment is negatively affected as a result of low egg production. When a stock is considered to be inside SBL, recruitment variability is expected not to depend on parental stock size, but rather be related to environmental and ecological factors influencing the survival of the early life history stages. So far, however, stock-recruitment relationships and critical stock levels identifying recruitment-limiting stock sizes are poorly defined for cod and sprat in the Baltic. The sensitivity of SBL's and reference points to environmental conditions, species interactions and parental stock structures for these stocks are uncertain and need clarification. The objectives of the research project are to:  1. Determine stock-recruitment relationships for Baltic cod and sprat in relation to key environmental factors influencing the production of viable spawn and the survival of early life history stages.  2. Improve short-term predictions of stock development by integrating recruitment estimates based on the present status of the stock and its biotic and abiotic environment.  3. Develop predictive recruitment models for medium- to long-term forecasts of stock development under different environmental and fishery scenarios.  4. Estimate biological management reference points, critical stock limits and target spawning stock sizes based on stock-recruitment relationships and stock development simulation models, and considering the precautionary approach for fisheries management.  2. Methodology and research tasks  The key questions to be answered by the proposed project are: how do environmental factors influence the stock-recruitment relationship for cod and sprat stocks in the Baltic and what are the implications of variations in these factors for the use of biological reference points and critical stock limits in the management of the fisheries.  These questions will be addressed by following tasks:  1. Evaluating the accuracy of the spawning stock biomass as a measure of viable egg production by: a) determining the reproduction potential of the stocks in relation to sizes and structures of the spawning stocks, sex ratios, maturation processes and spatial distribution of the populations; b) determining the viability of the produced eggs in relation to parental growth conditions and contamination with toxic substances. 2. Resolving the direct impact of hydrographic factors on the fertilization and developmental success of cod and sprat eggs and early larvae by field and laboratory experiments. 3. Identifying and describing the hydrographic, oceanographic and behavioural processes influencing growth, survival and distribution of young of the year cod and sprat and determining the component of the spawning stock contributing to recruitment through the examination of survivor characteristics. 4. Developing and employing combined drift and feeding models to ascertain the potential role that interannual hydrographic variability has on survival and growth of eggs and larvae. 5. Determining the impact of predation on early life stages of cod and sprat caused by clupeids. Extending the time series of stock and recruitment estimates of cod and sprat utilizing MSVPA. This includes a disaggregating of stock and recruitment estimates into different spawning areas characterized by specific environmental conditions. 6. Integrating the findings of the previous tasks into new recruitment models and thereby assess the utility of such models in management applications, e.g. simulation of medium- to long-term stock development scenarios under different environmental conditions and fishing activities, forecasts of annual recruitment ranges to be used as input in short-term stock predictions, determining SBL's and biological reference points and their sensitivity to environmental perturbations.",1,1

368,106990,No,DEsigning new Paths in The differentiation Hyperspace,"The adult human organism contains heterogeneous reservoirs of pluripotent stem cells characterized by a diversified differentiation potential. Understanding their biology at a system level would advance our ability to selectively activate and control their differentiation potential. Aside from the basic implications this would represent a substantial progress in regenerative medicine by providing a rational framework for using small molecules to control cell trans-determination and reprogramming. Here we propose a combined experimental and modelling approach to assemble a predictive model of mesoderm stem cell differentiation. Different cell states are identified by a vector in the differentiation hyperspace, the coordinates of the vector being the activation levels of a large number of nodes of a logic model linking the cell signalling network to the transcription regulatory network. The premise of this proposal is that differentiation is equivalent to rewiring the cell regulatory network as a consequence of induced perturbation of the gene expression program. This process can be rationally controlled by perturbing specific nodes of the signalling network that in turn control transcription factor activation. We will develop this novel strategy using the mesoangioblast ex vivo differentiation system. Mesoangioblasts are one of the many different types of mesoderm stem/progenitor cells that exhibit myogenic potential. Ex vivo, they readily differentiate into striated muscle. However, under appropriate conditions they can also differentiate, into smooth muscle and adipocytes, albeit less efficiently. We will start by assembling, training and optimizing different predictive models for the undifferentiated mesoangioblast. Next by a combination of experiments and modelling approaches we will learn how, by perturbing the signalling models with different inhibitors and activators we can rewire the cell networks to induce trans-determination or reprogramming.",0,0
945,227896,No,Monitoring functional traits by combining multi-scale and multi-temporal remote sensing data to assess biodiversity across Europe,"Biodiversity is a critical indicator of ecosystem functioning and health.   Greater native biodiversity enhances ecosystem function, productivity, resilience, variability of the genetic pool, and a multitude of other ecosystem services. With the technology available now, remote sensing is the only efficient tool to assess biodiversity over regional to global scales because it can provide measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent studies have started to explore the potential of remote sensing to estimate biodiversity attributes and patterns in natural and managed ecosystems. Most studies to date have used moderate resolution satellites to investigate species richness with somewhat mixed results. Few studies have had access to image spectroscopy data, which allows greater power in determining the relationships between spectral variability and biodiversity. While it is crucial to measure biodiversity across systems and scales, achieving this goal is challenging. Metrics or indicators are necessary for measuring and monitoring biodiversity at regional to global scales. In this line accurate information on functional traits can provide a baseline for monitoring biodiversity. The main objective of this study will be to assess biodiversity based on functional trait monitoring on a diversity of forest communities along Europe. The proposed study will exploit the high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution data obtained from multiple remote sensing instruments. From a remote sensing point of view, the  novelty or this research will be to take advantage of each sensor’s capabilities and extend our analysis in both space and time; and from an ecological point of view the novelty could be to develop a workflow for both downscaling and upscaling biodiversity across multiple forest types along Europe.",0,0

Within this general agenda, the COMED project focuses on one broad category of healthcare technologies (medical devices) for exemplary, empirical purposes to: (i) improve economic evaluation methods for medical devices in the context of the HTA framework by increasing their methodological quality and integrating data from different data sources; (ii) investigate health system performance through analysis of variation in costs and outcomes across different geographical areas and (iii)strengthen the use of economic evaluation of medical devices in policy making. COMED’s ambition is to develop scientifically rigorous recommendations on what, when and how real world evidence sources can and should be used for assessment of medical devices.  COMED’s aim is to develop new methods for assessing patient reported outcomes for mHealth technologies. COMED will provide a comprehensive answer on the main drivers of clinical practice variations across Europe by differentiating between warranted and unwarranted causes of disparities. COMED will develop, for the first time, adequately researched policy advice for the early assessment and conditional reimbursement policy tools in the field of medical devices. The project will expand the geographic scope of evidence generation from a single jurisdiction to collaborative evidence generation throughout Europe. It will have a substantial impact by on public health in Europe, by providing scientifically robust evidence for a wide range of key stakeholders ranging from policy makers to patients and wider public",0,0
369,69692,No,Role of intercellular adherens junction in the regulation of endothelial cell growth and apoptosis,"Interendothelial adherents junctions play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. Null mutation of the endothelial specific VE-adhering gene leads to impairment of vascular remodelling and endothelial survival, which is in part due to the loss of VEGF function as a survival factor in these instants. As it was shown that VE-adhering forms complexes with the VEGF receptor 2, in this project we will investigate the significance of VE-adhering in regulating VEGF function and which role beta-catena plays in this process. In adulation, since VE-adhering is an important determinant of contact inhibition of cell growth in the endothelium, the signalling processes at the basis of this activity will be studied. In order to address these questions endothelial cells cultured from VE adhering deficient mice will be used as a model for transfixion of various VE-adhering mutants in an endothelial background. Mutant proteins will be designed to alter either the binding or the detachment of beta-catena from VE-adhering. Furthermore the involvernent of the p120^ctn binding site and the significance of the extra cellular domain of VE-adhering will be investigated. In a second step, the beta-catena gene will be inactivated in endothelial cells specifically a Crew-Lox approach in vivo and the animal phenotype will be studied.",0,0
146,199452,Yes,STRengthening MARritime Technology Research Center,"INEST TEC is strongly committed to become a center of excellence in maritime technology and, in particular, deep sea technology. It is strategically located, with fast access to deep sea, it has been steadily building up its skills, capabilities and resources, and is presently in the process of implementing an open research infrastructure, thus preparing itself to become capable of providing services and open access to the European academic and industrial communities and, thus, become a recognized European maritime research asset. This proposal thus aims at creating solid and productive links in the global field of marine science and technology between INESC TEC and established leading research European institutions, capable of enhancing the scientific and technological capacity of INESC TEC and linked institutions (as well as the capacity of partnering institutions involved in the twinning action), helping raising its staff’s research profile and its recognition as an European maritime research center of excellence. These objectives will be fulfilled through a set of measures: summer schools; winter schools; short-term scientific meetings;  Long-term Staff visits; Networking meetings; Workshops; Conferences; technology transfer workshops with stakeholders; and other dissemination activities. Therefore this proposal addresses the challenges raised in the call H2020-TWINN-2015. In particular, it takes INESC TEC, a top level Portuguese institution, and places it as the pivot of a network of excellence, involving four European Partners which are international leaders in deep sea technology. By tackling the call challenge with the specific topic of deep sea technologies, STRONGMAR is aligned with several National and European priorities (“The Portuguese Strategy for Smart Specialisation” (2014); Portuguese “National Ocean Strategy” (2013); EU Commission’s Atlantic Strategy (2011), etc.) establishing a consolidation path of INESC TEC's strategy in these areas.",0,1
500,84323,No,On-board autonomous calibration for highly precise space vector magnetometers,"The fluxgate magnetometer for high precision measurements from space onboard LEO (low Earth orbit) satellites has an excellent behaviour regarding offset stability and low non-orthogonal angles drift. However, the scale factors tend to drift due to the aging and degradation caused by the radiation to which the electronics (in particular the reference device inside the instrument) is exposed.  Therefore, it is customary to fly an absolute scalar magnetometer to in-flight calibrate the fluxgate. The comparison between the instruments is made on ground and a set of temporal correction for the parameters is estimated. This is the case for the dedicated mapping missions orsted, SAC-C and CHAMP (launched in 1999, 2000 and 2000, respectively). The autonomy of the instrumentation onboard is limited to the basic operational features of the spacecraft, which relays of a minimum of onboard computations.  This avoids possible unrecoverable potential faults, which is also complaint with a robust system as it is the case of these mentioned satellites. The goal of presented project is to analyze, develop and finely implement electronics and algorithms of corrections to the instrument. The implementation of such corrections will guarantee the invariability of the instrument parameters during the mission lifetime and it will also reduce the costs of pre-, in- and post-flight calibrations as it is experienced in the orsted/SAC-C/CHAMP satellites.  This is of special interest with the coming multipoint satellites missions, like the E SA Swarm proposal (where orsted DTU MI is presently involved in actively), where resources could be minimized regarding instrumental calibration. The successful implementation onboard will increase and extend the level of instrument autonomy and its data processing, and also the data quality, whose user (the scientific community) will also benefit from.",0,0
86,191152,Yes,Arctic Sea Ice and Greenland Ice Sheet Sensitivity,"The cryosphere is in fast transition. The possibility that the ongoing rapid demise of Arctic sea ice may instigate abrupt changes on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) is not tackled by current research. Ice cores from the GIS show clear evidence of past abrupt warm events,up to 15 degrees warming in less than a decade, possibly caused by disappearing se ice in the Nordic Seas..Arctic sea ice extent was in 2012 half of the 1979-2000 average. Satellite data document an increasing loss of GIS ice mass since 1990 and temperatures have risen markedly at the GIS summit. Strong transient changes in both Arctic cryospheric entities prompts the question: Is the dramatic decline in Arctic Sea Ice heralding a new phase of abrupt change, similar to those recorded in ocean sediments and ice cores?  Such changes would have major consequences for the GIS mass balance and global climate and sea level. Ice2Ice will approach this complex problem by integrating 4 PI teams from three Nordic world class research centres comprising empiricists and dynamicists specialized in Arctic and Greenland  atmospheric, oceanic and cryospheric sciences. With an innovative combination of synchronized records of GIS parameters, records of sea ice change and models ranging from global climate models to regional and process models, Ice2Ice will be the first concerted effort to tackle the question of the cause and future implications of past abrupt climate change in Greenland, the main hypothesis being that Arctic and sub-Arctic sea ice cover is key to understand past and future Greenland temperature and ice sheet variations. In Ice2Ice this will be done by:a)describing the nature, timing and extent of abrupt events across climate archives,b)resolving mechanisms behind the sudden demise of sea ice cover,c)identifying the risk that the ongoing rapid diminution of Arctic sea ice cover could give abrupt GIS changes in the future, d)determining the impacts of such changes for the GIS, Arctic and global climate.",1,1
673,14515,No,Regional Evolution Planning for IBC,"The long term aims of the project are:    - to explore opportunities for the implementation of IBC in sparsely populated regions   - to outline technically, and economically feasible solutions to meet the above objective   - to support strategic planning for IBC in the less favoured regions (LFRs).   -  To specify IBC experiments in rural areas, in order to illustrate the above conclusions.  The long term aims of the project are to explore opportunities for the implementation of integrated broadband communication (IBC) in sparsely populated regions, to outline technically, and economically feasible solutions to meet the above objective, to support strategic planning for IBC in the less favoured regions (LFR) and to specigy IBC experiments in rural areas, in order to illustrate the above conclusions. A set of evolution scenarios most likely ot be implemented within LFR were identified and assessed. This included the impact of mobile and satellite technologies on LFR, and conversely, how such systems might best be configured to take account of the needs of LFR. REVOLVE developed a network design computer tool named GRAPHITE which has since been used in research and development in advanced communications technologies in Europe (RACE) projects. Detailed specifications for broadband network experiments in the Mangualde (Portugal) and Epirus (Greece) areas are being developed. These are mainly focused on the extension of fibre deployment as close to user premises as possibly and on integrating existent telephone services with television. The study will take into account similar experiences in other areas of Europe and the United States. The strategy of REVOLVE for both areas Epirus and Mangualde is based on: a strong local platform involving the local and regional development agents and the local research and development in advanced communications technologies in Europe operator; early implementation and operation of demonstrating systems providing specific applications to some business users in Epirus and the early installation of a broadband pilot, in Mangualde, supporting advance communication experiments for existing local service providers. Business plans for both areas are being developed, with equipment manufactureres helping in the specification of feasible solutions. Technical Approach    To begin phase 2 of the project, detailed specifications for broadband network experiments in the MANGUALDE (Portugal) and EPIRUS (Greece) areas are being developed. These are mainly focused on the extension of fibre deployment as close to user premises as possible and on integrating existent telephone services with television. The study will take into account similar experiences in other areas of Europe and the USA.  The strategy of REVOLVE for both areas EPIRUS and MANGUALDE is based on:    - a strong local platform involving the local and regional development agents and the local telecom operator   - early implementation and operation of demonstrating systems providing specific applications to some business users in EPIRUS   - the early installation of a broadband pilot, in MANGUALDE, supporting advanced communication experiments for existing local service providers.    Key Issue    REVOLVE addresses questions of IBC realisation and European network evolution from the view point of EC Member States containing major LFRs, ie Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Northern Ireland (UK), the 'Mezzogiorno' Region of Italy and the Highlands and Islands Region of Scotland(UK).  More than one fourth of the total EC population lives in these LFRs.    Achievements    During phase I of the project, a set of evolution scenarios most likely to be implemented within LFRs were identified and assessed.  This included the impact of mobile and satellite technologies on LFRs, and conversely, how such systems might best be configured to take account of the needs of LFRs.    REVOLVE developed a network design computer tool named GRAPHITE which has since been used in RACE projects ATD (R1022) and ADVANCE (R1009).  The main conclusions of REVOLVE will be published in two books: Europe Connected or Disconnected? Broadband Networks in Less Developed Regions, and A Network Planner's Reference Guide.    The first results from phase II of the project followed a series of visits to European broadband experiments, to understand the technical and applications solutions under trial.  During this phase the project has a specific task to investigate possible funding options.  Details on the various EC options that are available (LEADER, ORA, TELEMATIQUE, RACE and the European Investment Bank) have been documented, and as a result, the partners conducting experiments have submitted proposals for funding.    Local platforms have already been established in EPIRUS and MANGUALDE supporting future introduction of services, information gathering, and real cooperation on the specification of possible applications.  Business plans for both areas are being  developed, with equipment manufacturers helping in the specification of feasible solutions.    Expected Impact    Tools developed by REVOLVE will help strategic planners in those countries having rural populations to consider, thereby contributing significantly to integrated development of IBC in Europe.  The specification of trial broadband networks for the EPIRUS and MANGUALDE areas are to be supported by specific business plans prepared by the project.  To this extent, the project seeks to provide justification for national and EC investment to extend IBC to LFRs.",0,0
441,218328,No,"Rates of Interglacial Sea-level Change, and Responses","Global sea-level rise is one of our greatest environmental challenges and is predicted to continue for hundreds of years, even if global greenhouse-gas emissions are stopped immediately. However, the range, rates and responses to sea-level rise beyond 2100 are poorly understood. Current models that project sea-level rise centuries into the future have large uncertainties because the recent observations upon which they are based, encompass too limited a range of climate variability. Therefore, it is crucial to turn to the geological record where there are large-scale changes in climate. Global temperatures during the Last Interglacial were ~1oC warmer than pre-industrial values and 3-5oC warmer at the poles (a pattern similar to that predicted in the coming centuries), and global sea level was 6-9 m higher, far above that experienced in human memory.  Through the RISeR project, I will lead a step-change advance in our understanding of the magnitude, rates and drivers of sea-level change during the Last Interglacial, to inform both global and regional sea-level projections beyond 2100. Specifically I will:  1. Develop new palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of Last Interglacial sea-level change from northwest Europe; 2. Provide the first ever chronological constraints on the timing, and therefore rates, of relative sea-level change that occurred in northwest Europe during the Last Interglacial; 3. Use state-of-the-art numerical modelling to distinguish the relative contributions of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the Last Interglacial; 4. Provide estimates of the land areas and exposed populations in northwest Europe at risk of inundation by long-term (2100\) sea-level rise, providing high-end scenarios critical for coastal-risk management practice.  These ambitious objectives will result in a state-of-the-art integrated study of the most appropriate analogue for a critical global environmental challenge; future sea-level rise.",1,0
570,48026,No,Identification of species in processed seafood products using DNA based diagnostic techniques.,"Fishery products comprise a wide variety of species and products from which is difficult to know the composition, especially in the case of thermally processed seafood products. Identification of fish species in these products, by specific protein profiles, could be hindered by the denaturation of these proteins caused by the severe thermal treatment used during the elaboration of these products. The use of DNA analysis as a tool for species identification has shown to be successful for identifying canned tuna species (AIR2 CT94-1126). The use of DNA diagnostic techniques for different groups of products could be of value since in some cases there is not a reliable method of identification, such in sterilised products. In other cases the presence of several sources of fish can impede the identification. It is thought that DNA analysis techniques could solve several authentication problems up to now unresolved.  The work program in this project will involve the study of the following type of products:  a. Sterilised products  Canned fish and mollusc  Baby Food  Fish Pate b. Heated Products  Smoked Fish  Fish meal  Pre-cooked Fish and mollusc c. Non-heated Products  Caviar  This study will comprise several steps needed for the determination of the best methodology to be applied in each case:  1. Collection, authentication and preparation of products. 2. Developing of DNA isolation methods suited to each product. 3. Cytochrome b and Control region DNA sequencing in species of interest. 4. Designing of primers for the obtaining of DNA fragments from the products. 5. Development of secondary DNA- diagnostic methods based on analysis of PCR amplicons. 6.

The objective of the RISICO project is to develop analytical methods to predict the exposure to xenophobic mixtures in sea-sprays and in marine sediments and their effects on coastal ecosystems. A direct business application will be the development of sustainable detergents.  The innovative aspects include the development and validation of (1) Specific analytical methods targeting surfactants in sea sprays, (2) A non destructive radiotracer approach to characterize kinetics of surfactants biological uptake and subsequent destabilization in target marine organisms, (3) Insight into the bioavailaiblity and sorption of organic xenobiotics in marine sediments, (4) A microbiofilm in stratified toxic/anoxic sediments to identify recalcitrant metabolites, and (5) New standardized ecotoxicity tests for marine sediments.  These aspects will contribute in the development of marine risk assessment guidance (EU TGD, Commission directive 93/67/EEC) for the safe use of surfactants in Europe as requested by the EU White Paper (Com (2001) 88 Final). We encourage the fellows to use their data to present a PhD thesis. The fellows can follow complementary training courses in aspects such as time management and leadership. The training will offer various career possibilities for the fellows. The Marie Curie Programme fits very well with the P and G's training policy, because the development of our people's skills are essential parts of our successful career development.",1,1

42,27111,Yes,Climate change and coastal evolution in Europe,"To study the effects on Atlantic and North Sea coastal zones of climate induced relative sea-level changes, variations in storminess patterns, and occurence of extreme flooding events, in particular, the response of coastal systems, and the sediment delivery to those systems.  To assess the links between the short term time-scale, and the longer (geological) time-scale.  To provide better tools for forecasting future changes of coastal dynamics, useful for coastal management authorities.  To provide a considerable exchange - and to promote the development - of technical know-how, methodologies, and specific expertise between the participating organisations.  To assess the impact of human activities on coastal zones.   The objectives will be reached through the integration of two lines of research:  On the short term time scale (year/decade to century) and at selected sites, the quantification of the response signals of coastal change to relative sea-level rise and changes in storminess (extreme flooding events).  On the long term time scale (century to millennium) and in a regional sense, investigation and - where possible - quantification of the recognizable signals of coastal response to known or extrapolated sea-level changes and reconstructed climate fluctuations. The significance of the local, short term responses to more regional coastal behaviour are to be assessed.  One of the problems faced, is the relationship between these two scales. It is still unclear how the geological, the historical, and the tide-gauge records relate to one another. It will therefore be necessary to define, generate and test new analytical methods. This will promote the integration of the long term approach - based on the Holocene sedimentary record - and the short term data set of coastal and tidal changes, sea-level fluctuations and storminess patterns.  The exchanges between the participating organisations will be furthered by field workshops, laboratory trainings, and support and trainings in computer-assisted techniques.  Where possible, attention will be paid to what degree human activities in the coastal zones trigger a measurable response of coastal evolution. For instance: The effect of removal of sediments from coastal areas for construction work; the effects of changes in land use inland and their impact upon the sediment delivery to the coastline; the effects of coastal protection measures on adjacent coastlines with no protective structures; the effects of human activity on dune-fringed coasts; the effects in earlier times of deforestation on sedimentation rates.",1,1

The objective of this project is to tap these new possibilities for applications in the technical domain, especially to provide support for decision makers in a complex and continuously changing environment. This support is based on applying rules and process knowledge on available data published to the web. The data comprises measurements, human observations and design information. Data acquisition and process control is assisted by self-describing devices, e.g. measurement sensors or intelligent sub-systems, installed in the considered technical systems. The technology will be demonstrated by applications in the field of electro-technical systems, decentralised energy systems and environmental measurement systems. Dissemination will take place through the project website, presentation of papers and demonstrations given at conferences and workshops, provision of publicity material and a user group.  The user group will be the starting point for exploitation by both the consortium members directly and by partnerships outside the consortium. The key standardisation task is to move the current generation of standards for design, engineering and process monitoring data to OWL ontologies, and thus make the appropriate data models available for semantic web technologies. Innovations provided by the project will comprise an ontology that enables a device to announce its existence, position in a network, and the services it provides. Also, the capturing of human qualitative observations and their publication on the web with respect to a formal ontology, as well as the development of rules that can be applied to any kind of technical data available on the web are key innovations.

I will analyse the effects of marine environment and cumulative human pressures on marine megafauna using electronic monitoring systems and earth observations, which now allow an unprecedented opportunity to simultaneously monitor marine animal movement, ship-based activities and the marine environment. I will direct the research through a multidisciplinary approach, combining state-of-the-art quantitative methods and computational tools from movement ecology, oceanography and marine spatial planning. I will demonstrate this approach in the Mediterranean Sea, a hotspot for marine megafauna under pressure from multiple human influences. The region can serve as a miniature ocean to investigate climate-driven effects and explore the potential application of dynamic conservation measures in trans-boundary areas. Results will allow the linking of key enabling ocean observation technologies to their application in assessing the potential impacts from anthropogenic activities and promoting the sustainable development of maritime industries. This is a matter of enormous concern for Europe, since our results will provide the scientific basis to establish future conservation actions within the framework of Integrated Maritime Policy. This proposal marries skills and expertise that maximizes the chances of the project’s success. The host lab, supervised by Prof Godley, has a long history of research in marine movement ecology, particularly those associated with marine vertebrates and conservation research.

Today, this labour-intensive, time-consuming and subjective process is conducted by fishermen. By speeding up the onboard grading process and unleashing the potential of real-time data, SEASCANN is a game-changer for the fish value chain: fully automatic, it provides a high throughput (1 fish per second), saves 35% labour costs, and yields a high-quality product avoiding almost 100% of post-harvesting loss. With SEASCANN, Skaginn delivers an automated vision system that sorts large quantities of fish based on species, size and quality, increasing quality and value. SEASCANN also makes real-time catch information available for fishing companies, processors, researchers & authorities, assisting decision-making at several levels. SEASCANN enables fisheries turn from single- to more sustainable multi-specific businesses, and benefits society by collecting reliable fisheries-related data. While two prototypes have been already implemented in vessels, the objectives now are to achieve a completely-automatic solution with accuracy of 99% for seven North-Atlantic species (cod, haddock, pollock, hake, mackerel, herring), with data being transferred in real-time to standardised databases.

738,91622,No,Developing a partial fishmeal replacer from EU plant raw materials for use in aquaculture,"In recent years, aquaculture has grown substantially in the world and particularly in the EU where it is important for providing a variety of fish products for the consumer. In addition, this sector helps reduce the great imbalance in the EU between imports of fish products and exports. It also creates jobs in difficult coastal and rural areas with few other industries and limited alternatives for employment.  However, the EU is highly dependent on fishmeal imports for feed production to meet the needs of the expanding aquaculture sector. This dependence imposes a heavy economic burden on the Community. At the same time, the general trend has been for the fishmeal supplies and prices to fluctuate widely. Recently, the El Nino phenomenon served as a reminder of the heavy fluctuations and risks involved in the availability of fishmeal. Moreover, recent concerns over the dioxin levels in fish-meals and the consumer health risks have aggravated the situation.",0,0
916,99053,No,Regulation of ventral otic patterning and integration with general programmes of neurogenesis in the zebrafish embryo,"Both during my diploma and my PhD project, neural development has been a focus of my research interest. During my PhD thesis I have worked with the role of signalling pathways on the specification and patterning of the caudal neural tube and during early olfactory development mostly using an in vitro system. Now I would like to change focus and a future challenge lies in understanding the molecular interactions that underlie animal development. The proposed work together with Tanya Whitfield at the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics (CDBG) in the Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield would enable me to take a new, genetics based approach to questions that have fascinated me for a long time and increase my experience with in vivo studies. The otic placode gives rise to non-sensory, sensory and neural structures of the inner ear. Early during development, neural and non-neural regions form in the otic epithelium and both the first sensory hair cells and the neurons of the statoacoustic ganglion arise from ventral regions. Work from the Whitfield lab has implicated Eya1/Six1, Tbx1 and Otx1 in regulating neural versus non-neural patterning of the zebrafish ventral otic epithelium, but how these factors interact to regulate sensory patch spacing, and integrate with general programmes of neurogenesis, is not understood. I plan to elucidate in detail the genetic network responsible for ventral otic patterning. In a first step I plan to characterize the system through the analysis of the expression patterns of patterning (eya1/six1/tbx1/otx1) genes, neural progenitor soxB1 genes and markers for sensory neurons and hair cells in wild-type and mutant zebrafish lines.  In parallel, I will start to test the model that Tbx1 and Otx1 restrict neurogenesis in the ear using double mutants, morpholino knockdown and overexpression experiments. Using a new otx1 mutant line, I will examine the role of Otx1 in specifying the lateral semicircular ca",0,0
1029,227310,No,Deciphering the tumor-immune-microenvironment profile and organization within the tumors of melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy,"Cancer progression is a complex process that depends on the interplay between tumor cells, tumor microenvironment, and the immune system. Inhibiting immunosuppression is beneficial for cancer patients. Although these therapies are promising they are successful only in part of the patients. Tumors are composed of distinct cell types with different phenotypes, that influence the efficacy of immunotherapies. Therefore, in order to better understand tumor biology and response to treatment, it is necessary to profile protein expression while preserving spatial information. Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) is a method in which antibodies conjugated to metals are used to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins in intact tissue specimens by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Here we suggest to uncover the immune profile and organization within the tumors of melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy using MIBI-TOF. My first objective is to characterize the tumor-immune microenvironments to understand how these are structured across patients and discover predictive features of response to immunotherapies. My second objective is to analyze the intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of melanoma patients by exome sequencing. I will examine whether there are genetic correlates between ITH, immune microenvironment and response to therapy. Finally, my third objective will be the manipulation of individual hits to test their functional significance in tumor-immune architecture in murine models. By joining Dr. Keren’s lab that masters the MIBI-TOF technology, I will acquire this state-of-the art technique, as well as develop lab management and organization skills, and I will meet leader scientists from the immune-oncology field.

1147,60581,No,The Role of Marketing Actions in Accelerating the Time-to-Take-Off for Emerging Technologies: An Econometric Analysis,"Research objectives and content  Achieving rapid take-off for new technology-based product categories is a common managerial objective. The fast emergence of a dominant design can have a significant impact on competitive dynamics of a market.  However, few marketing researchers have examined: (i) which proactive marketing actions can foster initial adoption of emerging technologies and (ii) the factors influencing a firm's commitment to these strategies.  The central concern of this paper is how firms can reduce 'take-off time' for an emerging technology. I first propose a set of strategic alternatives that a firm could undertake to stimulate initial demand for a new technology. I then test how preferences for these proactive strategies differ across firms as a function of technology and industry. To do so, I collect secondary data on sales of emerging technologies. By estimating a hazard rate model I can test what is the effect of marketing strategy on time to take off and how technology and competitive factors moderate this relationship.

539,195369,No,The Role of Adipose-Tissue Derived wnt-ligands in the Regulation of Myocardial Redox Signalling,"Myocardial redox signalling is a critical regulator of myocardial physiology and a therapeutic target in cardiovascular science, while obesity seems to trigger myocardial oxidative stress. The non-canonical wnt signalling pathways (Ca2\-dependent (CDP) and planar cell polarity pathway (PCP)) are important in cardiac development and they are also involved in obesity (wnt ligands are involved in adipose tissue expansion), although their role in the adult myocardium is unknown. We propose to define the role of CDP and PCP in the regulation of myocardial redox state in the human adult heart. We will perform a) Clinical association studies using tissue from patients undergoing cardiac surgery to test for paracrine effects of adipose tissue on myocardial PCP/CDP regulation b) Studies using ex vivo models of human myocardium (trabeculae) to test the role of CDP/PCP in myocardial redox state regulation c) Cell culture studies using primary human cardiomyocytes to explore the mechanisms of these effects d) Animal studies using a novel transgenic mouse model to test causality of the associations. In this translational study we will explore for the first time the role of CDP/PCP in the regulation of myocardial redox signalling and evaluate its role in cardiac physiology. This work may identify novel disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of myocardial diseases.",0,0

77,91387,Yes,Biofiltration and aquaculture: an evaluation of hard substrate deployment performance within mariculture developments,OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS This research project will demonstrate the effectiveness of reducing the environmental impacts of organic inputs from intensive mariculture by using biofilter deployments. The objectives relate principally to biofilter use over a pan-European scale that includes the inshore coastal waters of all the project partner states (ie will include fieldwork and experimental conditions relative to the Mediterranean and Red Sea interests of Israel).  The project has three inter-related principal objectives: To quantify the validity (effectiveness) of biofilter use in association with mariculture within both economic and environmental frameworks on a pan-European scale.  As components of this the project aims to: (i) review the current knowledge base relating to mariculture impacts on a pan-European scale; (ii) appraise current and past biofilter initiatives within Europe and outside Europe and synthesise this previously disparate research;,1,1
22,51142,Yes,Electroacoustic prototype for controlling the behaviour of marine mammals,"This proposal is prepared with the help of an Exploratory Award which included a Research Feasibility Study. This project addresses the problem of the interaction between marine mammals populations and human activities at sea. There is a large class of applications of marine technologies in which the control the behaviour of marine mammals can be very important in order to prevent their mortality. The scientific and technical objectives of this research proposal concern the implementation of an electroacoustic prototype for controlling the behaviour of some species of marine mammals, particularly dolphins, in their natural environment. In order to verify the efficiency and reliability of the acoustic prototypes we will consider mainly the applications to the fishery problems. Research is required into the study of the effects of different acoustic signals on the hearing apparatus of dolphins, which needs to be conducted by means of laboratory, dolphinarium and at sea experiments.  In particularly, the specific objectives are: - Theoretical evaluation of the Natural Frequencies of Resonance (NFR) of main components of the Rice-Transmitting System (RTS) of dolphins; - Tank experiments in order to measure the actual natural oscillations of the different components of dolphin RTS. Evaluation of the possible difference between the theoretical and experimental NFR. Structure definition of signal to be emitted by means of the acoustic prototype (choice of resonance signals or a combination of them plus anti-adaptive signals, aimed at disturbing the adaptation of dolphin to the repulsive calls).  Design and realisation of an experimental prototype to be used in the subsequent steps, and namely during tan k and floating cage experiments; - Floating cage and open sea experiments to evaluate the efficiency of selected signals on alive animals. Possible re-designing of structure of signals to be emitted; - Planning and production of a set of final series prototypes and their testing during real fishing actions to be conducted in different sea areas.",1,1

It aims at creating an information system, which incorporates environmental monitoring into predictive analysis of the status of fish resources for early inclusion in responsible fisheries management. The project is carried out as a retrospective analysis of environmental data, satellite data and fisheries data. Physical and biological models play significant role in the project.

796,209553,No,CArbon Production of under-ICE phytoplankton blooms in a changing Arctic Ocean,"Over the last decades, sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean (AO) has undergone unprecedented changes, with drastic decline in its extent, thickness and duration. Modern climate models are unable to simulate these changes, leading to large uncertainties in Arctic and Global Change predictions. Sea-ice strongly attenuates solar radiation and it is generally thought that phytoplankton, which drives Arctic marine CO2 sequestration, only grow in open waters once sea-ice retreats in spring. However, the discovery of large under-ice phytoplankton blooms (UIBs) growing beneath sea-ice contradicts this paradigm. UIB productivity in ice-covered regions has been suggested to be ten-fold larger than presently modeled. By initiating an international network (USA, France, Canada, Germany, Norway), the CAP-ICE project will acquire knowledge on the occurrence of UIBs, the physical mechanisms that control their initiation and productivity, and will quantify how UIBs affect the Arctic carbon cycle and climate. CAP-ICE will equally combine observational, modeling and novel technology approaches. Multiple pan-Arctic expeditions will provide new field observations on the environmental conditions controlling UIBs. Since UIBs are invisible to ocean color satellite sensors, developing a novel model adapted to under-ice environments will allow quantifying the contribution of UIBs to the Arctic carbon cycle. Finally, the recent launch of autonomous robotic platforms (Bio-Argo floats) will support the first assessment of UIB primary production and carbon export in AO and the implementation of a Bio-Argo Arctic network. These inter-disciplinary and innovative activities will establish a two-way exchange of knowledge between the researcher/fellow and the host institutions and enhance their European and international competitiveness. Outcomes of CAP-ICE will have an impact on the European strategy for global ocean observations, enhance European research excellence, and address a major societal challenge.",1,0
994,227256,No,MULTISCALE ANALYSIS OF PRECIPITATE IN Al-Cu ALLOYS,"Al-Cu alloys have a wide range of engineering applications due to their low density and high strength provide by a fine dispersion of nm-sized precipitates. The optimization of the mechanical properties of these alloys has been traditionally carried out through costly experimental “trial-and-error” approaches. In this project, a novel methodology is presented to determine the precipitate structure resulting from high temperature ageing and the resulting strength of the alloys from first principles calculations. The strategy is based in two main pillars. The first one is the determination of the Al-rich part of the Al-Cu phase diagram by means the construction of effective cluster expansion Hamiltonians that can extrapolate first-principles calculations in combination with statistical mechanics approaches based on Monte Carlo simulations to include the entropic contributions, enabling parameter-free predictions of the phase diagram. The second one is the combination of this information with phase field modeling to predict the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation and growth of precipitates during high temperature ageing and with molecular dynamics and dislocation dynamics simulations to predict the strengthening provided by the precipitates. The approach developed in this proposal will improve the predictive power of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering in Al-Cu alloys. The applicant will transfer her expertise and international connection in the field of multiscale modelling to the host institute. She will work with researchers of the host institution to prompt new areas of research that can attract new funding and receive regular training on transferable skills. All these activities will enlarge her portfolio of skills and will ensure further development of her career.",0,0
967,105937,No,Establishing and operating an Ocean Data Interoperability Platform,"Europe, the USA and Australia are making significant progress in facilitating the discovery and access of marine data through the development, implementation, population and operation of overarching distributed ocean and marine data observing and management infrastructures such as SeaDataNet, Geo-Seas, IOOS and the Australian Ocean Portal. All these regional and national developments are resulting in the implementation of standards for formats of metadata, data, and data products, quality control methods and flags, common vocabularies, as well as services for discovery, viewing and downloading, and software tools for editing, conversions, communication, analysis and presentation, that are increasingly adopted and used by their national and regional ocean and marine communities. There is also a general trend towards the use of the basic ISO and OGC standards, however these allow the use of different profiles and vocabularies. As a result there are differences in the standards used in the different regions which hinder their direct exchange and use at an international and global scale, and as a result act as a barrier to the realisation of global portals such as the IODE Ocean Data Portal and GEOSS.<br/>In order to remove impediments hindering the effective sharing of data across scientific domains and international boundaries, it is proposed to initiate and operate an Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) which will include all the major organisations engaged in ocean data management in EU, US and Australia. ODIP is also supported by the IOC-IODE who will participate in its implementation and operation. The ODIP platform will organise international workshops to foster the development of common standards and develop prototypes to evaluate and test selected potential standards and interoperability solutions.

1140,78611,No,Biodiversity impact assessment using species sensitivity scores,"Biodiversity indicators and monitoring frameworks are currently developed at global and European levels. A key tool for monitoring progress in achieving the EU target to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 is the recently endorsed set of EU headline biodiversity indicators. A requirement by the EU is to complement the indicator set and the development of biodiversity monitoring frameworks with tools that are able to assess the impacts from Community policies on biodiversity in a cost-effective way. The BioScore project satisfies this requirement by developing a tool for linking pressures from policy sectors to the (change of) state of biodiversity as measured by the presence and abundance of individual species. The tool will contain information on the ecological preferences of individual species, in relation to individual sectoral pressures and relating to selected Community policies as well as the EU headline biodiversity indicators. This tool will be applied for assessing impacts and effectiveness of Community policies based on historic data as well as for forecasting future impacts based on existing scenario studies. The BioScore tool will be integrated into existing biodiversity monitoring frameworks and incentives for uptake will be formulated. Also the database will be made freely accessible on the Internet. The specific objectives are to: - assemble the necessary knowledge-base for developing the tool; - build a cost-effective impact assessment tool in the form of a European species database with sensitivity scores; - apply the tool for the purpose of assessing the impacts of key drivers and pressures on biodiversity; - apply the tool for analysing the effectiveness of European policy responses; - apply the tool for modelling European-wide scenarios for selected drivers; - integrate the knowledge into a common monitoring framework to assess the impact of selected pressures on biodiversity; - propose incentives for a wide uptake of the tool.",1,0

590,63336,No,"Constructivist Mixed Reality for Design, Education, and Cultural heritage","CREATE (Constructivist Mixed Reality for Design, Education, and Cultural Heritage) aims to develop a mixed reality framework enabling highly interactive real-time construction and manipulation of realistic virtual worlds based on real sources. This framework will be tested and applied to two prototypes: a cultural heritage/education application, for students and the general public and an architectural/urban planning design review application, for decision makers and the general public. To develop these applications, the project follows a 'constructivist' approach, combining innovative work in VR, simulation, data capture, visualisation graphics, and interface design to provide highly realistic yet interactive experiences where users actively participate in the construction of environments. Development will be driven by actual user requirements, through careful analysis for each case, and evaluated for its effectiveness.  Objectives: In CREATE we will develop a mixed-reality framework that will enable interactive construction of virtual scenes based on real sources, resulting in highly realistic and interactive experiences. In particular: i) We will design new methodologies to determine user requirements based on a human-centred, 'constructivist' approach to working and learning, with special attention to evaluation; ii) We provide a complete set of techniques for a realistic capture of real sites, that can subsequently be used in an impressive virtual reality displays; iii) We will develop, adapt and combine novel, visualisation, display and audio technologies based on the user requirements, to enable realism with interactivity, specifically for VR/AR/MR applications. Finally, we will build & exploit two prototypes, one for a cultural heritage/learning application, and one for and architecture/urban-planning application, incorporating more natural and usable interface approaches.  Work description: The CREATE work plan consists of the project management and dissemination & exploitation work packages as well as five technical work packages: 1) Case Study Definition, Design and Methodology, to define and design the specifications and methodology for the two case studies, the first concerning a cultural heritage/education prototype and the other concerning a urban planning/design review prototype, and thus aid in their integration and the development; 2) Data Collection and Overall Scene Construction, to acquire existing site data forming the basis for construction and reconstruction for the case studies; 3) VE Enhancement: Re-lighting, Rendering, Population and Sound, to choose, adapt and develop appropriate algorithms and methodologies to enhance virtual environments so that they can provide a highly realistic experience while supporting interactive use;  4) Prototype Integration and Interface, to bring together the results of the techniques developed in the other work packages, and to design and implement the interface, creating a prototype system which will be used in the two application scenarios, for cultural heritage and urban planning. In this package, integration will be performed to provide a visual, haptic and audio experience to the user; 5) Evaluation, where the goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the performed work and the technical choices, with respect to the fulfilment of the objectives as set and targeted by each of the case studies/prototypes. The consortium will ensure timely and widespread dissemination of the results, both in the scientific community and to industry and the general public. The exploitation plan is twofold, first with the direct usage of the full prototypes by end-user partners or other take-up mechanisms and second the technology transfer of the individual technological breakthroughs developed, either for data capture or VE enhancement, in sectors such as VR, computer games, postproduction.  Milestones: - User requirements on Cultural Heritage/Education and on Urban/Architectural Planning & Design applications; - On-site data acquisition Techniques and Novel Algorithms with Digitally produced reconstructions of two sites; - Design & Specifications for VE Enhancement Algorithms; - Prototype mixing immerse technologies, and integration of the new virtual reality algorithms for realistic experience.",0,0
985,223964,No,Cancer Vaccines and Gut Microbiome: a rational approach to optimize  cancer immunotherapy,"This proposal intends to shed light on the interplay between cancer immunity and gut microbiome as a way to optimize personalized cancer vaccines and immunotherapy. The project originates from two milestone discoveries. First, to be effective cancer immunotherapies have to target CD4\/CD8\ T cell neo-epitopes, which originate from tumor mutations. Second, the gut microbiome influences the effectiveness of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody immunotherapy both in animal models and in humans. We also recently showed in a mouse model that oral gavages with Bifidobacterial cocktails improved the therapeutic power of neo-epitope-based cancer vaccines. How microbiome affects anti-cancer immunity has not been fully elucidated yet and a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms has the potential to substantially improve cancer immunotherapy. Since microbiome antigens are processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells and microbiome-induced T cells represent large fraction of the peripheral T cell repertoire, our hypothesis is that this large repertoire includes T cells which cross-react with cancer neo-epitopes (“molecular mimicry (MM)”). Depending upon the composition of gut microbiome, cross-reacting T cells can positively or negatively modulate anti-tumor immunity.  To demonstrate the role of MM in cancer immunity this project intends (i) to select the cross-reactive T cell epitopes as predicted by meta-omics analysis of gut microbiome and exome/transcriptome analysis of cancer cell lines, (ii) to formulate vaccines containing different combination of cross-reactive epitopes, and (iii) to test vaccine anti-tumor activities in normal mice, gnotobiotic mice and mice with engineered microbiome. The ultimate goals are: 1) to provide new criteria for neo-epitope selection in personalized cancer vaccines, 2) to develop prognostic tools based on microbiome analysis, and 3) to define microbial species to be used as immune-potentiators in patients undergoing cancer therapy.",0,0
1017,52758,No,Induction of pathogen resistance in fruit trees by transiently altering the flavonoid metabolism with specific enzyme inhibitors,"Apple and pear trees treated with the plant growth regulator prohexadione-ca are significantly less affected by fire blight (a bacterial disease) and by scab (caused by a fungus). Initial results indicate that prohexadione-ca, which is inactive as a bactericide or fungicide, transiently alters the sspectrum of endogenous flavonoids and related substances, thereby inducing natural resistance. The project aims at an in-depth elucidation of the under lying physiological, biochemical and molecular biological mechanisms. As a result, optimised methods for fire blight control, which are urgently needed particularly in pear -growing areas, and will become available. The disputed use of antibiotics to combat this disease will no longer be required. Likewise, the understanding of the new type of resistance mechanism will lead to new efficient, safe and environment friendly products for pathogen control in several further crop plants.",0,0
434,45704,No,Conveying metocean knowledge improvements onto shipping safety,"This programme is aimed at demonstrating to major segments of the marine industry the benefits that the incorporation of satellite-derived information on sea surface winds and waves might bring to their operations. The two main areas selected are ship certification and the transportation of very large loads such as dock cranes and offshore platforms. Attention will also be paid to the operation of high speed craft used in coastal ferries.  What these segments have in common is their comparative isolation from satellite data. Where historical information on sea state has been required to evaluate ship or platform performance, then meteorological hindcasting was (and is) the favoured means of supply. It is only very recently that an independent assessment made within the industry itself has concluded that statistics derived from satellite observations appear the more believable. Other commercial concerns are now more prepared to test their current method of operation against the satellite record and this is what will be attempted in this proposal.  There is another important aspect to the study. While it might be expected that almost twelve years of continuous surveillance of the sea surface from polar orbiting spacecraft would provide reliable statistical records of average and extreme conditions required for design planning, it is much less obvious that satellites could provide real-time updates on sea state frequently enough throughout the day to assist in routine operations. The opportunity will be taken in this programme to investigate the minimum requirements of the engaged marine operations. It should be possible, if there is sufficient interest from a number of major segments, to introduce a 'fast-delivery' mode on all wave measuring satellites operating now and in the future. In the final analysis there may be a case for desigrling a cluster of rnini-satellites designed specifically to broadcast information on sea state directly to ships and platforms at sea.  There are six partners in this programme. The two from the marine industries will guide the investigations in their own area of interest and adjudicate the results. Of the remaining four, one is a large marine research organization, one a university department specialising in the statistics of waves, one an engineering Metocean studies company, and the last a leading EO value-added company specialising in providing satellite-derived marine information.  The deliverables of the programme will be a set of Demonstration Models for each of the sectors, aimed to show the usefulness of satellite wind and wave data to assist in the daily operation and in the classification and assessment of ship safety over selected shipping routes.  The programme is scheduled to be completed within 30 months from kick-off and it is planned to post progress on the EWSE through the demonstration modules which will be updated at regular intervals as results are analysed.

1105,221908,No,Antarctic Cyclones: Expression in Sea Ice,"The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is an atmospheric low pressure system that sits over the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Variations in the position and strength of the ASL have a strong influence on Antarctic climate change, controlling both Antarctic sea-ice trends and ocean melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the classical view of the ASL as a large, smooth region of low pressure is misleading. The ASL is an average of many short-lived atmospheric cyclones, and the effect of the ASL on local climate is the highly non-linear net effect of these cyclones. ACES will investigate the role of the individual cyclones and their net effect on the changing climate of West Antarctica by achieving three main objectives: (1) Characterise the physics of cyclones by tracking them with machine learning algorithms in atmospheric re-analysis data and sea ice drift satellite observations. Elucidate cyclone-sea ice-ocean interactions using a model of individual cyclones. (2) Use the new understanding to improve a circum-Antarctic ice-ocean model, determining the effect of cyclone dynamics on hindcasts of ice shelf basal melting in West Antarctica. (3) Assess climate model representations of cyclone-sea ice-ocean interactions, enabling them to better represent past and future sea ice extent and future ice shelf basal melt rates. ACES will be the first attempt to comprehensively characterise the role of individual cyclones over sea ice. It will generate a solid physical understanding of cyclone-sea ice-ocean interactions, as well as improve past estimates of ice shelf basal melt rates and provide important feedback on the capability of climate models to represent Antarctic sea ice trends and ice shelf basal melt rates.",1,0
172,60097,Yes,Atlantic network of interdisciplinary moorings and timeseries for europe,"It is proposed to improve European scattered and uncoordinated ocean observing infrastructure for repeat/time series measurements, in order to provide an initial network of sustained moored stations for ocean CO_2 and carbon cycle measurements in the eastern North Atlantic. Existing infrastructure is upgraded/replaced with autonomous, state-of-the-art moored equipment for relevant CO_2, physical and biological measurements, at three carefully chosen sites. Part of the data will be telemetered in real-time. The three stations are tightly coordinated with the approved European ocean CO_2 system along 4 commercial ship lines, and are an essential component of a North Atlantic carbon observing system. OceanCO_2/carbon observations are imperative for understanding, monitoring, and predicting the oceanic uptake of anthropogenicCO_2. The improved infrastructure will thus provide access to strategic data for climate research and mitigation to European researchers and policy makers. At the same time, the moored platforms will be open to outside enhancements with additional sensors. Future extension of the network with more stations is encouraged.",1,1

The European Geothermal Project involved teams from France and Germany who collaborated to test a site in the Upper Rhine Valley for its suitability for terrestrial heat mining (hot dry rock (HDR) energy production). Some British scientists participated in specific tasks. The site was chosen near Soulz-sous-Forets in Alsace at the location of the old oil field of Pechelbronn which was the first oil field field exploited in Europe since the 18th century. It is situated on 1 of the summits of a very large thermic anomaly (200 km long and 20 km wide) where the mean geothermal gradient between the surface and 1500 m is known to be higher than 6.5 C/100 m. The programme began in July 1987 with a 2000 m deep borehole.  Below at 1375 m thick sediment cover, the granitic basement was penetrated to a depth of 2000 m. The temperature at the bottom of the hole was 140 C. The geothermal gradient within the sediments was unusually high (10 C per 100 m) and diminished to a normal after a series of fractures inside the Bundsandstein producing some water at 116 C with a total salinity 98 g/l. At the depth of 1820 m, hydraulically active natural fissure was reached. The artesian outflow from this zone was 0.15 l/s, with well head pressure of 1.6 bars. The thermal water produced from the well had a high chloride contents and clearly had an identical origin with the fluid collected from the Buntsandstein just above the granite. During the water injection tests, a second active natural fissure was detected normally closed out but which seemed to aquire a noticeable permeability at a well head pressure of about 40 bars. THE CONTRACT COVERS THE DRILLING AND TESTING OF A WELL TO PENETRATE AT LEAST 500 M INTO GRANITIC BASEMENT AT THE SITE OF THE KNOWN THERMAL ANOMALY AT SOULTZ. TD IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 1800 M.

530,216099,No,The construction of early modern global Cities and oceanic networks in the Atlantic: An approach via OceaN’s Cultural HeritAge,"CONCHA’s main goal is to explain the different ways port cities developed around the Atlantic rim from the late 15th and early 16th century in relation to differing global, regional, and local ecological and economic environments. This analysis will be framed around a distinction between two separate navigational systems that existed in the Atlantic during the age of sail (1400-1800): the equatorial passage and the North Atlantic passage. Speaking to different literatures on port cities in the Atlantic, and environmental history, CONCHA aims to produce an Atlantic history of seaports in which the ocean – its ecosystems and species – is included as a dynamic player. CONCHA analyses the history of seaports using historical data as well as geomorphological, environmental, and archaeological studies. As case studies, CONCHA uses different locations in Northern Europe, North America, Iberia, the Atlantic archipelagos, Brazil and Colombia, which were central nodes in the circulation of people, resources, and knowledge in the early modern Atlantic world. Academically, one purpose of CONCHA is to provide, through academic exchange and participation in research missions, highly specialized training to senior and junior scholars and technicians from the different institutions and countries involved in the project. Another important objective of CONCHA is to develop historical knowledge for heritage purposes. Besides organizing academic workshops and publications, therefore, CONCHA aims to educate by involving the public in historical research by offering lecture series and exhibitions, and by assisting public institutions in the development of heritage conservation and tourism.",0,0
763,74284,No,Remotely Operated Tanker Inspection System II (ROTIS II),"The disasters of ERIKA on December 1999 and PRESTIGE last November have put once more in evidence the importance of periodic ship inspection and credibility of such assessment. To date, maritime vessel inspection is based on: (a) close-up visual inspection and (b) steel plate thickness measurements. Prior to inspection a ship must be made fully available at the harbour area, all access spaces must be made safe (de-gassed etc) and prepared accordingly, often in dry dock, thus resulting in a considerable ship idle time and, consequently, a significant cost. In the case of big, double hull tankers it can easily amount to multiples of $100,000.The introduction of double hull vessels is widely seen as the response to the need of preventing maritime catastrophes such as the one of the PRESTIGE oil tanker. However, to be effective, it must be coupled with measures towards more efficient and cost effective inspection procedures. Adequate tools must be provided to the surveyors, ship owners, as well as to state and port authorities providing them with the capacity to perform, through diagnostic or tale-operated equipment, rapid but safe and reliable inspections. The object of the present proposal is the follow-up of the successful ROTIS project (completed in June2002). Based on the experience and the sound basis of the first prototype, it aims at the specification, design and implementation of a new ROTIS II prototype that will meet all the requirements of the endures as well as the particular safety and operational specifications. More in particular, ROTIS II project will cover a significant research effort to: *) Correct / meet certain technical issues identified on the first ROTIS prototype (in particular its size and shape). *) Significantly enhance all ROTIS functionalities implementing advanced control techniques to automate certain tasks, incorporating advanced supervisory techniques that will integrate all available sensor#",0,0
944,221871,No,Understanding and leveraging ‘moments of change’ for pro-environmental behaviour shifts,"Responding to climate change requires profound changes to individual behaviour. However, much of our behaviour is habitual, which is resistant to change. Habits are cued by stable contexts (i.e., same time, place and/or social group), so when these change, habits are disrupted, providing an opportunity to intervene to foster pro-environmental behaviour. ‘Moments of change’ are when individual life circumstances shift within a short time frame, and include biographical and exogenous changes (e.g., becoming a parent, travel disruption). The relationship between moments of change and environmental impact is complex, with heterogeneity between individuals, cultures and behaviours. The aim of this proposal is to examine how ambitious lifestyle change might be achieved through understanding and harnessing ‘moments of change’ in life circumstances. This project integrates insights from several fields (developmental and environmental psychology, sociology, science & technology studies) to bring a much-needed focus on the temporal and socio-technical dimensions of pro-environmental behaviour (change). There are two objectives for the research: (a) To explore and track moments of pro-environmental behaviour change across cultures and life-course; and (b) To examine the efficacy of behavioural interventions targeted to moments of change. Three work packages address these objectives through an ambitious programme of cross-cultural research using secondary and big data analyses, longitudinal qualitative interviews and panel surveys to explore moments of change, and experimental studies to test behaviour change interventions targeted at moments of change (e.g., starting university, retiring, relocating). This project promises a step-change in understanding the dynamics of pro-environmental change across the life course and cultures, and the development of robust habit-disrupting interventions to foster lifestyle change.",0,0

Using fruitfully, human and mouse genetics we shall analyse the biochemical, cellular and physiological functions of CRB1, its family members and CRB1-interacting-proteins (Caps). We shall analyse the retinal degeneration in mouse models for RP12 and LCA. We will generate gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide microarray analysis to determine the cellular and molecular changes during the onset of the neurosensory disease. We expect to deliver lent viral gene therapy vectors to prevent the onset of RP12 and LCA.",0,0
338,198297,No,ANtibioticS and mobile resistance elements in WastEwater Reuse applications: risks and innovative solutions,"In response to the increasing problem of water shortage, the reuse of treated urban wastewater is considered the most suitable and reliable alternative for sustainable water management and agricultural development. In spite of the benefits associated with this practice, major concerns currently exist, related to the adverse effects regarding chemical and biological contaminants of emerging concern such as antibiotics and mobile antibiotic resistance elements such as antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes. These are now considered as a serious public health problem by various international organizations and the European Commission, because of their spread in the environment, the food chain, drinking water, etc. To tackle these problems, scientists with an interdisciplinary research/training background are urgently needed. This ETN will train a new generation of ESRs to address the risks associated with such contaminants and wastewater reuse. Innovative chemical, microbiological, toxicological and modelling tools, and novel process engineering will form the scientific and training core of their innovative research projects and training. The project will contribute to understanding the fate and transmission of antibiotics and resistance from wastewater to the environment and humans, through soil, ground/surface water and crops. Relevant ELVs will be determined, essential for the development and implementation of regulatory frameworks. This project directly tackles these aspects, by bringing together a multidisciplinary research team, with the private sector, and policy makers and through communication activities towards stakeholders and the wider public.",0,0
572,30824,No,Study of the Indirect and Direct Influences on Climate of Anthropogenic Trace Gas Emissions,"To improve the understanding of the direct and indirect climate inluences of anthropogenic trace species in the atmosphere.     The main focus is on the estimation and explanation of changes in atmospheric chemistry and consequent climate forcings caused by radiatively active gases and aerosols.   The project is a combined effort by researchers in the field of atmospheric chemistry and climate modelling, and is building upon the collaboration and results obtained during the first SINDICATE project.   The chemistry general circulation model ECHAM, which includes troposphere and stratosphere descriptions of higher hydrocarbon and heterogeneous chemistry schemes, descriptions of aerosol formation, growth and removal processes, and a radiation scheme to calculate radiative forcings, will be further developed.   The off-line transport/chemistry model TM2 will likewise be further developed. The model uses ECMWF and ECHAM calculated meteorological fields, and is extended to include higher hydrocarbon and heterogeneous chemistry schemes, descriptions of aerosol formation, growth and removal processes, and a radiation scheme to calculate climate forcings.   A 'Zoom' model of TM2 model (1 by 1 horizontal resolution) will be developed for use on regional scales (e. g. Europe) for comparison with data from measurin campaigns and relatively dense monitoring networks.   The ECHAM and TM2 models will be validated by systematic comparisons between calculated and observed concentrations of NMHC, CH4, NOx, CO, SO2, and the reaction products ozone, sulfate and nitrate.   Based on these developments direct and indirect climate forcings for changing concentrations of NMHC, CH4, CFCs, N2O, NOx, CO and SO2 will be calculated. The climate responses from changing NMHC, CH4, CFCs, N2O, NOx , CO, and SO2 emissions and concentrations for the period from 1880 to present will be established and compared with observed trends in temperature, precipitation and trace gas concentrations.   The impact of the Pinatubo eruption on the concentration of stratospheric ozone and the effects on the temperature and the circulation in the stratosphere will be calculated and compared with observations.",0,0
958,35552,No,Biogeochemical Interactions between the Danube River and the North-Western Black Sea,"EROS (European River Ocean System) is a long term interdisciplinary research project on biogeochemical processes in the European coastal environment. EROS 21 is a contribution to the Eloïse integrated networking initiative and will focus on the interactions between the Danube, Dnestr and Dnepr rivers and the North Western Black Sea. It constitutes a follow up of the ongoing Pilot project 'EROS 2000 - The interactions between the Danube river and the North Western Black Sea (1994-1996)' This area, indeed, corresponds to the largest catchment basin of european rivers, and represents one of the ultimate example of deterioration of the coastal marine environment, where dramatic eutrophication, pollution and erosion problems are observed. The extrapolation of the results obtained in this area will be of great value for determining measures to be taken to prevent such catastrophic situation in other semienclosed seas. It further represents a key environment for understanding the production of biogases of climatological significance such as methane. The geographical area under study is roughly the North-Western Black Sea continental shelf (offshore limit at the 200 m isobath, from Sebastopol to Burgas) but processes whose understanding requires and extension of the domain are examined at the appropriate scale (e.g. sediment dispersion, methane seepage, hydrodynamical circulation...).  The scientific objectives are adressed by the four following key questions, which also determine the structure of the project:  1. What would be the consequences of a reduction of the river input of nutrients for the eutrophication and the ecosystem structure of the NorthWestern Black Sea ?  2. What are the rivererine and atmospheric sources, levels and fates of key organic/inorganic contaminants in the North-Western Black Sea environment ? 3. What are likely to be the short - and long - term consequences of the regulation of river discharge for sediment erosion, transport, deposition and water stratification ?  4. What is the significance of the Black sea as a source of important greenhouse gases?  The implementation of the project associates both E.U. countries and counterpart participants from Russia, the Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria. The project methodology involves the following items:  - analysis of existing data in the riparian countries and their banking - field work (survey data and process studies)  - numerical experimentations (coupled hydrodynamical/biogeochemical models) - training (transfer of techniques and protocols).  An important part of the work carried out during the 2 year-Pilot phase (1994- 1996) is being devoted to research planning between Eastern and Western European scientists and institutions so as to implement the monitoring network needed for change assessment and model validation and for the selection of eastern research vessels according to planned research requirements. These difficulties are now circumvented and several cruises are planned in the Danube River and its Delta (June 1995) and on the shelf (July 1995 and March 1996). The Pilot project received a financial support from the Environment and PECO Programmes, from the Danube Task Force and from the INTAS Association. However, due to the limited funding available, the scientific plan of the Pilot phase can partly adressed the defined four key questions and is restricted to the geomorphological analysis of the Danube watershed and to the identification of the point and non-point sources of nutrients; to the establishment of the 1D ecosystem model as based on the analysis of existing and collected biogeochemical data; to the assessment of contaminant levels, sediment transfer and location of main biogas seepage.  The present proposal is structured to fully address the scientific objectives determined by the four key environmental questions.with a view to contributing to the restoration of sustainable fisheries, to facilitate compliance with environmental quality criteria, including recreational aspects, and to evaluating the significance of the Black Sea in terms of global change",1,0
798,103338,No,Controls on Megathrust Earthquake Segmentation,"Great subduction earthquakes (with a moment Magnitude of Mw >8) rupture an area of a few thousand square kilometres along a convergent continental margin with coseismic slip up to some tens of meters. However, at certain locations along the continental margin earthquake rupture is suddenly arrested. The spatial extent of the rupture area controls the magnitude of the earthquake and therefore its destructiveness. The recent powerful megathrust earthquakes in Sumatra (2004, 2005), Chile (2010) and Japan (2011) showed that the factors that control extent and limitations of rupture during such earthquakes are highly complex and thus only poorly understood at the moment. This holds true, although the phenomenon of earthquake segmentation has been observed for decades and in spite of the socio-economic impact of this type of earthquake and their associated tsunamis. The overall aim of this project is to increase the understanding of factors that control the area and extent of earthquake rupture and by this also the magnitude of the earthquake. Marine seismic and bathymetry data across earthquake segment boundaries worldwide will be analyzed in order to document structural and morphological variations of the upper overriding and the lower subducting plate which impact on or reflect changes in the physical properties of the plate interface and thus control earthquake segmentation. The output will be an improved understanding of earthquake segmentation at active continental margins. This, in turn, is beneficial for global hazard assessment and mitigation efforts in regions that expect powerful subduction earthquakes in the future.",0,0
745,107550,No,On-line Control of Drawing and Blanking Processes and of Quality of the Product by Fusion of Sensors and Artificial Vision Techniques,"Forming processes and, in particular, sheet metal punching and deep drawing are inherently quite unstable manufacturing processes. On one hand, a slight change in the production parameters or in the material quality are usually enough to get the process out of its stability condition and to produce bad parts. On the other hand, when a tooling breakage or excessive wear occurs, the resulting parts are also bad. This situation is specially difficult to detect when producing small size parts, often manufactured in large quantities using high speed and production rate equipment. As a result, production of bad parts goes on until a statistical control is able to detect this and to stop the machine. The main objective of this project is to develop a complete control system to be fitted on the ensemble press - tooling in order to assure a zero-defect in forming industries consecrated to the manufacturing of small size workparts.  The aim is to get a complete diagnosis and control over the quality of the production and of the state of the production goods. As a result, the control system has to be able to integrate the capabilities of state-of-the-art control systems for forming processes and to fulfil the new objective of complete control of the quality of the part. Two complementary methods are considered: use of Acoustic Emission (AE) and load measurement technologies, which includes a sensor set mounted on the press and the tooling, the electronic needed for the conditioning and a monitoring system installed on a PC, and Artificial Vision (AV) system, which is composed by a set of cameras and a flexible image processing system for the detection of defects in real time. The information of both systems is analysed by a software based control system, installed on the same PC, which has to decide the changes in the press state, the tooling condition or the process parameters needed to avoid the occurrence of defects.",0,0
18,57245,Yes,Structure and role of biological communities involved in the transport and transformation of persistent pollutants at the marine air-water interface (AIRWIN),"The aim of the project is to investigate the structure of biological communities living and growing in the sea surface microlayer (SML), and their role in the transport and cycling of natural organic matter and xenobiotics. This research proposal will provide original data on the identification of organisms living in the SML. It will provide both scientific and biotechnological communities with a collection of organisms with information on: i) their role in the transformation of specific pollutants and; ii) their capacity to produce molecules such asantioxydants which may be used for pharmaceutical applications. The sensitivity of SML organisms to different categories and concentrations of toxic compounds will be assessed to determine if they are suitable bioindicators of atmospheric pollution. The AIRWIN Project provide significant information on the structure and functioning of the sea surface microlayer (SML) as well as a collection of environmental bacterial strains. The SML occurs at least 30-40% of the time at the open global ocean, but its occurrence can be higher in coastal regions were wind speeds are lower. In the Mediterranean Sea, the SML occurs mainly from late spring to early fall and, therefore, is a compartment to be taken into account from the standpoint of the inhabiting biological communities and their role in the transport and cycling of natural organic matter and xenobiotics. An original and interesting result was the comparison of microbial food webs operating at the surface microlayer with those operating in underlying waters. Recommendations were addressed for optimizing the sampling of the surface microlayer. We showed that both, bacterial and phytoplanktonic cells, accumulate in the surface microlayer by the passive and physical process of flotation, with an important part of senescent cells associated with degraded pigments. This interesting result address new questions on the potential influence of the surface microlayer on satellite data used to estimate primary production at the oceanic scale and this should be investigated in the future in different oligotrophic areas of oceans where contrasting situations may be encountered in the pigment concentration of SML and subsurface layers. The surface microlayer of the sea represents the boundary layer between the atmosphere and the sea. There, hydrophobic compounds are accumulating, both naturally occurring and of anthropogenic origin.  Microorganisms present in this layer are degrading these compounds along with ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Although we shown that a lot of bacterial species have developed very efficient mechanisms for DNA repair and if we except a few highly resistant species which were isolated in the SML, the bacterioneuston are apparently not specifically adapted to these high radiation levels. From an evolutionary point of view, it seems likely that this particular microenvironment is sufficiently stable to allow the development of specific (i.e., endemic) microbial communities. Thus, there is no indication that microorganisms inhabiting this microhabitat are specifically suited to degrade anthropogenically introduced compounds. It appears that solar radiation is more efficient in cleaving aromatic or hydrophobic compounds in this microlayer than the neuston biota. Therefore, anthropogenic compounds potentially introduced to the surface microlayer via the atmosphere or via direct release into the sea should be designed to be photosensitive so that they can be photolytically cleaved. An important collection of environmental bacterial strains was developed and more than one hundred of different bacterial species were isolated, purified and stored in this collection. This collection represents an interesting output of the project for the European community at the time of development of genomic and proteomic studies. Some of these species should be of interest for biotechnological and bioremediation applications but this need further investigations to better characterize their physiological and metabolic properties.  The field work carried out within AIRWIN has demonstrated the enrichment of organic contaminants (e.g. PCBs, PAHs, NP, etc.) and heavy metals (e.g. Pb, Cu and Zn) in the sea surface microlayer, as an organic carbon driven process, both in the dissolved and particulate phases. In this respect, the trophic status of the coastal waters will determine the partitioning of xenobiotics between the particulate, colloidal and truly dissolved phases, which has important implications in assessing the corresponding bioavailability. POC explains the SML enrichment of PCBs and organochlorinated pesticides, which tends to be higher than in the dissolved phase. However, for the PAHs higher enrichments were found, suggesting that PAH partitioning is constrained not only by the organic carbon content of the particles but also by the particular form of this carbon. Presumably, soot carbon concentrations are higher in the SML due to accumulation of atmospherically deposited aerosol in the SML. The occurrence of SML seems to be a very important driver enhancing dry deposition fluxes. This is true mainly for accumulation mode aerosols. The effect of a SML with lower surface tension and higher hydrophobicity would enhance the collision efficiency of aerosols to the air-water interface. The field work, in combination with the modelling task, has evidenced that coastal regions are characterized by important net volatilization fluxes of POPs such as PAHs, NPs and PCBs. Conversely, net absorption fluxes are observed at open sea.",1,1
307,41336,No,Developments in the management of human resources in Austria and Sweden - cases from the banking and electronic industries,"The aim of this study is to examine developments in the management of human resources in Austria and Sweden. Key research questions are: - what Human Resource Management (HRM) approaches are pursued by companies operating in Austria and Sweden?, -what outcomes in terms of employment growth do different HRM approaches pursued by companies in Austria and Sweden have?, -is EU membership leading to a destabilisation or shaking up of the Austrian or Swedish system of HRM? -is there any development towards a unitarist US type HRM in Austrian or Swedish companies?  The research consists of a secondary analysis of survey results, expert interviews and eight detailed case studies of human resource practises of banks and electronic companies.  On a practical level the results of the research project can give policy advise to Austrian and Swedish employers about the applicability of US HRM prescriptions and the viability of more traditional human resource approaches. EU policy makers will get insights into the way European integration affects human resource management practises, as well as possible links between HRM practises and employment levels. In addition, the results will contribute to the academic debate about the convergence or divergence of human resource practises in Europe as well as the suitability of American management concepts for companies operating in Europe.",0,0
177,110317,Yes,Responses to coastal climate change: Innovative Strategies for high End Scenarios -Adaptation and Mitigation-,"Coastal areas concentrate vulnerability to climate change due to high levels of population, economic activity and ecological values. Because of that RISES-AM- addresses the economy-wide impacts of coastal systems to various types of high-end climatic scenarios (including marine and riverine variables). It encompasses analyses from global to local scales across the full range of RCPs and SSPs. It considers the still significant uncertainties in “drivers” (physical and socio-economic) and coastal system responses (e.g. land loss or uses, biological functions, economic productivity) within a hazard-vulnerability-risk approach. The emphasis is on the advantages of flexible management with novel types of coastal interventions (e.g. “green” options) within an adaptive pathway whose tipping points will be identified/quantified in the project. The assessment of impacts and adaptation deficits will be based on modelling tools that will provide a set of objective and homogeneous comparisons. The extended/improved suite of models will be applied across scales and focusing on the most vulnerable coastal archetypes such as deltas, estuaries, port cities and small islands. This will lead to a motivated analysis of the synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, including what level and timing of climate mitigation is needed to avoid social, ecological and economic adaptation tipping points in coastal areas. We shall evaluate the direct and indirect costs of high-end scenarios (e.g. the increasing demand for safety under increasingly adverse conditions) for coasts with/without climate change and contribute to determining which policy responses are needed at the European and global levels in the context of international climate discussions. The project will finally transfer results to authorities, users and stakeholders from all economic sectors converging in coastal zones, including the climate research community dealing with more generalistic assessments.",1,1
813,82126,No,Quantitative analysis of lipid oxidation in functional food ingredients containing N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Variables to be controlled in order to guarantee high quality and safety,"Changes in human dietary habits derived from changes in lifestyle have led to a relative deficiency of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in developed countries. Overall, the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA in the modern diet is as high as 20-25:1 instead of the ideal ratio of 4-10:1. Nowadays, efforts are being directed to incorporate n-3 PUFA in foods rather than be used solely as a dietary supplement. Development of foods fortified in these essential fatty acids is emerging in order to allow increased dietary intakes with little change in dietary habits.  However, such fortification presents challenging limitations, as these lipid substrates are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation. Further, the growing development of these products contrasts, however, with the lack of analytical methods suitable for quality control, in particular, concerning the formation of oxidation compounds.  This project is aimed at contributing to the improvement of quality and safety of functional food ingredients containing n-3 PUFA by studying two specific aspects considered of priority interest: 1) Quantification of oxidation compounds formed during manufacturing and storage. Quantitative analysis of total oxidised triacylglycerols (TAG) and their distribution in three main groups of compounds, namely TAG polymers, TAG dimers and oxidised TAG monomers will be performed. In addition, specific determination of the altered acyl groups of the oxidised TAG molecules by a rapid analytical method will be developed. 2) Definition of the action of those variables to be modified and/or controlled to guarantee high quality and safety. It will be focused on those variables determining the contact of the lipids with oxygen, as a very low amount of oxygen is sufficient in heterogeneous lipid systems for development of off-flavours. Among the variables determining oxygen availability, the amount of occluded air, lipid surface area and oxygen permeability will be studied and optimised.",0,0
213,51274,Yes,Monitoring biodiversity of pico-phytoplankton in marine waters,"Problems to be solved. Picoplankton (defined operationally as cells that pass through a 3 micron filter) dominate the photosynthetic biomass in many marine ecosystems, not only in the very oligotrophic regions of the world oceans, such as the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, but also in mesotrophic areas. However, picophytoplankton are clearly not exclusively restricted to pelagic environments. In many coastal regions, they are present throughout the year and constitute a 'background' population, onto which episodic phenomena such as the spring bloom develops. In some environments, such as coastal lagoons, picoplankton can be a major component of biomass and productivity for most of the year. In addition, some bloom-forming picoplankters such as Aureococcus spp. are toxic. However, to date fewer than 30 species of picophytoplankton have been described. A clear proof of our poor knowledge of picophytoplankton diversity is revealed by the discovery of three novel algal classes in the last ten years described from picophytoplanktonic taxa. Because so little is known about the taxonomy and systematics of picophytoplankton we have very little data to estimate the levels of its biodiversity under natural conditions and how picophytoplankton are affected by environmental variability linked to either anthropogenic influence or to larger scale phenomena such as those linked to climate change or global warming. Scientific objectives and approach. The major objective of this project is to develop, test and validate probing methods based on molecular biology techniques that allow for routine and extensive assessment of picophytoplankton diversity (species composition and relative contribution of taxa to total community) in the marine environment. Our strategy to meet this objective is encapsulated in the following four steps: (1) Obtain SSU rDNA sequences for as many as possible picophytoplankton taxa from both cultures and natural samples. Novel taxa will be assessed using a combination of methods including in particular pigment analysis and electron microscopy. (2) Using this sequence database, develop hierarchical probes recognizing each taxonomic group having picophytoplanktonic representatives (3) Develop fast and efficient techniques to quantify the fraction of the pico-phytoplankton recognized by the probes in natural samples. (4) Test and validate these probes on time series of picophytoplankton biodiversity in three coastal ecosystems. Expected impacts The expected impacts of our project fall into four categories. Understanding marine systems. Picophytoplankton forms the base of the food web in most marine systems. The large-scale picture that will result from our project should lead to the identification and isolation of some of the key organisms in this size class. Future studies could then focus on these taxa to understand their physiology, their genetic diversity, their population dynamics and more generally their exact role in the ecosystem. Monitoring marine systems. The tools and methods we intend to develop and validate will offer near real-time capabilities to monitor key biological components of marine systems because they rely on very recent developments in molecular biology such as the DNA chips or large-scale gene sequencing. It is obvious that by the end of the project, better, faster, and less expensive instruments and technologies will be available to take advantage of the probes we will have developed. Biotechnology. Although still used on a very small scale, microalgae are clearly an excellent material for many future biotechnology applications. Among microalgae, the smaller size classes constituted by picophytoplankton are potentially very attractive targets for several reasons such as the existence of many new phyla not yet investigated or their ease of culture. Research in biology. Picoplankton offer many fascinating aspects that could be targeted in the future for fundamental studies in many fields of biology. As an example, their very small cell and genome sizes raise the question of how they evolve to function in a somewhat complex and changing environment with the smallest possible number of genes.",1,1
548,104397,No,Developing a biological network approach to quantify indirect costs and benefits of natural ecosystems to tropical agriculture,"Ecosystem services (ES) have risen to prominence as a motivation for conserving biodiversity.  The role of biodiversity in ES is however complex and depends on the intricate ways in which the components of ecosystems interact.  We have long been aware that “tinkering” with one part of an ecosystem can have unforeseen consequences elsewhere in that system, as effects are transmitted through the network of biological interactions. Advances in network theory, and empirical studies, are now providing insight into how these complex ecological systems operate, and how influencing one part of a network can have consequences for the entire system.   NETWORK will bring together scientist with expertise in the empirical (UK), theoretical (France) and applied (South Africa) aspects that are required to make the transition from fundamental ecology to practice possible. It will focus on a proof-of-concept case study on the interactions between mango plantations and surrounding natural ecosystems. Natural vegetation near farmland can sustain populations of natural enemies of pest insects and of pollinators and thereby provide an important ecosystem service but can also be a source of the pest insects themselves (as farmers believe is the case in the mango system). A dynamic ecological network approach will be employed in this project to quantify these opposing effects in an important tropical crop (mango) under different management conditions. The project will be one of the first studies to take an in-depth ecological look at the tradeoffs between ES and the costs of natural systems, by studying the dynamics of, and interactions between, all the component species in the network.  This will give insight into the quantitative effect of the natural ecosystem on crop production, and the development of methodology for testing alternative management strategies in silico to aid informed decision making.",0,0
927,206071,No,MagnetIc NOzzle thruster with elecTron cyclOtron Resonance,"MINOTOR’s strategic objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of the ECRA technology as a disruptive game-changer in electric propulsion, and to prepare roadmaps paving the way for the 2nd EPIC call, in close alignment with the overall SRC-EPIC strategy. Based on electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) as the sole ionization and acceleration process, ECRA is a cathodeless thruster with magnetic nozzle, allowing thrust vectoring. It has a considerable advantage in terms of global system cost, where a reduction of at least a factor of 2 is expected, and reliability compared to mature technologies. It is also scalable and can potentially be considered for all electric propulsion applications, from microsatellites to space tugs.  Although the first results obtained with ECRA have been encouraging, the complexity of the physics at play has been an obstacle for the understanding and development of the technology. Thus an in-depth numerical and experimental investigation plan has been devised for the project, in order to bring the technology from TRL3 to TRL5. The strong consortium is composed of academic experts to perform the research activities on ECRA, including alternative propellants, along with experienced industrial partners to quantify its disruptive advantages on the propulsion subsystem and its market positioning. ECRA’s advantages as an electric thruster technology can be a disruptive force in a mostly cost-driven satellite market. It would increase European competitiveness, help develop low-cost satellite missions such as constellations, provide end-of-life propulsion, and pave the way for future emerging electric propulsion technologies.

701,197417,No,Navigational Decision Support System for Improved COLREGs Safety Management,"The NAVDEC project focuses on our innovative marine navigation system, using modern IT and ICT technologies to perform decision support functions by processing and integrating data from other navigation information systems to assess the situation and work out solutions to avoid collisions at sea. This is important because human error is the main causes of maritime accidents, and due to the high cost of marine accidents (damage to ship, cargo, injuries and pollution), the potential market for this type of systems is broad, including ship owners, ship builders, equipment manufacturers, classification societies and insurance companies. Potential system users are ship officers and sailors of over 77 thousand merchant vessels worldwide and many times more sailing and motor boats, as well as training centres. A higher level of navigational safety provided by NAVDEC’s new functionalities will reduce the risk of accidents and generate material benefits due to lower loss of cargo and ships, as well as marine environment protection and prevention of ecological disasters, and social benefits due to safer work conditions on marine vessels.

224,64678,Yes,Monitoring illicit discharges,"Specific Objectives  Mapping of illicit oil spill pollution activity and generation of reliable spatio-temporal statistics of oil spill occurrences in the European seas.  - Assess on the possibilities for early warning and prompt response for identifying polluter, taking into account specific area characteristics. Development of an integrated approach to reconstruct spilling scenario and associate illegal discharges with ship tracks detected in the pollution zone.  - Identify areas facing chronic pollution from operational discharges, and investigate prevailing met-ocean features, which may enhance consequences of frequent spilling. Assess on the efficiency of the existing legal frame for protecting such areas and the coastal communities and investigate possibilities for improvements e.g. accordance to SSA (Specifically Sensitive Areas). Planned Deliverables  1. Maps of regional and local reconnaissance of illicit discharges incidences in the European seas for 2000 and 2001;  2. Database of detected oil spill signatures and reliable statistical assessments integrated to GIS with indicators of environmental sensitivity and other relevant information;  3. Assessment at regional level of the extent of unconformity with regulations (1999-2001);  4. Methodology for reconstructing spilling history and responsible ships identification;  5. Web based services for results visualization and dissemination.  Specific deliverables to DGs:  Deliverables 1, 2 , 3 and 5  As a result of the research:  Deliverable 4  Summary of deliverables made by: - Summary of deliverables 2001 31/12/2001  - Mapping of illicit oil spill pollution for year 1999 over the all Mediterranean basin;  - Presentation of the results in the first meeting of the Management Committee on Marine Pollution (MCMP);  - Production, in collaboration with DG-ENV Civil Protection Unit, of the document 'On the Monitoring of Illicit Vessel Discharges. A Reconnaissance Study in the Mediterranean Sea'.  Output Indicators and Impact  On the basis of the activities already carried out, expected results will represent a unique source of valuable information quantifying the problem of illicit discharges and will provide substantial support for setting up actions to combat and help to abate the problem. Important results will include:  - Provision of updated and comprehensive information on the real dimension of the problem at European level; - Provision of an effective tool to evaluate the level of unconformity to regulations; - Provision of a tool for monitoring the effectiveness of the existing legal frame and possible amendments and the effectiveness of real actions and activities taken to combat the problem; - Support to the optimisation of surveillance systems to identify the polluters; - Support to the design of an early warning system for prompt response. Summary of the project  Besides accidental pollution, caused by ships in distress, different types of routine ship operations lead to deliberate discharges of oil in the sea. Illicit discharges are the greater source of marine pollution from ships, and the one, which poses an insidious long-term threat to the marine and coastal environment. - The answer of the international community to the problem of marine pollution from ships, is the MARPOL 73/78 convention, which sets strict standards for ship discharges. Europe is especially privileged by this regulation, since all its regional seas are now accorded the status of 'Special Sea Area' where discharges are almost totally prohibited. - This project aims to provide updated information on the extent of unconformity with the international environmental law in order to assist the Commission Services and the European States in assessing on the effectiveness of the existing policies, as well as for optimising plans of focused patrol and intervention strategies. - The work will be based on the best available remote sensing techniques and methodologies and in particular on radar technologies. Systematic work will be carried out for generating reliable spatio-temporal statistics of oil discharges from ships in the European seas. Spill signature shapes and contrast characteristics will be studied through simulations, while the positioning and classification possibilities of ship tracks and their movement in the pollution zone will be investigated, for reconstructing scenarios of discharging and proposing methodologies for polluter identification. Areas under high pressure will be identified, and investigations will be carried out, of the prevailing met-ocean features, which may enhance locally the risks and consequences of frequent spilling. Assessments on the recurrence of law violation will be accomplished at regional and local scale, while the possibilities/limitations for early warning and law enforcement will be investigated including views related to TSS (Traffic Separation Schemes) and AIS (Automatic Identification System transponders).  Rationale  Reliable monitoring methodologies and continuously updated comprehensive information are key elements to create effective contingency planning, that is the firm technical foundation, for civil protection and mitigation of social and economical impacts, from man-made risks. Systematic inclusion also of state of the art scientific findings, in regional and international environmental governance, secures the collective action on environmentally justified principles, and prevents compromising policies for short-term gains.",1,1
295,206238,No,"Flexible Heat and Power, Connecting heat and power networks by harnessing the complexity in distributed thermal flexibility.","The annual space heating and cooling energy consumption in Europe is almost 3,500TWh. In 2012, in EU28 the electricity consumption ratio was around the 20% of the total energy consumption, from which 30% was consumed in the residential and 30% in the services sectors. From these proportions, air conditioning represents 17% of the total electricity consumption in the EU27 residential buildings. In the EU tertiary sector the electric space and water heating system represent 19.22%, the ventilation 12.47%, the commercial refrigeration 8.57% and the air conditioning 2.86% of the buildings electricity consumption. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system’s electricity consumption of a building can represent between the 30% and 40% of the total energy consumption. The inertia of these power to heat solutions constitute an enormous potential for electric flexibility usable for absorbing the excess of renewable generation and avoiding curtailment while managing local power congestion, voltage stability in the grid and avoiding reversal power flows, as well as minimizing RES production imbalance. That is, DER with thermal inertia can provide services to RES owners, grid operators, aggregators and actors on the power market, while saving energy in the buildings. In fact, flexibility harnessing using heat to power solutions enables to deploy large-scale renewable throughout Europe successfully. The Flexible Heat and Power (FHP) project will develop a Power-to-Heat (and Cooling) solution package that manages this complexity through an easily accessible interface aimed at buildings and power grid actors. A practical prototype will be developed and deployed in two different demonstration scenarios in The Netherlands and Sweden representing diverse parts of the European power grid. FHP has the potential to provide total thermal flexibility with the aim of increasing the share of renewables by 22% over the total electric consumption from current technical limits (40%).",0,0
1043,220215,No,THE FIRST EFFECTIVE BIOCIDE-FREE ENVIRONMENTALLY-HARMLESS ANTIFOULING COATING FOR THE BOATING INDUSTRY,"Boat hulls submerged in both sea- and fresh-water environments are gradually colonised by natural organisms, a process called biofouling. Biofouling represents a significant problem for boat and ship operations, as it damages hulls, increases water drag leading to loss of manoeuvrability, delays in shipping and increased fuel consumption, inevitably increasing greenhouse emissions by up to 40%. Current antifouling products are most commonly biocidal, due to their 97% efficacy. These biocides accumulate in the environment and contain components harmful to humans and marine eco-systems in high quantities. Many biocides are gradually being banned in the EU. Although non-biocidal alternatives exist in the form of foul-release agents, these methods have limited efficacy. We, Acorros, have developed ABIO, the first non-biocidal antifouling coating, combining repellence with release to give 97% efficacy up to 2 years! ABIO is harmless to the marine and human environment and requires 44-56% less coating than existing solutions. ABIO readily adheres to hulls without the need for primers and can be removed using a high-pressure water hose, avoiding abrasion or sanding. ABIO offers effective savings in paint and labour costs of up to €720 per application per 10 m boat, in addition to being gentle on the hull and thus preserving its integrity for longer. ABIO can be used in salt- or fresh-water environments and on all hull types: steel, fibreglass, aluminium, wood, and rubber. Minor repairs/reapplication are uniquely possible underwater. ABIO, our most commercially-ready and innovative solution, is a first-mover in effective non-biocidal antifouling coatings, at a time when growth in the antifouling coatings industry is being slowed down by incoming regulations on biocides. We will enter this market via the recreational boating segment, expecting to sell through dealers and wholesalers to achieve a market share of 2.5% by 2025, by reaching 150,000 boat owners at 2,000 marinas.",1,0
420,73713,No,Integrated treatment of industrial wastes towards prevention of regional water resources contamination,"The Western Balkan Peninsula is rich in natural resources. Among the most important of them are considered the polymetallic complex sulphide ore deposits used for the production of base and precious metals. Exploitation of these ore deposits, one of the m ost dynamic sectors in the Western Balkan region, along with metal extraction that follows cause severe environmental pollution problems in the area, related to contamination of soil and surface-groundwater. This project addresses environmental pollution p roblems associated with solid and liquid wastes/effluents produced by complex sulphide ore mining and metallurgical activities in two Western Balkan countries, in order to develop preventive and remedial technologies aiming at waste minimization, remediati on of waste disposal sites and ultimately prevention of the regional water resources contamination. In order to achieve this objective, the project deals with (a) harmonization of the environmental legislation in Western Balkan countries through implementa tion of the relative EU directives and particularly the IPPC directive, (b) identification and full characterization of the major pollution sources at the selected sites in the two Western Balkan countries and evaluation of the risk for humans and ecosyst em on a source-pathway-target principle and (c) development of an innovative and cost effective integrated management scheme aiming at waste minimization, prevention of surface-groundwater contamination and safeguarding the ecosystem of the affected areas . The strategic objective of this project is the reinforcement of environmental protection,one of the three distinct pillars on which sustainable development for both developed and developing countries is based.It is hoped that this will be one of the firs t steps towards sustainable development of mining and metallurgical industry in Western Balkan countries setting the basis for social cohesion, peace, political stability and prosperity.",0,0

99,82174,Yes,Role of Parathyroid Hormone related Protein (PTHrP) in endochondral bone development: Application as a possible marker for skeletal anomalies in fish,"The high incidence of larvae skeletal deformities is a significant problem in European marine aquaculture. This problem has a serious impact on the industry's productivity, on product quality and on animal welfare. The factors, which may cause skeletal anomalies in fish are largely unstudied, although in tetrapods there is ample evidence that PTHrP plays a significant role in both normal and abnormal development and growth of the skeleton. Preliminary studies carried out by the CME group indicate that PTHrP may be implicated in skeletal deformities, which arise as a consequence of altered chondrogenesis and calcification.  Thus, the fundamental scientific objective of this project is to investigate the importance of the unique hypercalcemic factor identified in fish, PTHrP, in endochondral bone development and its application as a possible marker for skeletal anomalies in fish. This will be achieved through the application of recombinant DNA and gene transfer technology as a tool for the induction of PTHrP gene over expression in fish embryos. The present project programme will therefore aim to establish unequivocally the role of PTHrP in chondrogenesis and skeletal development and link this to skeletal abnormalities. Several objectives have been identified which will contribute to the overall achievement of the aim.  Firstly, obtention of PTHrP expression construct and its microinjection into fertilized fish eggs; Secondly, assessment the ectopic expression of PTHrP in notochord cells of fish embryos and finally, evaluation the influence of PTHrP in the development of axial skeleton. Moreover, additional objectives of this research proposal are to promote the scientific development of the applicant and transfer the technology and knowledge acquired at the host institute during the visit to USA to the CME group at the return host institute. This will be important for the development of these groups' objectives but will also benefit the whole academic community.",0,1

Recognition of TEMPEST laboratory activities by ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording). Summary of the project  The IDEA Project will evaluate the feasibility of electronic identification for farm animals and validate identification systems in real field conditions. One million animals of four species in 6 EU Member States, are being identified applying 3 different types of electronic tags, usually named transponders. Data about application, readings and recovery are being collected in a central database. The project covered initially a period of three years and was launched by the Directorate General for Agriculture (DG AGRI) in 1998. It was extended with another year and should be concluded in early 2002. The Joint Research Centre gives the technical support in terms of performance and conformity testing of electronic identification devices, quality control of equipment, definition and establishment of the central database, data transmission and recording during the project and global evaluation of the results. The analysis and evaluation of the results will allow to determine if electronic identification is a feasible system to trace animals individually from birth to slaughterhouse, and to identify which technology (in terms of electronic tag and reader types) could be suitable for full scale implementation to all livestock in the EU.  Rationale  The identification systems currently used in livestock for fraud control and sanitary purposes (ear tags, tattoos) present the inconvenience of losses, breakage, slow data recording and large number of mistakes due to the manual data transcription. The increase in direct aid to cattle, sheep and goat farmers introduced by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) requires greater efficiency in the management of existing premium schemes.  The implementation of an appropriate animal health surveillance scheme together with the strengthening of measures against animals diseases, and in particular against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), have underlined the need to improve the veterinary monitoring of animals. The Directive 92/102/CEE about the identification and registration of animals, and the recent Council Regulation 820/97 about the registration and identification of bovine and the establishment of a labelling system for bovine meat state in Article 10 and 4, respectively, that the Commission is examining the possibility of introducing electronic identification devices for the identification of the animals.",0,0

113,102296,Yes,SYnergies through Merging BIOlogical and biogeochemical expertise in COral REsearch,"Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and provide livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people around the globe. At the basis of these ecosystems stands the symbiosis between cnidarians and dinoflagellates. How the coral holobiont with its cnidarian host, the dinoflagellate symbiont and the associated microbial community interact with each other and their environment and how this symbiosis reacts to perturbation is the focus of dynamic research worldwide. This project aims at establishing a multidisciplinary initiative to strengthen existing and establishing new collaborative connections between scientists in the field of coral research and to promote the exchange of knowledge and expertise. The proposed partners are at the forefront of coral research in their respective areas, from coral photobiology, photosynthesis regulation, the metabolism of the coral symbiosis and genomics approaches over photoacclimation patterns and coral bleaching to coral ecophysiology and biogeochemical processes. Some of the questions this team wants to address are: What are the effects of climate change on coral reef primary production, respiration and coral photo-physiology? How do photoacclimation patterns of corals influence bleaching potential? Is there more to coral bleaching than the physiological breakdown of the symbiosis? What are the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of phase shifts in coral reefs? Through the collaborative efforts within the SymbioCoRe project namely, workshops, seminars and staff exchanges to promote knowledge transfer, we will be able to contribute to a holistic understanding of these complex processes. This action will increase the skills and knowledge of all partners involved and will improve the position of the European Research Area in the global effort to develop better models of the host/symbiont relationship and to build effective approaches to better protect coral reefs and the associated ecosystems.",1,1
962,104903,No,Development of GlycoPhage Arrays as a novel high-throughput method for glycomics,"Complex carbohydrates (glycans) are attached to proteins and lipids by the process of glycosylation and play important roles in many biological processes including cell-cell recognition, metabolic trafficking and host-pathogen interactions. Altered glycosylation or variations in the synthesis of glycans are known to cause diseases including cancer, retroviral infection and disorders of the heart, lung and blood. In order to establish connections between glycan structures and their functions (functional glycomics), to monitor glycosylation in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis, the development of precise, robust and sensitive methodologies for glycan analysis is critical. Carbohydrate-based arrays, or “glycoarrays,” have emerged in the last decade as a powerful tool, however to fully exploit the potential of arrays, it will be necessary to (i) increase the quantity and diversity of carbohydrate structures and (ii) develop reliable and reproducible chemistries for the immobilization of the carbohydrate probes onto solid support. Recently, the protein glycosylation locus (Pgl) discovered in Campylobacter jejuni was functionally transferred to E. coli, conferring ability to glycosylate proteins. Additionally, Dr. Celik has recently demonstrated glycosylation of phage particles simply by infecting the glycosylation competent E. coli with M13 phage displaying an acceptor protein. The hypothesis of this particular application is that the presentation of N-glycosylated proteins and O-antigens on phage particles can be exploited for the development of glycan arrays. The study will be significant because it will overcome the current bottlenecks in glycan array construction and provide a relatively inexpensive, specific and stable glycan representation method, as well as introduce a simplified and universal purification technique that is not dependent on the carbohydrate.",0,0
768,107578,No,Escapees in European Aquaculture Development of an Escape proof Net Especially for Cod Bass and Bream Fish Farming,Intensive farming of species like Seabass Seabream and Cod uses to a large extent technology that traditionally was developed and specialized for salmon farming purposes. This has been shown not to be optimal among other things with respect to net design materials used and resistance against gnaws and chip ups. The reason for these problems is species differences regarding behaviour Seabass seabream and cod are much more curious and aggressive towards the net than other species and in biting sucking and snatching on loose rope ends knots etc. is often seen.  As a result holes in the net may occur leading to escapees and loss of fish stock. Due to this there is considerable concern with respect to aquaculture representing a threat to ecology and biodiversity representing risk of disease transfer from aquaculture to wild fish populations and potential Sgenetic pollution of wild fish. In addition loss of farmed stock represent a considerable decrease in competitiveness for a large community of European aquaculture SMEs.  Our idea is to develop a cost effective sea cage net suitable for farming of typical net aggressive fish species initially important for the European fish farming industry and in the near future i.e. European seabass Gilthead seabream and Atlantic cod by identifying a costeffective polyolefin material with the right characteristics to prevent disruption and chip ups due to the mishandling from the farmed fish. To achieve these objectives we will need to develop a net filament with improved physical characteristics and incorporated impregnation and repulsive agents that prevent fouling and biting and snatching behaviour. An adaptation of existing net manufacturing technique for optimal exploitation of material characteristics will be developed and used to produce a net with a developed new net design that improves adaptation regarding species specificity net configuration strength and durability and low labour costs...,1,0
257,94227,Yes,Climate Change and Marine Ecosystem Research Results,"Although there is no certainty regarding the precise nature and rate of future climate change, even the most moderate scenarios predict a continuing change of the marine environment, with associated major environmental and social impacts. To prepare society for the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures, the awareness of citizens to research results, both certainties and uncertainties, in this specific area should be raised. During the last years, much new information has been gathered in large EU-funded research, but to date this information has not been synthesized nor has it become an important part of public knowledge. The aim of this proposal is to make a synthesis of EU research results on the impacts of climate change on the marine environment and to make this knowledge and its socio-economic consequences better known to European citizens and society at large. Together with expert representatives of major Networks of Excellence, large EU projects and research networks, we will produce a state-of-the-art overview of European research results on the effects of climate change on marine environment. An up-to-date overview of public knowledge and perception on the effects of climate change on marine environments and their socio-economic consequences will be produced by means of polls and questionnaires. The results will be used to identify the main issues to be addressed and the best practices to be used during the outreach activities. Enhancement of public knowledge on climate change impacts on the marine environment, including the socio-economic consequences, will be achieved by means of challenging and innovative tools such as an interactive Pan-European conference at the end of 2010 and a high-quality internet-based portal within an e-learning platform.

The network of HYDRALAB is unique in the hydraulic research community and has large experience in co-operating since its start in 1997. It began by informing and co-ordinating the activities of the partners in HYDRALAB I and II, and via strong collaboration in HYDRALAB III we will now realize further integration of our research services in Europe in HYDRALAB IV. Over the course of 10 years our network has grown from 8 participants in 1997 to a total of 30 participants from 15 countries today. Research in our infrastructures deals with complex questions regarding the interaction of water with environmental elements, sediment, structures and ice and goes beyond just hydraulic research: hence we have adopted the theme More than water. Questions that we need to answer deal with e.g. the development of adaptive strategies to climate change and sustainable measures against natural hazards, like floods. A fully integrated and balanced ensemble of Networking Activities (5), Joint Research Activities (4) and Transnational Access Activities (10) enhances the operation of our infrastructures and their instrumentation facilities beyond the present state-of-the-art and identifies potential future developments. By means of the common User Selection Procedure optimal access is guaranteed. With our dissemination events we foster a culture of co-operation between the participants and the wider user community. Further objectives of HYDRALAB IV are to improve access to experimental data, by providing researchers with a database on results of experiments, and bring young researchers and first time users from across Europe to the cutting edge of experimental research.

1034,83233,No,Imaging the transfer function of a cortical input layer,"The functional properties of local neuronal microcircuits determine the computational capacity of specialized brain structures and drive animal behaviour. The cerebellum is a specialized anatomical structure that is involved in the learning and execution of motor coordination.  It contains only a handful of morphological cell types that have been extensively characterized. Theoretical calculations and computer modeling studies have suggested several ways in which the connectivity and physiological activity might be translated into motor control.  However, experimental validation of the input-output function of the cerebellar microcircuit is still lacking. We propose an original experimental paradigm to unravel how the cerebellar cortical circuit processes incoming sensory-motor inputs in its input layer. First, we will mimic physiological cortical inputs in a reduced preparation of the vestibulo-cerebellum. Secondly, we will monitor simultaneously the activity of multiple identified neurons within the circuit in situ.  To this end we will use an innovative multi-photon microscope that has been developed in the sponsor's laboratory in Paris. This unique device, based on acousto-optic deflectors-operated beam steering, performs 250 kHz digital scanning as well as digital photon counting.  It is a promising tool to perform long-duration optical multiunit recordings (50 cells) with millisecond temporal resolution in situ. Additionally, the improved spatial and temporal resolution afforded by acousto-optical beam steering allows distributed excitation of hundreds of points in a plane.  Combining this technology with glutamate uncaging will allow us to study integration of synaptic inputs by stimulating controlled physiological patterns of neuronal excitation that mimic cortical inputs. Together, these innovative techniques bear great promise to improve our understanding of the computational dynamics in brain structures.",0,0

1150,92717,No,Under the light of electrons,"Here, we propose to explore and characterize new emerging phenomena in low dimensional (LD) and artificially structured oxide based systems by means of advanced electron microscopy techniques. Complex oxides have a large range of applications, since their properties change drastically as their precise composition and structure changes. When obtained in LD configurations new functionalities arise which are of fundamental interest in electronics, spintronics, energy or nanophotonics. We will use atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy in the aberration corrected electron microscope to map their electronic, optical and magnetic properties by means of electron chiral dichroism. We intend to combine spectroscopic magnetic imaging with plasmonic measurements in order to explore, for the first time ever, the sensitivity of electron spectroscopy to magneto-optical properties at high spatial resolution. Our scientific mission will be to a) synthetize and characterize high quality oxide based LD systems and develop new imaging techniques, in order to b) explore new phenomena in systems showing unexpected behaviors. Our approach relies on comprehensive studies with atomic resolution, in real space, and when possible, at work (under the relevant temperature or pressure conditions). We will combine experiments with theory in order to interpret results and design new avenues to follow. This proposal has also a dual strategic component: 1) to create a new group in Spain devoted to study materials physics in such a way, and 2) to establish a world-class collaboration connecting the group to established growers and theorists, assembling a multidisciplinary team.

1069,82267,Yes,Organic warmwater fish production through activated suspension and periphyton-based ecological technology,"The proposed research will develop an in-depth understanding of the use of natural food production to support intensive warm water culture of fish. Current aquaculture in Europe is based on carnivorous fish species, usually produced in marine cages or flow-through ponds, reliant on diets rich in marine fishmeal and oils. This causes negative impacts on surrounding ecosystems and makes the products sensitive to contamination by persistent chemicals. Tilapias, as herbivorous fish that grow well on bacterial-detrital aggregate and periphyton in their natural tropical environment, can potentially be raised in well-insulated systems in Europe based on locally produced plant-based feedstocks. Commercial systems could become part of a diversification option for organic farmers, allowing them to add value to locally grown crops and develop local niche markets for high quality, fully traceable food.  The research will optimise a production system based on the principles of activated suspension (AS) and periphyton enhancement (PE) in which relatively low protein feeds can be used to raise tilapia in highly aerated tanks to maintain both feed and water quality levels. The quality and quality of water used, natural and supplemental foods and effluents will be monitored in both AS, AS\PE and conventional recycled systems (RS). System nitrogen and energy efficiencies will be assessed for both systems and budgets derived. Environmental impacts are expected to be positive and the research outcomes to have important social and economic implications for rural areas of Europe.  The research builds on the competency of the International Fellow and the host institution in the area of sustainable fish production. It is based around bringing together novel techniques that have been tested and are in use in the tropics, into a European context. The research experience should ensure valuable training in new techniques and exposure of the Fellow to more intensive approaches to fish production.",1,1
801,16875,No,The development of commercial products from the great silver smelt (Argentilus silus),"The aims are to study the properties of the flesh from the great silver smelt (Argentinus Silus), with the objective of the development of commercially acceptable consumer products from the species, including fillets, fillet strips, mince, fish fingers, fish portions, fishballs and other similar products. The economic and marketing aspects of the various products is to be assessed.  A study has been made of the properties of the flesh from the Great Silver Smelt (Argentinus Silus), in order to develop commercially acceptable consumer products from the species.   Careful machine filleting and bone separation is essential in order to obtain a commercial yield and to remove small bones and skin. The Silver Smelt is low in fat and has a white flesh and a bland flavour which makes it suitable for consumer fish products. It has good water binding and gel forming properties, with fresh and frozen fillets best in this regard and frozen mince the worst. Freezing and long term frozen storage results in a decline in flesh whiteness and an increasing toughness in frozen mince which is carried out through into products. Due to this it is desirable to make products from fresh or frozen whole fish or fillets rather than from frozen mince. Highly acceptable fishcakes and enrobed prawn analogues were made from the Silver Smelt but enrobed nuggets and fingers made from block frozen mince were tough.   The potential for product development is very substantial, provided commercial interests can be convinced of continuity of supply. The research work is divided into 6 parts :  effect of catching and handling methods on flesh quality;  processing of the fish;  evaluation of mince and fillets;  product development;  economic aspects;  and technology transfer.",0,0
775,91114,No,The formation of Europe prehistoric population dynamics and the roots of socio cultural diversity,Our major goal is to test with quantitative and qualitative tools the hypothesis that some key aspects of the current economic and socio cultural diversity of European nations have roots in prehistory. We shall integrate the expertise in mathematics computing archaeology palaeodemography and palaeoenvironment into an interdisciplinary approach aimed at a groundbreaking comprehensive theory of the Neolithic Revolution. We shall quantify and hence clarify the interaction of the environmental factors with social cultural and human aspects of the Neolithic Revolution.  This project will be the first to consider the Neolithisation of Western Central and Eastern Europe as a pan European process. Our main tool will be a novel mathematical model of population dynamics for the epoch of the initial spread of the Neolithic in Europe 8000 - 3000 BC.  The model will be based on advanced population dynamics theory with full allowance for environmental factors including geomorphology waterways and coastlines soil fertility and biomass and climatic variations.  The methodology of parameter estimation for large scale population dynamics models will be developed and various mathematical and geostatistical approaches to local and non local demographic processes will be implemented.  The model will be refined using the abundant radiocarbon age determinations genetic markers and archaeological evidence. Much of the high resolution archaeological evidence will be collected in several case studies focussed on the Adriatic Sea area the Eastern Balkans Central and Eastern Europe.  Our results may significantly change the understanding of the origin and nature of modern cultural social and economic diversity in Europe.

AquaMMS will be suitable for use primarily in land-based aquaculture industry, but other markets are also relevant including environmental monitoring sector and the water supply industry. This technology will provide the fish farmer with advance warning of a broad range of potential pollutants, like toxic metals, phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, hydrogen sulphide and geosmins. These pollutants can otherwise inflict chronic stress on the farmed fish resulting in disease outbreaks and/or poor product quality, which means lost profit to the fish farms. Most of these parameters are at present technically challenging to measure accurately on a regular basis and may only be analysed when problems arise on the farm and samples are sent for more comprehensive analysis at external laboratories. Q-technologies (UK) has successfully developed miniature mass spectrometry (MMS) technology for the oil and gas industry, and has seen the need and potential in developing and marketing a similar system for the aquaculture industry. Therefore, they have taken the initiative to propose the AquaMMS project by combining forces with the  SMES, Faaltech (Ireland) and BAMO (Germany). Together, these SMEs will form the production and distribution chain of the product post project. Anglesey Aquaculture Ltd (UK) and Telemarks Roye as (Norway) will take part in the project representing the end user community and will act as a test sites for the developed technology. Anglsey Aquaculture and Telemarks Roye will benefit from improved production by using AquaMMS ahead of its competitors.

In this context, innovation in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) field along with new forms of service delivery organization such as home care services represents a viable solution for a better management of the ageing process. Holistic and smart approaches including a health network system to early diagnose movement disability and give early appropriate feedback in terms of rehabilitation strategies minimizing and retarding the ageing effects are more effective than others for individuals, families, and care givers. Thus the proposed innovating STEADY service composed of an interoperable ICT infrastructure addresses current limitations of fall management systems and services to meet the need for delivery of support to older people who might be or are at risk of falling. STEADY will therefore integrate an infrastructure for the implementation of a comprehensive fall management service by means of innovative usage of available technologies (tele-monitoring, e-care management, rehabilitation assistance by predictive control and image-based visual servoing) and targeted both on preventative and reactive aspects promoting safety and independent living support. The determinants of healthy ageing, the component of fall risks and the best strategies of rehabilitation will be the basis of the project implementation.",0,0
266,29523,Yes,FEEDING ECOLOGY OF NORTH SEA FISH WITH EMPHASIS ON THE DATA BASE OF THE 'STOMACH SAMPLING PROJECT 1991' FOR USE IN MULTISPECIES ASSESSMENT,"The project mainly aims at an analysis of existing databases on stomach contents. The stomachs have been analysed already and the results are available on computer systems. Stomach data will analysed for five predator species: cod, whiting, haddock, saithe and mackerel with regard to the following goals:  A. analysis of change over time: the 1991 data will for all species be compared with an equivalent data set from 1981. For cod and whiting the comparison will include data from 1985-1987, for cod also from 1980, 1982 and 1984;  B. analysis of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of feeding : among other tasks an analysis of the effects of variability of the total stomach contents and the shares of fish prey classes in the predator stomach will be undertaken together with the assessment of prey size preferences,prey switching, the effects of competition between predators and local suitabilities;  C. inter ecosystem comparison:    The comparative analysis between different ecosystems will have its starting point from the results of the analysis of the North Sea data. The main ecosystem for comparison will be the Baltic, because large subsets of these data are accessible at two of the participating institutes. The comparison with the Baltic system is restricted to cod being the only important predator in the Baltic system. Cooperation is also planned with scientists from the USA and Norway. In the case of the USA, the data refers to cod and haddock stomachs from the Georges Bank area, while Norwegian data is available from cod of the Barents Sea.",1,1
171,96760,Yes,Coral Reefscape Ecology and Mapping,"Tropical coral reefs shelter a high rate of marine biodiversity and provide a sizeable amount of ecological services. These ecosystems of interest face tremendous and pervasive challenges from human demography skyrockets and inherent development pressures, as well as climate change and associated sea level rise. Prospects of coral reefs conservation, critically inevitable, will achieve through the growth of understanding their ecological mechanisms. The spatial distribution of coral reef plays a key role in ecological processes, including biodiversity structure, variability, connectivity and resilience. The current expansion and pluridisciplinarity of remote sensing technology fosters us to use it as the optimal tool (time- and cost-effective) to reliably and frequently monitoring reefscape features (geomorphic, oceanographic and ecological) across local and regional scales. The goals of this project are to: -couple multiscale and multiplatform remotely-sensed products, such as high-resolution spaceborne and airborne passive images and airborne bathymetric LiDAR active imagery, in order to define an on-line systematic classification scheme of tropical coral reef ecosystems based upon both structural and functional benthic mapping draped over 3D habitat; -develop concepts and methods of the coral reefscape ecology, in order to (i) describe and quantify relationships between the structural complexity of these habitats and ecological characteristics of associated bentho-pelagic communities, such as the diversity, the mobility and the dispersion, and (ii) establish and temporally monitor a coral reef health index related to spectral and spatial proxies; -predict the habitat suitability of species of interest (endangered or indicator taxa), of communities of interest, and to classify reefscape features by protection rank (facilitating the marine spatial planning), in modelling relationships between biotic and environmental variables, through remotely-sensed proxies.",1,1
668,104817,No,The manufacturing of a biological tissue: REgeneration of the JOINt by Developmental engineering,"'The general aim of REJOIND is to provide proof-of-principle for the in vitro manufacturing of a growing bone, with a bioartificial growth plate as a “driving engine” at its core. To achieve this, we propose a developmental engineering approach, based on the modular design of in vitro processes consisting of sequential units corresponding to in vivo developmental stages.  These processes follow a gradual and coordinated progression of tissue growth and cell differentiation that leads to organization of cells into intermediate tissue forms. At every step of the developmental engineering process, computational models will be applied, in order to form a  quantitative foundation for every process and to optimize these. After establishment of a manufacturing process of a growth plate, REJOIND will combine this tissue with osteoblasts or articular chondrocytes to build osteochondral tissues or bioartificial joints. Ultimately, REJOIND aims to achieve an autonomous process of in vitro tissue growth allowing guided size expansion. A close interaction between biologists and engineers will make this possible. Pre-clinical applications that will be explored in animal models range from the repair of deep osteochondral defects in a joint surface, to a total joint replacement for small arthritic joints. We expect that a number of these implants will provide a cartilaginous template for bone formation, therefore some will be tested in vivo in appropriate models for healing of long bone defects. In conclusion, REJOIND aims to provide evidence that through the use of developmental engineering, we can build a tissue in vitro, moving the boundary from manufacturing and control at the cellular level to tissue organization and function. This methodology will result in a more reliable in vivo outcome of tissue engineered products, and thus a more predictable and sustainable clinical outcome in the patient.'",0,0
662,88127,No,Swimming for reproduction (REPRO-SWIM): Identification of swimming induced metabolic and hormonal switches that trigger reproduction,"A long standing question in the reproductive physiology of fish is how the metabolic status determines the onset of sexual reproduction, which often coincides with the start of reproductive migration. We hypothesize that swimming in that case triggers metabolic and hormonal changes critical for the induction of maturation. Studies on migrant fish like eel and salmon support the hypothesis that swimming triggers sexual reproduction, mobilises energy reserves for fuel and positively influences gamete quality. The mechanism behind this is however non-elucidated. Exercise, such as performed by migratory species, can be used as an experimental factor in studying the interaction between the metabolic processes and the onset of sexual maturation. This knowledge is important in optimising aquaculture of commercially interesting species, taking rainbow trout as a model. This study will identify the key metabolic and hormonal factors and their expression profiles in the onset of sexual reproduction as induced by swimming. Using microarray technology, the transcriptional response to exercise of all important tissues involved - gonad, muscle, liver, fat, brain and pituitary - will be analysed in a holistic approach. The main genes involved in both reproductive and metabolic functions will be identified. The role of insulin-like growth factors, the most important candidates, will be established. The expression profile of the main identified genes will be confirmed by real time PCR. The function of the main regulated genes will be investigated in vivo by implanting zebrafish cells that express each of the selected genes. The career objective of the applicant is to acquire additional skills and expertise in becoming a multidisciplinary fish reproduction expert. In addition he would have insight in the role of swimming as natural reproductive trigger. The host and collaborators have an excellent scientific status and are capable to support this project.",0,0
57,97075,Yes,Aquatic Technology Linked to A Novel Treatment of Invasive Species,"The development of a Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) system, that will efficiently target and incapacitate a full spectrum of marine organisms <50µm. The introduction of invasive marine species into new environments from discharge of ships’ ballast water has been identified as the 4th largest threat to the world’s oceans. The UN’s International Maritime Organisation has adopted a convention for a mandatory BWT system on both new and existing ships by 2016. Unlike other forms of marine pollution, such as oil spills, where ameliorative action can be taken and from which the environment will eventually recover, the impacts of invasive marine species are often irreversible. In addition, with 80% of the world’s commodities transported by sea, there is an environmental and commercial need to develop an effective solution to the dispersal of untreated ballast water. In the proposed Atlantis project, we intend to research and develop a BWT system using multi-biocidal delivery technology. This will efficiently target and incapacitate a full spectrum of marine organisms <50µm. We propose to develop a high surface-area substrate with multi-functional surface properties, enabling multiple biocides to be incorporated. This substrate will be designed into a filter bed that the entire volume of ballast water must pass through. Therefore, treatment of the ballast water happens as it moves through the high concentration of biocides held within the filter bed. As the biocides are held within the substrate, they can work effectively together, incapacitating the full spectrum of flora and fauna, whilst significantly reducing the amount of biocides released in the ballast system. This project will be conducted by an EC based SME consortium supported by two RTD’s, who will work towards developing a market leading system that could generate sales in excess of €80 million in 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the SME consortium.",1,1
50,97547,Yes,Changes in carbon uptake and emissions by oceans in a changing climate,"CARBOCHANGE will provide the best possible process-based quantification of net ocean carbon uptake under changing climate conditions using past and present ocean carbon cycle changes for a better prediction of future ocean carbon uptake. We will improve the quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical and physical processes through a combination of observations and models. We will upscale new process understanding to large-scale integrative feedbacks of the ocean carbon cycle to climate change and rising carbon dioxide concentrations. We will quantify the vulnerability of the ocean carbon sources and sinks in a probabilistic sense using cutting edge coupled Earth system models under a spectrum of emission scenarios including climate stabilisation scenarios as required for the 5th IPCC assessment report. The drivers for the vulnerabilities will be identified. The most actual observations of the changing ocean carbon sink will be systematically integrated with the newest ocean carbon models, a coupled land-ocean model, an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, and fully fledged Earth system models through a spectrum of data assimilation methods as well as advanced performance assessment tools. Results will be optimal process descriptions and most realistic error margins for future ocean carbon uptake quantifications with models under the presently available observational evidence. The project will deliver calibrated future evolutions of ocean pH and carbonate saturation as required by the research community on ocean acidification in the EU project EPOCA and further projects in this field. The time history of atmosphere-ocean carbon fluxes past, present, and future will be synthesised globally as well as regionally for the transcontinental RECCAP project. Observations and model results will merge into GEOSS/GEO through links with the European coordination action COCOS and will prepare the marine branch of the European Research Infrastructure ICOS.",1,1
957,31581,No,Trial application of the European computerized reservation and information systems ECRIS in Austria and Germany,"ECRIS is a computerised reservation and information system. This system is designed to enable tourist customers to gain information about regions, destinations, service providers from a tourist board or travel agency and/or to book a tourist service and make all the necessary payment transactions associated with it. The project is founded on product design and development using new object-oriented and distributed software technologies.  ECRIS is a client/server system, where the server and the clients can be found in the local or regional tourist boards or in the associated information centres. Every one of these clients enables a customer to book, pay and receive a voucher for any room stored in the server's database. ECRIS is the first project that uses ORBIS to handle interprocess communication between client and server according to CORBA 2.0 standard. Each of the hotels participating in the ECRIS system has a database, which provides current data on the hotel against payment. Since this new technology for interprocess communication has not been used in productive applications, ECRIS will be tested with two pilot customers, TIBS Stuttgart and the Sölden tourist board.  Two companies will participate in the ECRIS project: Siemens will provide the migration and implementation and START the know-how, particularly with respect to reservation and information. The trial application is divided into the following five work packages:  1. Migration of the systems; 2. Execution of trial - Installation; 3. System test at user; 4. Analysis for optimisation of functionality; 5. Adaptation and additional development.  This approach is to demonstrate the suitability of the technology and development environment used for the defined product requirements, to gain data and experience about a new product concept, and its acceptance by the customers of the tourism market (both providers and consumers).",0,0
954,198382,No,Open dynamic Manufacturing Operating System for Smart Plug-and-Produce Automation Components,"Higher agility for the European Manufacturing Industry is the main MOTIVATION for the openMOS project. While automated systems are appealing to achieve high productivity and quality requirements, their sensitivity to change is becoming increasingly a bottleneck to substantial reduction of lot sizes and more frequent change-overs.  The project VISION is to enable full economic sustainability of the production systems based on intelligent modular plug-and-produce equipment. To achieve this, it is focusing on three main innovation strands: 1) embedding plug-and-produce capabilities into automation devices, robots and machines, 2) enabling vertical and horizontal connectivity between plug-and-produce automation components and higher level control and business functions, and 3) creating a easily extendable and adaptable manufacturing operating system (MOS) that permits the easy introduction of new products, work orders and changes in the equipment and allows easy deployment of optimisation and changeover management strategies. The targeted INNOVATION is a common, openly accessible plug-and-produce system platform which allows all stakeholders in the automation system value chain to come together and jointly develop and exploit solutions. Therefore, the project is proposing to integrate well established plug-and-produce system concepts from many years of research in this field, into industrial-relevant technology platforms which have emerged in recent years.  As the vast majority of components/ devices/ machine manufacturers and system integrators are SMEs, plug-and-produce can only be achieved by placing specific SME requirements at the forefront: solutions by, and for, SMEs. The RTD approach will be driven by proposed industrial scenarios and pilot implementations which will be carried out to systematically test and validate the readiness of the targeted exploitable results in three key industrial sectors (white goods, automotive and electronics).",0,0

350,208730,No,Single-Molecule Studies on Condensin,"For division of each of our cells, 2 meters of DNA should be replicated, compacted into a few-micrometer size chromosomes that are segregated and distributed via mitosis, so that each daughter cell gets exactly one copy. How this large DNA genome is well organized into such a small volume is one of the hottest issues for the understanding of chromosomes. Condensin, a ring-like structure formed by SMC dimers, kleisin, and two heat domains, embraces DNA and condenses the DNA using ATP hydrolysis. However, the molecular mechanism on how conformational changes of condensin compact DNA is still unknown. Here, the applicant Dr. Je-Kyung Ryu proposes to use two orthogonal single-molecule approaches, “high-speed AFM (HS AFM)” and “single-molecule fluorescent magnetic tweezers” to reveal the molecular mechanism of condensin. HS AFM imaging is a unique technique to record video-rate real-time images for entire structure of a protein in physiological condition with high spatiotemporal resolution (~1nm, ~50ms). In addition, using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy combined with magnetic tweezers, the applicant can understand how the cooperative binding of condensin to DNA correlate with DNA condensation. These two approaches will not only provide most important clues to understand the mechanism of condensin how DNA enters and exits the condensin ring and how condensin shapes chromosome but also include technical advances in single-molecule techniques. This work will be carried out in the laboratory of Prof. Cees Dekker, who is a world leader in HS AFM and single-molecule biophysics of DNA-protein interactions. The applicant’s experts in single-molecule biophysics, fluorescence microscopy, and biochemistry will make synergetic effects with the resources of the Dekker lab to collectively meet the interdisciplinary demands of the innovative effort.",0,0
16,226769,Yes,Stochastic Transport in Upper Ocean Dynamics,"71% of Earth is covered by ocean. The ocean has absorbed 93% of the heat trapped by human’s greenhouse gas emissions. The ocean’s future responses to continued warming are uncertain. Our project will deliver new capabilities for assessing variability and uncertainty in upper ocean dynamics. It will provide decision makers a means of quantifying the effects of local patterns of sea level rise, heat uptake, carbon storage and change of oxygen content and pH in the ocean. Its multimodal monitoring will enhance the scientific understanding of marine debris transport, tracking of oil spills and accumulation of plastic in the sea.  Our approach accounts for transport on scales that are currently unresolvable in computer simulations, yet are observable by satellites, drifters and floats. Four scientific capabilities will be engaged: (i) observations at high resolution of upper ocean properties such as temperature, salinity, topography, wind, waves and velocity; (ii) large scale numerical simulations; (iii) data-based stochastic equations for upper ocean dynamics that quantify simulation error; and (iv) stochastic data assimilation to reduce uncertainty. These four scientific capabilities will tackle a network of joint tasks achieved through cooperation of three world-calibre institutions: IFREMER (ocean observations, reanalysis); INRIA (computational science); and Imperial College (mathematics, data assimilation). Our complementary skill sets comprise a single systemic effort: (1) Coordinate and interpret high-resolution satellite and in situ upper ocean observations (2) Extract correlations from data needed for the mathematical model (3) Perform an ensemble of computer simulations using our new stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) which are derived by matching the observed statistical properties (4) Apply advanced data assimilation and computer simulations to reduce model uncertainty The key to achieving these goals will be synergy in our combined expertise.",0,1
259,48060,Yes,Performance and Ecological Impacts of Introduced and Escaped Fish: Physiological and Behavioural Mechanisms.,"The culture of fish is an important European industry. However, there is now a growing awareness that releases of cultured fish for stocking may be ineffective and may also have detrimental impacts on wild populations. In the target species for this proposal, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta), such effects are well documented, but the physiological and endocrinological mechanisms underlying the domestication process is poorly now. As a consequence, it is not possible to predict with confidence the ecological impact of domestication.   The objectives of this project are:   - To identify how domestication affects the interrelation between physiology and behaviour and how this relates to performance (i.e. growth, survival and reproduction) under natural and semi-natural conditions - To assess genetic and environmental impacts of cultured fish on wild conspecifics at various life stages through competition and interbreeding  These objectives will met by three complementary approaches:  Physiology and behaviour - Basic performance (Task 1):   The first group of experiments concentrates on comparative physiology and behaviour, with special emphasis on: (i) genetic effects of hatchery selection; (ii) environmental effects of the hatchery; (iii) effects of increased energetic needs. These experiments will reveal how domestication alters some important physiological and behavioural mechanisms.  Source of variation: Effects of phenotypic expression of growth related characters (Task 2):   The second group of experiments includes measurements of heritability and genetic correlations for a number of physiological and behavioural traits that are known to be important for fitness. The measures are crucial for evaluating the potential effects of domestication and their incidence in natural populations.  Ecological impacts on wild populations (Task 3):  The third group of experiments is linked to the previous two tasks as it focuses on the ecological impact of domesticated traits of hatchery fish on wild co specifics in nature.",0,1
356,88345,No,Marine Micro-Algae as Global Reservoir of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Degraders,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognised as priority pollutants to the environment and human health because of their poor water solubility, recalcitrance, inherent toxicity and potential to bio-accumulate in higher organisms – EU Water Framework Directive (No. 2000/60/EC). To manage and mitigate the impacts of PAH pollution in the marine environment, it is necessary that we understand the mechanisms involved in their biodegradation. For this, the applicant has identified a previously unrecognised niche – i.e. the surfaces of marine phytoplankton – to which both specialist and generalist PAH-degrading bacteria (PAH-DB) are associated. This new finding is significant for three main reasons: (1) It defines for the first time a physical zone in our oceans that harbours PAH bio-catalytic activity; (2) It suggests that, based on the ubiquity of phytoplankton in our oceans, this pool of biocatalytic activity is widespread and likely to be concentrated within the euphotic zone; and (3) The association of this bacterial catabolic activity with phytoplankton could help government task forces improve on methods to mitigate marine oil and PAH pollution. The aims of this Outgoing International Fellowship are to utilise the expertise offered by the US host (University of North Carolina) in their exclusive use of a unique set of uniformly 13C-labeled PAH compounds coupled with molecular techniques (DNA-SIP, qPCR, DGGE) to identify and quantitatively assess PAH-DB that are specifically associated with phytoplankton species representing the major taxonomic groups. Together with the applicant’s extensive experience, and the skills and techniques (C14 PAH degradation, respirometry etc) offered by the return host (University of Lancaster), these objectives will be accomplished through the initiation of a trans-Atlantic collaboration between the European Union and the USA in a study that for the first time aims to define a link between PAH-DB and marine phytoplankton.",1,0

In this frame an overall assessment, critical thinking and reasoning are necessary to draft the lines of future developments. This will respond to the need of understanding the place of algae and aquatic biomass in the present and future renewable energy sources portfolio in EU, with a careful eye to sustainability and social implications. Such action can be effective only involving major stakeholders, defining the present situation in a realistic perspective and this way providing a valuable contribution to shape future developments. AquaFUELS aims to draw the detailed, comprehensive and concrete picture of the actual status quo of EU and international initiatives on algae biofuels. Based on this work, AquaFUELS will successively elaborate an overall assessment on the technology, and identify major research and industrial needs. The surveys and assessments produced by AquaFUELS will address the full life cycle analysis - from collection to fuel use - in terms of environmental, economic and social sustainability. A major mean to reach project goals will be the coordination of a critical mass of ongoing research activities, that will be actively involved in the preparation of surveys as well as in the elaboration of the assessment studies and identification of future needs.

234,217880,Yes,SAIL&CLEAN – A complete solution for sea cleaning: marine litter removal and optimal algal bloom harvesting,"Europe is currently facing a huge and complex challenge when it comes to cleaning its oceans. On one hand, marine litter represents a tremendous environmental problem. Plastics pose a serious threat to all marine animals, as well as to boats and coasts. There are more than 150 million tonnes of plastics accumulated in the world's oceans while up to 8 million tons are added every year. On the other, eutrophication is causing an intensification of harmful algal bloom episodes, which lead to fish die-offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries. In the EU the annual cost of those blooms surpasses the €900 million. Municipalities and public authorities in charge of the preservation of the coasts still fail at targeting these issues at the same time because current solutions consist of either simple barges that collect debris in shallow waters or boats that can harvest the undesirable algae but unable to remove litter. Asco Harvester is an Icelandic SME committed to the development of a new family of efficient and sustainable boats that can tackle these two problems thanks to their dual functionality. Our boats can mow toxic algae and clean garbage and other waste from seas and ocean waters simultaneously. ASCO boats exhibit a very high harvesting productivity (40% higher than current harvesters) and are capable of working in difficult areas, such as fjords, open oceans or river canal. In addition, they incorporate a very efficient module able to capture up to 15 tons/day of plastic and other marine litter. We have implemented a business model based in selling and renting our boats to respond to seasonal demands thus maximising our business opportunity. By the end of 2024 (five years after market launch), we expect to have 70 units in the market: 38 units sold and 32 rented, with an associated cumulative profit of €11.2 M.",1,1
824,205939,No,Incubate a New Learning and Inspiration Framework for Education,"INLIFE will provide an innovative gamification framework targeting both typical as well as special education and social inclusion activities based on Serious Games. INLIFE’s core concept leverages on the potential of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm to directly link actions, decisions and events happening in real-life with in-game educational progress and modern gaming technologies. This bridge strengthens the infusion of gamification into non-leisure contexts, boosting at the same time the creation of new educational methodologies as well as new business opportunities. The challenge INLIFE addresses is to effectively join the forces of gaming industries, IoT technologies and social science research outcomes to support the development of creative and effective applications in education and for social inclusion.  The INLIFE framework will be based on an open, layered architecture, consisting of modules supporting agile abstraction methods, model-driven development and transformation technologies, as well as state-of-the-art gaming and human-computer interaction techniques. It will enable the bidirectional, real time communication between the serious game and the surrounding environment, bringing the player in the center of the game while living the reality.  The INLIFE technologies, tools and software solutions will be validated in four carefully set pilots through the integration and demonstration of two selected serious games, one for the education of children and students on environmental sustainability and one targeted at assisting children with autism to learn, thus facilitating their social inclusion.

841,51250,No,Biodiversity in herbaceous semi-natural ecosystems under stress by global change components,"Problems to be solved Biodiversity is threatened by various human activities. Land-use change appears to be a major threat worldwide. In Europe, direct impacts of present alterations in land-use practices are still of significant importance, in particular for semi-natural ecosystems which rely on particular management practices. However, other drivers of biodiversity have also to be taken into account. The BIOSTRESS consortium is convinced that tropospheric ozone represents a global change component of major importance as a driver of biodiversity. Ozone concentrations in the boundary layer of our planet have been increasing dramatically over the past one hundred years and have now reached phytotoxic levels perturbing plant growth. The BIOSTRESS project aims, in support of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the European Community Biodiversity Strategy, to understand and detect changes in biodiversity as affected by ozone, and to provide end-users of ecological information with a user-friendly, general expert system tool for vegetation science. Scientific objectives and approach In order to gain a general understanding of the processes driving biodiversity, computer models are used to carry out experiments on virtual plant communities. Two types of model are employed for these virtual experiments: (1) mechanistic plant community growth based on physiological plant traits, and (2) cellular automata plant community growth based on plant functional types (C-S-R classification of vegetation). The mechanistic model serves primarily to simulate short-term effects (some seasons) whereas the cellular automata model simulates long-term effects. Both types of model are in interaction with, and calibrated against, each other, and compared with results recorded by the consortium in real world experiments. Real world experiments are carried out on a broad spectrum of European herbaceous semi-natural ecosystems established either as mesososms of model plant communities or as complex and realistic systems. These real world systems are exposed to tropospheric ozone as a global change component, and the effects of this pollutant both on plant species diversity and on structural diversity of soil microbial communities are assessed. Expected impacts The project will result in an extensive experimental data set on the effects of global change components such as ozone on biodiversity in various herbaceous semi-natural ecosystems. Real world experiments within BIOSTRESS are focussing on selected herbaceous, semi-natural ecosystems that have high conservational value on a European, or a national, scale. Data will be used for the refinement of critical levels for ozone for the protection of semi-natural ecosystems under the UN/ECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The project will provide unique modelling tools able to run virtual experiments on the effects of global change components which can be applied to other potential drivers of biodiversity. The most important project output with respect to the European Community Biodversity Strategy is represented by a user-friendly, unique general expert system tool for vegetation science. It will provide the user, after setting of some start conditions (ozone regimes, specification of the vegetation) with a prediction of future impacts of tropospheric ozone on biodiversity in herbaceous ecosystems and enable the user to derive recommendations for future biodiversity strategies. The expert tool is designed in close cooperation with, and in accordance with the requirements of, the user community that is consulted throughout the project duration. The final expert-system model will also be made available in a simplified form on the World-Wide-Web to be used by European citizens. By this means, the project aids in creating and increasing public awareness of environmental issues related to biodiversity and to the European Community Biodiversity Strategy.",0,0

The initial predictions of there being 20,000 to 25,000 marine species in Europe were a significant underestimate. In fact, the register now contains 29,713 species, and predictions of species not listed plus species yet to be discovered indicates there are probably 38,000 marine species in European seas. The register is being published as a book, on the website, and an information pack on the project is also being published as a colour brochure.  The review of the bibliography of 842 identification guides found that there were fewer identification guides for southern European seas despite this region having more species compared to northern Europe. There were only adequate identification guides available for fish for all of Europe's seas. New guides were especially needed for the species rich but smaller sized taxa, such as polychaete, oligochaete, and turbellarian worms, and harpacticoid copepods.  The project was very successful in developing a network of expertise on marine species in Europe. This is already being built upon as part of recently funded and submitted research proposals to the EU. The published species lists will also stimulate revisions of species groups, and provide a starting point for revising and expanding future lists. The project established a database with over 600 experts in the identification of marine species (as stated by the individuals themselves). A subset of these experts was recognised by their peers as being taxonomic experts. A survey of this database of expertise found the average age of respondents was 47, and on average taxonomists tended to be older than ecologists, perhaps because of modern emphases in research funding. There was no direct correlation between the number of experts of a particular taxon and the number of species in that taxon. It was evident that some taxa with thousands of species have relatively few taxonomists.  A questionnaire survey to people with knowledge on, or hosting, collections of marine species had 80 responses. While considered representative, this does not cover every marine species collection in Europe, and a full register of all marine species collections must be the subject for future initiatives. The survey was sufficient to identify the characteristics of these collections, including the range of sizes and geographic scope. It also found that all collections, whether large or small, had a common problem of insufficient resources to maintain the collections as they wished. Most (64 %) of the collections were incompletely catalogued, and only 10 % had their catalogue in electronic form. New funding was therefore essential if knowledge and on, and availability of, collections was to be made known on the Internet.  A novel approach to address both the issues of Intellectual Property Rights and long-term management of the results was implemented. The contributors to the project founded a new scientific society of which they are all automatically members for life. It is called the 'Society for the management of European biodiversity data'. The members elect a council that will oversee and stimulate revisions and expansions of the species register, and may manage other electronic datasets if necessary. The society may provide solutions where problems are created for the management of species databases due to the changing availability of experts (e.g. due to job changes, illness, death) and/or the priorities of their employer organisations.  The ERMS project has produced the first ever checklist of marine species in Europe, yet more species remain to be discovered. With the establishment of the first database of expertise in marine species in Europe, it is apparent that there is insufficient expertise in several species-rich taxa, indeed the same taxa where most new species are predicted to be discovered. Future funding should prioritise research on the species rich, under-studied taxa so as to produce a more comprehensive set of marine species identification guides for European marine research and management. The ERMS checklist should also be updated and expanded to cover gaps in coverage of some taxa, and provide more information, especially on species names and distribution. The foundation of biodiversity research and management is correctly identifying and naming species. This Concerted Action proposal will produce a directory of marine species in Europe, linked with a bibliography of identification guides, register of taxonomic experts, locations of collections of reference specimens, and an Information Pack on European marine biodiversity. The Species Directory is novel in its geographic extent, range of taxa covered, and that it will use state-of-the-art Internet software for publication and networking. It will be drafted by experts from published literature and existing species lists, circulated to a wider range of experts for comments, revised and finally verified before publication as a book. The quality of the finished product, and its wide availability to end-users, are key elements of the project. The draft and final versions will be in the public domain and accessible across the Internet. It is anticipated that it will become a standard reference (and technological tool) for marine biodiversity training, research and management in Europe.   A special Working Group will liaise with external organisations active in biodiversity research and management, including Species 2000 (IUBS), DIVERSITAS, UNESCO-IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission), and the European marine research stations (MARS) network. The Species Directory will thus contribute to both European and global initiatives, avoid duplicating other activities, and aid national and European contributions to these organisations, to the Convention on Biological Diversity, to OSPARCOM, and to general marine environmental management. Indeed, this project would provide the first model of how the Species 2000 can link with a regional project. The linking (and future expansion) of this Species Directory with other databases, acknowledgement of individuals contributing to the Directory, and long term availability and revise-ability of the Directory will be key issues addressed by the Concerted Action.   A 1996 MAST workshop found considerable national activity in inventorying and systematics but little European co-ordination. This proposal will provide this coordination by bringing together 29 scientists from 22 organisations and 9 countries. These participants will combine their data and knowledge to produce a Species Directory of wider geographic and taxonomic scope, and greater accuracy and authority, than possible by individual efforts within the same time period. It's value will be thus greater than the sum of its components. The participants have experience in designing, constructing and managing species and marine databases, marine taxonomy (fauna and flora) and biogeography, co-ordination of large projects, publishing on electronic media (including disks and the World Wide Web), and conducting marine biodiversity research. Working Groups will also (a) analyse the data collected to identify gaps in taxonomic expertise, knowledge of certain taxa, and weaknesses of certain identification guides (including languages, quality), and (b) produce an Information Pack from the project results to aid university and public education in European marine biodiversity. This Concerted Action would thus provide a foundation for further research in marine biodiversity in Europe by both networking and producing a standard, widely available, maintained, species database.",1,1

The sources environmental aspects of pollution, however, as well as spread of pollutants downstream into the Arctic Sea, are not adequately known. In the framework of the proposed project, pollution sources of the Kola River, their harmfulness and subsequent spread will be studied in detail. Policies to mitigate pollution and a protocol for more adequate water pollution control will be worked out, to be carried out by local laboratories. As wetlands appear to be very suitable for waste water purification in cold climates, possibilities for introducing this low cost technology in the area will be estimated and pilot studies will be conducted at suitable sites.",0,1
777,106495,No,"Scalable, Secure Storage of Biobank Data","Big data is coming to Biobanks, driven by the decreasing cost of sequencing genomic data, which has been halving every 4 months since 2004. Biobanks, used to store and catalogue human biological material, are not prepared to handle this wave of data - there is a Biobank bottleneck: a lack of platform support for the storage and analysis of the coming wave of human genomic data. In this project, we will develop a cloud-computing platform as a service (PaaS) for Biobanking. The platform will provide security, storage, data-intensive tools and algorithms, and support for allowing Biobanks to share data with one another, all within the existing regulatory frameworks for Biobanking. Our research challenges include: the definition of the regulatory framework and data model for Biobank data sharing; the development of a scalable, highly available storage infrastructure; data-intensive tools and workflows for aligning, clustering, aggregating, compressing and anonymizing sequence data; a security platform that ensures data confidentiality, data integrity, and data access auditing; the inter-connection of Biobanks, while also leveraging the storage and processing capacity of public clouds; and the integration of these components as a PaaS.The project will require focused inter-disciplinary research. We have assembled a consortium containing complementary competencies, from developers and users of Biobanks to systems researchers with deep expertise in building dependable and scalable software platforms. Our platform will be evaluated and disseminated at existing Biobanks in Sweden and Germany. Our project goal is to have BiobankCloud remove the Biobank bottleneck, enabling global leadership for European Biobanks, with improved support for preventing diseases, spotting trends, and advancing our understanding of clinical and molecular pathology.",0,0
939,195478,No,Photophysics and photochemistry of light harvesting complexes in the vicinity of optical antennas,"The general objective of the project is to understand the photophysical processes in light harvesting complexes in the vicinity of optical antennas and particularly, the impact of quantum coherence on efficiency and directionality of ultrafast energy transport in photosynthesis. Purple bacteria is an organism that most effectively transforms solar energy into chemical one. Light harvesting complex 2 (LH2), plays key role in this process: collects solar energy and transfer it to the reaction centre. The photophysics of light harvesting complexes is still not fully understood. In recent years long-lived coherences were observed, which was unexpected for such complicated systems. Many crucial questions appeared: Are the coherences purely induced by excitation schemes? Do they have a biological function? Is the nature of the coherences electronic or vibrational? So far, the experimental approach concentrated on ensembles, but the complexity of the system cause that registered coherences are temporarily and spatially averaged, which makes it difficult to answer the questions. One can lift the ensemble by observation of one-by-one individual LH2 complex with single molecule (SM) spectroscopy methods. The observation of SM fluorescence requires chromophores with high quantum efficiency. Unfortunately, LH2 QE is very low. To enhance the fluorescence signal I propose to use optical antennas. These nanoscale structures, can focus electromagnetic energy to a spot of nanometric size. If the molecule is placed on such spot, the strong interaction between antenna and molecule allows the registration of enhanced SM fluorescence and even Raman spectra. With that tool, the study of LH2 complex at the SM level is possible. Hence we propose the investigation of single LH2 complex coupled to the optical antenna with ultrafast fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, two complementary methods providing information about both, ground and excited state evolution.",0,0
20,104552,Yes,Red-Med Marine Bioinvasion,"Biological invasions constitute a major global threat to indigenous communities. Marine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable as organisms can spread rapidly and are harder to detect. The invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean Sea is among the most extensively documented marine bioinvasion phenomena. The proximity of the Red Sea tropical environment and the Israeli Mediterranean rocky shore, together with the opening of the Suez Canal, present a unique geographic advantage for studying marine bioinvasion along the coasts of Israel. Comparative studies of introduced organisms from ecological, physiological, and genetic aspects can be performed readily in their native and introduced ranges. The proposed project aims to I) develop an early detection monitoring system for sessile introduced species in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, II) develop models of the dispersal patterns of non-indigenous species based on field and experimental data investigating the salinity and temperature thresholds of introduced species, and III) enhance regional sharing of information by establishing a database of marine introduced species, and by contributing scientific data to open-access databases such as The World Register of Marine Species and the Open Biogeographic Information System. Voucher specimens for future molecular and morphological work will be made available to the public. Ascidians (Phylum: Chordata) form the focus of the project due to their increasing role in altering biodiversity in fouling communities around the world, and the global rapid spread of non-indigenous ascidians. The results of this project will provide essential information to develop strategies by which to manage biological invasions in coastal marine environments, and will produce a solid essential base from which to embark on future studies on marine bioinvasion in the region.",1,1
1035,192112,No,"Continuous monitoring systems for the SAFE storage, distribution and usage of Hydrogen POWER for transport","The limited supplies of traditional fossil fuels and environmental damage caused by their CO2 emissions have caused a growing interest in the exploitation of renewable energy sources. By far the most promising replacement fuel for road transport is hydrogen because of its abundance, efficiency, low footprint for carbon and the absence of other harmful emissions. In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.  Because hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise. Particularly, the project goal is to develop novel tangential neutron radiography and acoustic emission (AE) techniques in combination for the reliable and cost effective continuous monitoring of the integrity of hydrogen storage tanks at central depots, service stations and on vehicles i.e. at every point of hydrogen storage along the supply chain from the production plant to the fuel tank on a hydrogen powered vehicle. The novelty of neutron radiography is that it exploits stored hydrogen as a contrast medium for the exposure of tank defects.",0,0
1071,16803,Yes,Characterization of the microbiological environment in hatcheries for Mediterranean marine fish : influence on larval health and development of prophylaxis.,"The aims of the project are as follows:  to establish the relationship between the microbial diversity and numbers occurring in the hatchery environment and the survival of fish larvae in the larval rearing phase;  to determine if specific fish species are more sensitive to specific pathogens, so as to provide information from which prophylactic guidelines can be drawn up and more precise targeting of preventative measures can be made;  and to establish general guidelines for prophylaxsis and treatment, irrespective of the hatchery unit or the production technology employed.  Research was carried out to elucidate the organism(s) responsible for observed mass larval mortalities in fish hatcheries, and if possible, to reveal the origin and the method of entry of these pathogens.  Only the dominant aerobic flora were considered and 1223 strains were isolated of which approximately 48% belonged to the Vibrio and related organisms.  Potential fish pathogens such as Vibrio anguillarum were shown to be associated with the rotifers and Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio alginolyticus were also occasionally found in the algal samples.  The fish larvae showed a dominance of Vibrio species in the gastrointestinal trace suggesting that in fish with a highly developed digestive tract Vibrios are indigenous.   Several candidates were considered as potential fish pathogens (V alginolyticus, Flexibacter, Pasteurella, V tubiashii, V anguillarum). V tubiashii was not thought to be responsible for the high mortalities which occurred, although it was not excluded totally. The new Vibrio species found was considered to be an atypical V ordalii. Vibrio ordalii, a major pathogen for fish. In Tinamenor V anguillarum was identified as the most likely candidate to be responsible for the observed mortalities and it is suggested that the fish get infected by this bacterium through the rotifers.   Since V anguillarum was also present in samples in which no mortality occurred it can not be concluded whether this species is a facultative or an obligate pathogen for the fish larvae studied. Histological analysis revealed that even when no mortalities occurred an infection of the internal organs took place.   It was established that some bacteria were beneficial to rotifer production cultures resulting in improved reproductive rates while some others had no effect or resulted in rotifer collapses.  Guidelines for prophylaxis were drawn up based on the results with particular emphasis placed on the live food chain. The project will be concerned with the microbiological environment surrounding the first 35 days from hatching of all the marine fin fish species cultured in the 2 hatcheries. The project will be divided into 4 phases as follows.  Standardization of methodologies for sampling procedures, analysis of material and data collection.  Sampling and identification of bacteria. This phase will conclude with an open forum workshop where initial conclusions will be drawn and a programme for phase 3 will be decided.  Testing for the pathogenicity of cultures, taken in phase 2, using the Laboratory for Aquaculture facilities in Belgium.

300,6299,No,NEW BIOCOMPATIBLE POLYMERS BASED ON CELL MEMBRANE MIMETICS,"The objective of the project was the development of new, improved haemocompatible polymers biocompatible polymers and surface treatments for implants and medical devices. The improved materials were achieved by mimicking the chemical structure of the outer surface of the red blood cell membrane. The natural membrane exhibits excellent biocompatibility and haemocompatibility.  A series of new polymers and surface treatments, which contain the same phosphorlycholine structure as the blood cell membrane has been successfully synthesized and the new compounds fully characterized. In a series of in vitro simulated in use tests, the new biomimetic polymers and surface treatments showed significantly better haemocompatibility and biocompatibility than even the best of the polymeric biomaterials in use commercially today. The benefits of this improved biocompatibility will be seen in the improved efficiency and performance of: specialized blood handling devices such as apheresis and haemodialysis filters; blood oxygenators; extracorporeal blood circuitry; intravenous and central venous catheters which will be less thrombogenic, longer indwelling the easier to introduce; improved contact and intraocular lenses; cell culture ware with improved cell attachment, growth and spreading.  The cell membrane contains a wide range of molecular species including phospholipids. It is the phospholipid components which give the membrane its structure and essential characteristics. The phospholipids in the membrane are arranged in a bilayer structure with their phosphate head groups exposed at the surface. Whilst all phospholipids carry a charge, the outer membrane surface contains 90 to 95% zwitterionic, neutral phosphorylcholine (PC) lipids. It has been shown that zwitterionic PCs do not initiate blood coagulation, whereas the other charged PCs do. It was reasoned that by attaching zwitterionic PCs to a surface, the surface would mimic that of the red blood cell membrane and th us become more haemocompatible and biocompatible. The project called for the selection and synthesis of PC containing compounds which could be either polymerized into PC polymers or used to modify other surfaces, (eg, as coatings). In the course of the research, surface reactive PC compounds, PC monomers, PC homopolymers, PC graft polymers, and PC copolymers were all successfully synthesized, characterized and attached or coated onto a range of polymeric surfaces.  In extensive in vitro haemocompatibility tests, all of the PC surfaces showed significant improvements in haemocompatibility compared untreated controls. In simulated in use tests, similarly enhanced biocompatibility resulted from the presence of the PC. The improved haemocompatibility was also confirmed in preliminary in vivo studies. THE EXTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE SURFACES OF RED BLOOD CELLS ARE EXTREMELY HAEMOCOMPATIBLE. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP POLYMERS AND SURFACE TREATMENTS WHICH MIMIC THE NATURAL SURFACE OF RED BLOOD CELLS. THE SYNTHETIC BIOMIMETIC POLYMERS AND SURFACE TREATMENTS TO BE DEVELOPED WILL BE DESIGNED TO BE NON-THROMBOGENIC AND HIGHLY RESISTANT TO PROTEIN ADSORPTION.

269,32573,No,Development of clean technologies for aircraft industry,"BE95-1154 Development of Clean Technologies for Aircraft Industry - DOCT  To meet particularly demanding specifications, the aeronautical industry implements very varied and sophisticated manufacturing processes. Among these processes, cleaning and surface preparations use large quantities of hazardous chemical compounds considered as major pollutants: organic solvents and hexavalent chromium.   The objectives are to develop new non-hazardous solvent-free cleaning processes and chromium-free surface treatments. The ways selected are:  - For the solvent-free cleaning: development of laser, plasma and blasting techniques, supercritical fluid, aqueous cleaner applicable to various kinds of materials (metal and composite) and structures (pipes, boxes, sheets). - For chromium-free surface treatment: development of new bath formulations obtained by mixing simple non hazardous chemical products adapted to pickling, dismutting, anodising and conversion of aluminium alloys.   The demonstration of feasability of such processes should result in: - A reduction in VOC's and chromium emissions by around 80%, - An estimated profit on the manufacturing costs of 40%,  - An increasing of fatigue life from 5 to 10% of anodized aluminium alloys, - A reduction of treatment cycle time around 30% for anodizing.  The research programme consists of three essential steps allowing to progressively select and improve the most adapted processes and then to validate them.  The aim of the first step is to define the parameters of the processes. It will be completely performed in laboratory, using standard specimens and standard surface conditions and contaminants.  the next step will consist in optimizing and adapting the most promising technologies selected previously to technical requirements such as real contaminants, shape of the part, improved yield, reduction in cycle times. The aim of the last step is to demonstrate the industrial feasibility by validating on the technical side, quality assurance, environment and safety levels of the previously developed processes. The selected technologies will be integrated into one single process (e.g. degreasing/pickling/anodizing or degreasing/ pickling/chemical conversion).",0,0

The Forum for European-Australian Science and Technology Cooperation (FEAST), which promotes the opportunities for cooperation to researchers in Australia and the EU was the first bilateral cooperation platform of this nature and a model for other third countries. More recently, the AUS-ACCESS4EU project has successfully promoted open programmes for European researchers and the Australian research landscape in Europe. EU and Australia have sought to strengthen the joint science relationship. Recent Joint Science and Technology Cooperation Committees (JSTCC) and associated Roadmaps have favoured a strategic approach, focusing on cooperation in mutual priority areas.

SCD or SCS extraction methods can be used for recovering or separating organic chemical products from aqueous solutions. The energy savings of these new techniques as compared to distillation can be more than 50%. They have large fields of application (e.g. downstream processing of fermentation broths to extract ethanol, acetone, butanol) and could also be important for the production of fuels such as methanol and ethanol.   The research was divided in three parts: experimental, modelling and process simulation. The experimental part focused on measurements of phase equilibria in synthetic mixtures, containing a supercritical solvent, water and an organic compound (e.g.  ethanol, propanol, butanol, acetic acid). Extraction of organic chemicals from a fermentation broth were also be carried out. Experimental data were then  correlated using a non predictive model (UDLA, University of Cadiz). A generalized model for the prediction of phase equilibria in mixtures containing a supercritical solvent and polar compounds were also developed by DTH. This model is an extension of the well established UNIFAC group contribution model. DTH integrated the developed models in steady state and dynamic process simulation computer codes (SEPSIM and DYNSIM) for the study of energy efficiency and system control of supercritical extraction processes.   In order to ensure technology transfer from the research laboratory into industry, an industrial consortium was formed. Fifteen companies such as Shell, BP, ICI, IFP, ENI, Linde, DSM participated.

102,57854,Yes,"The Virtual European Coastal and Marine Data Warehouse -CoastBase- An open system architecture for integrated, distributed coastal and marine information search and access","Coastal areas are important for a wide variety of human and natural uses. Authorities need sound information concerning these uses and the interactions between actors developing and implementing policy for integrated coastal zone management. At different policy levels within Europe, the need for tailor-made information, which is essential for sustainable marine and coastal management, has been recognised. The search and access to aggregated and interpreted information is essential, but is costly and time consuming. Mechanisms for accessing information on the European coastal zone are lacking, notably in the area of maintenance of metadata/data links to search and access data, as well as tools for filling information gaps within organisations and for facilitating information sharing. Coastbase will develop an automatically updated electronic system architecture providing multilingual search and access facilities to distributed information sources and a European coastal database 'CoastBase', holding European level products as indicators, maps and reports. Different innovative technical modules will be built to convert the content, check on quality, secure user access and aggregate the information. An essential aspect of Coastbase is the design and implementation of a Communication and Feedback mechanism among European authorities. This will automatically provide information sources with details of resulting products coming from their information and allow them to comment on the data handling, enhancing the European involvement of authorities at local up to European level.  Objectives: To develop a Virtual European Coastal and Marine Data Warehouse, using innovative techniques to improve marine and coastal environmental assessments and policy making, as well as to ensure effective, continuing pan-European co-operation on information flow.  Specific objectives include: Improve information search and exchange capabilities at different aggregation levels by development of one virtual interface (CoastBase) connecting different information sources.  Establish communication and feedback mechanisms to enhance capacity of local and regional authorities to learn from how other bodies use and apply their data. Provide authorities, research institutes, universities, private sector and public with easy internet access to CoastBase. Achieve broad acceptance and Europe-wide participation through user friendliness and a multilingual architecture. Achieve accessibility that permits interconnectivity of meta-databases and ability to query meta- and real data, while maintaining access control with the information sources.  Work description: The work involves development of technological architecture, establishment of communication and feedback mechanisms, development of user interfaces for those using and providing aggregated information on the CoastBase Server. Main elements are information search and access, aggregation and interpretation at European Level. The technical architecture development draws on recent technological developments. Development of a broad supported architecture, involving organisations at all European levels. Realising innovative architecture that provides search facilities (multilingual catalogue, index and geographical) and access to the CoastBase-server and connected information sources. A generic system will be developed to connect and automatically update local metadata and CoastBase metadata into one CDS (Catalogue of Data Sources)-based virtual frame. This allows dynamic querying of real information. Separate modules will be developed that provides automatic feedback of the information source, permitting information custodians to check and recommend improvements to information handling. Through 8 workpackages over a 2-year period, the Consortium will scope Coastbase information needs and functionality; prepare and implement a system design; test and improve the system in co-operation with the end-users; make the system publicly available. CoastBase consists of a working conceptual system architecture linking representative information sources. Europe-wide collaboration is fundamental, information is to be accessed at local, regional and national organisations.

Yet cosmological observations and theoretical arguments lead us to conclude that new phenomenology, new particles, forces, or a new space-time structure is waiting to be uncovered. Naturalness of the recently discovered Higgs boson suggests that new phenomena should appear at the tera-electronvolt (TeV) scale, and will be accompanied by modifications to the dynamics of the heaviest elementary particle known: the top quark.  The aim of this proposal is to perform five measurements involving top quarks with the data that will be collected by the ATLAS experiment at the upcoming Run II (2015-18) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): the top quark mass, the CP violation in B hadron decays from the top, the top-Z boson couplings, the search for the top's Flavour Changing Neutral decays, and the search for heavy resonances decaying to top pairs.

Last year, United Nations International Biodiversity Year, has seen the announcement that the nations of the world, including those in Europe, have failed to meet the conservation targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity and have not slowed the rate of biodiversity loss. Classical field ecology alone will not unravel these problems nor find solutions. Instead highly coordinated cross-sites studies are needed for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism driving the loss of biodiversity and device general potential solutions to restore diversity. In this context the researcher proposes GLOBEPURE. Focusing on the conservation and restoration of an important biome – diverse, functional grassland ecosystems – GLOBEPURE will inquire these challenges with powerful statistical tools and dedicated experimental manipulations. The main goals of GLOBEPURE are: To identify the specific mechanisms of changes in grassland biodiversity and functioning (acidification, nitrogen vs. phosphorus vs. potassium enrichment, increased asymmetric competition for light, etc.); And to devise and test potential solutions (combating eutrophication, overcoming dispersal and recruitment limitation, reducing dominance through use of parasitic plant species etc.). The project will use a mixture of experimental and modeling approaches and will both exploit existing databases and collect important new information. The project will bring together ecologists and environmental scientists, both pure and applied, to examine the impacts of environmental change on grassland communities and ecosystems.'",0,0

Results from this investigation will lead to i) a model for the tectonic evolution of the High Arctic, and ii) model integration with existing scenarios for the tectonic evolution of northern Eurasia and the northern Atlantic region. These objectives will be achieved with field-work (mapping and structural analysis) and geochemical analysis (elemental and isotopic) in the Polar Urals (to characterize the composition and age of the volcanic and ophiolitic sequences present, correlate them where possible, and characterize their basement), in Taimyr (to determine the time of suturing of the thrust- bounded terranes), and in Novaya Zemlya (to understand the relationship between the Baikalian orogeny and thrusting). The resulting structural, geochemical, and geochronological data will enable me to determine the tectonic provenance of the accreted terranes, reconstruct the tectonic history of the Polar Urals, and compare this evolution with existing models for northern Eurasia and possibly the northern Atlantic region. The geochemical techniques (both conventional and innovative high-resolution ion-probe) to be used include XRF for major and trace elements, IDMS for REEs, and conventional mass spectrometry for Rb/Sr, Pb/Pb, U/Pb, and Sm/Nd. Plagiogranites, xenoliths, and migmatites will be analyzed using the Cameca 1270 ion-probe at LIG.

995,43696,No,Multi Instrument Investigation of Polar Stratospheric Cloud Formati on And The Heterogeneous Chemistry Involved In Stratospheric Ozone Depletion,"The proposal describes a multi-disiplinary approach which seeks to unite stratospheric aerosol data and improved state-of-the-art atmospheric modelling tools in order to investigate polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation and the heterogeneous chemistry involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. The scientific objectives of the proposal are  - to determine the extinction spectrum of PSC particles,  - to quantify the conditions under which polar stratospheric clouds form,   - to model ozone loss in the lower stratosphere,  with the aim of providing information to build a better quantitative understanding of the ozone layer so that the present state of the layer can be explained and its future evolution predicted.The proposal involves the use of measurements from two Arctic and two Antarctic lidar stations, from an airborne lidar, from a nove] in situ backscattering device, from an optical particle counter, and rrom instruments on the 'Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and from the Improv d Lim Arrat Spectrometer (ILAS). The use of such a disparate measurement-dataset is innovative in that it will tightly constrain PSC formation and heterogeneous chemical modelling and avoid biases that can be introduced in single instrument studies. Included in the proposal are fundamental laboratory measurements of PSC particles essential to the interpretation of existing and proposed PSC data. The project aims to develop an innovative inversion algorithm to estimate key PSC properties including surface area density (which will be validated by lidar and in situ measurements) from infrared spectral measurements. A clear advance in this proposal is the sampling of high resolution satellite data along Lagrangian trajectories so that the evolution and decay of a PSC can be examined. In doing so the chemical changes within an airparcel are effectively decoupled from the dynamics allowing a clear picture of PSC formation and heterogeneous processing to be obtained. This technique has only recently become available since the rovision of UARS data and will have wide application to future European atellite instruments. Quantitative understanding of stratospheric proceesses will be expressed within a numerical model of the atmosphere which includes the best possible descriptions of the important physical and chemical processes (PSC formation, heterogeneous processing, ozone depletion) obtained from fundamental laboratory and atmospheric studies.  the work proposed addresses objectives specified in Area 1.2 of the Environment and Climate RTD workprogramme.  The overall objective of the European Community is the improved and continued welfare of its citizens. By working together a European research team will make significant advances at the frontier of our  knowledge of the atmosphere.",0,0
666,102800,No,The role of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) on the development and extend of eutrophication-driven hypoxia and responses to global warming,"Coastal hypoxia is a mounting problem worldwide that has been recognised as a major threat to marine coastal biota. The decline in dissolved oxygen can affect ecosystems structure and functioning. Managerial efforts to prevent hypoxia and recover ecosystems that have already been affected by hypoxia are largely based on nutrient reduction plans. Most nutrient reduction plans are focused on the reduction of the inorganic fraction of the nutrient loadings, particularly in reductions of nitrate and phosphate inputs. However, the concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) frequently exceeds that of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in both marine and freshwaters. Recent studies indicate that many components of the DON pool can play an active role in supplying, directly or indirectly, nitrogen nutrition to phytoplankton and bacteria and may affect community metabolic rates and species composition of the ambient microbial assemblage. Elucidate the role of DON in the development and extend of eutrophication-driven hypoxia is essential to set successful management strategies in order to reduce hypoxia development and recover ecosystems experiencing hypoxia at present, to better protect marine biodiversity. The main goal of this project is to evaluate the role of DON in planktonic and bacterial community metabolic rates, and on oxygen dynamics in the Baltic Sea, the largest coastal area suffering from eutrophication-driven hypoxia. The project also aims to evaluate the effects of global warming in the interaction between DON inputs, metabolic rates and oxygen dynamics. Predictions on effects of global warming and eutrophication in dissolved oxygen dynamics in near and far future are needed to elucidate the consequences of the lack of oxygen on biodiversity and ecosystems structure and functioning. The results of this project could help better protect marine ecosystems, preserve biodiversity and set successful management targets for coastal waters.",1,0

365,82365,No,"Long-term foraging success in an Antarctic top-predator, the Adélie Penguin: effect of individual quality, colony size and access to prey","Polar Regions are highly sensitive to climate change and this raises real concern for the future of polar ecosystems. Some of the most important signals of global climate warming have come from Antarctica, the waters surrounding of which support one of Earth's most productive marine ecosystems. As integrators of food web changes, Antarctic marine top predators are reliable indicators of changes in marine food webs. Hence, the Life Time Reproductive Success (LRS) of top predators integrates environmental variability over large spatial and temporal scales, but is also affected by individual and colonial variability.  As part of an international project on the Adélie Penguin, we therefore propose to study: (1) how individual quality is linked to differences in fo raging strategies, (2) the extent to which colony size influences the LRS, and (3) how high and low quality individuals cope with years of high environmental stress related to changing climate.  To achieve this, Ms Lescroël will work with a unique demographic data set of the Dr Ainley research group, involving 10 annual cohorts of marked birds at three colonies of disparate size in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. In known-age penguins, she will use state-of-the-art technology in the form of computerized weighbridges and passive transponders to assess body condition and foraging effort; time-depth-recorders, satellite transmitters and archival tags to identify individual foraging tactics.  This proposal would provide an exceptional opportunity to link demographic parameters and long-term data on predator provisioning strategies in a variable environment. Ms Lescroël will acquire skills in state-of-the-art analytical procedures that, when applied to CEBC-CNRS, will allow further insight into food-web response to climate change in the French Antarctic Territories. This project falls therefore into the 6th priority thematic area of FP6 and will initiate a long-term collaboration between the Dr Ainley group and the CEBC-CNRS.",1,0
403,208737,No,the unseen spaces of extended urbanization in the North Sea,"This proposal investigates the ocean as a spatial realm and the site of unfolding urbanization processes- a challenging new field within urban studies. The project aims to, 1. promote a holistic, inter-disciplinary view of the ocean which connects its geo-physical, biological and socio-economic dimensions through spatial means. Rather than a peripheral realm, or a void, the ocean is placed at the geographical and epistemological centre of current territorial developments, which represents a paradigm sift in perspective and is beyond the state of the art. The project proposes methods of spatial analysis that enable the invisible urbanization processes in ocean space to be represented, evaluated and shared as data to a range of stakeholders and academics- a new contribution to urban theory. 2. Support theoretical reflections by producing a case-study on current urbanization processes in the North Sea, in collaboration with a territorial study of North Sea settlement led by the supervisor’s chair. The two-way transfer of knowledge takes place across the land-sea threshold, demonstrating how the greater sea-space has influenced urban development. The North Sea project achieves a continuity of analysis across the interlocking land- and sea-sides – something that has never been achieved at the scale of the Sea as a whole and therefore stands to rewrite understandings of regional urbanization. 3. Critically examine and theorize the contradictory spatial dimensions of maritime transport as a sub-topic- although the backbone of globalization, consuming increasing on- and offshore areas, carrying increased loads, shipping’s spatial typologies are elusive, lacking architectural quality and interaction with urban contexts.  Through the project the researcher will profit from first-hand experience and exchange with the European hub of maritime trade and an excellent research environment, gaining new specialist knowledge in the field which is applied to enrich urban research.",0,0
637,225001,No,Prepolarized MRI at Earth Field to seek new contrasts linked to molecular events for very early detection of pathologies,"PrimoGaia opens up a new pathway in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by initiating the concept of in vivo “enzymatic imaging” for a better understanding of human physiology, early detection and prognosis of diseases, monitoring of therapeutic treatment. The main objective is to overcome current boundaries by making it possible to map and quantify the activity of an enzyme in a pathological tissue. It will be accomplished by building an MRI instrumentation operating at earth field in order to allow the use of 70MHz frequency for saturating the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) transition of Nitroxyl radicals. Enzyme activity is assessed by the use of suitable probes designed to generate the radical upon action of the enzyme of interest. Upon saturation of the radical EPR resonance, polarization is transferred to the protons of the water molecules (Overhauser MRI). The enhancement factor will be high (more than two orders of magnitude). The polarized water signal thus reports on the local concentration of the radicals that reflect the enzymatic activity. 3 lines of activity will be addressed to generate the radicals of interest, namely: i) using a radical-containing molecular precursor that, upon the action of specific enzyme, yields a radical whose absorption frequency is sufficiently different to be selectively irradiated; ii) the use of paramagnetic impurities on nanodiamond surfaces to increase the OMRI effect; iii) the use of radical precursors as “prodrugs” generating a signal only after their activation. The overall methodology will be much less expensive than the current clinical scanners and will allow distribution in developping countries. PrimoGaia brings together an interdisciplinary consortium of research teams from 4 academics: Aix-Marseille University, U Mons, U Torino (reagents), CNRS Bordeaux (EPR unit, sequences, biology); Fraunhofer (Physics) and 2 companies: “Stelar” (magnetic unit) and “Pure Devices” an innovative SME (MRI instrumentation).",0,0
333,108188,No,The role of recombination in evolution and epidemiology of bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae,"The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of the role of recombination (uptake and incorporation of foreign DNA) for the evolution and epidemiology of the major human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as the pneumococcus. There is an increasing appreciation of the public health significance of recombination in S. pneumoniae, where recombination has enabled major drug-resistant lineages to rapidly evade new conjugate vaccines. Here, I propose to investigate the role of different mechanisms of recombination in the context of (a) coevolution of the pathogen with the human immune system, (b) generation of novel antigenic diversity at the capsular locus, and (c) adaptation to clinical treatment by generation of novel bacterial lineages carrying multi-drug resistant genes and vaccine “escape” antigens. To do so, I will use an interdisciplinary approach of evolutionary microbiology, immunology, and epidemiology of infectious diseases. First, I will employ a generic evolutionary-epidemiological modelling approach to understand the population dynamic of recombination. Second, I will analyse newly available pneumococcal full-genome sequences to examine the link between recombination, immunity, vaccine, and drug-resistance in pneumococcus. The benefit of this research will be threefold. First, a better understanding of the role of recombination in coevolution with the human populations would be of benefit to the field of bacterial evolution and microbiology in general. Second, the approach outlined here can be applied to study recombination in other recombinogenic bacterial pathogens, like Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella enterica or Helicobacter pylori. Finally, gaining further insight into the predicted long-term response against the current and future vaccines would help in the design of more effective forms of clinical interventions and help saving children’ lives.",0,0

894,209575,No,Structure-function analysis of the calcium channel TRPV5,"Ion channels are proteins composed of a hydrophillic pore that facilitate ion flow across a plasma membrane. This ionic permeability is controlled by a set of essential properties affecting the channel activation and inactivation in response to voltage, ligands, or intracellular second messengers. The focus of the present project proposal, the transient receptor potential vanilloid channel (TRPV5), forms a specific category within the large TRP familiy of ion channels as it comprises a unique high selectivity for calcium ions together with a calcium-dependent inactivation mechanism that is incompletely understood. Detailed analysis of the TRPV5 channel will provide new structural insights into channel gating that can be extrapolated to other TRP channels, as the current knowledge on the TRP protein structure and its impact on the regulation of the channel function is still limited.  The key objective of my project is to deliver the first detailed mechanistic view of TRPV5 by connecting Prof. Cheng’s expertise in structural biology with my biophysical background on TRP channel functioning. The following work packages will be addressed: 1) Channel activation mechanism of TRPV5 Elucidation of the 3D structure of integral TRPV5 by single-particle cryo-EM will provide critical structural and mechanistic insight into calcium-dependent regulation of channel function. 2) Intramolecular regulation of TRPV5 Reconstitution of TRPV5 into lipid nanodiscs and liposomes allows detailed study on lipid regulation and the mechanism of channel inactivation Taken together, this project focuses on the structure-function analysis of TRPV5, a distinctive calcium-selective TRP channel. The goal is to elucidate the structure of the TRPV5 channel, and to unravel functional domains that are involved in channel function at the mechanistic level. This will ultimately advance our understanding of the molecular differences of activation, ion permeation and gating of TRP channels.",0,0
828,95689,No,"Christianity in China. Western Culture in front of the Far East. Adaptionism, Syncretism and Simulation. The specific case of a small and important group of French Jesuits: the Figurists","The Society of Jesus was the link between Europe and the Far East. This was possible thanks to the elaboration of an entirely new model of evangelization based on the assumption that cultural differences were to be “ironed out” in favor of similarities that allowed the Jesuits to enter, like a Trojan horse, the alien culture: this model was called accommodatio. The second step of this strategy was the extraordinary production of books and pamphlets written by Jesuits in the centuries of their missionary activity in the Far East. Chronicles, travel accounts, and polemical treatises accompanied the Jesuits’ mission, and found a Western audience among Enlightenment thinkers, to the point that the “discovery” of China became a fundamental point of reference of Western culture. This is the traditional account but it is necessary and possible now to verify it by using a new approach. First, it is necessary to read again the documents regarding the first penetration of Christianity in China, in the prospective of sixteenth-century European culture: literary culture of simulation or honest dissimulation in the European courts, nicodemism in religious thinking, and in the specific contest of Society of Jesus (in Europe and outside); from Matteo Ricci onwards, specially the writings of first Jesuits in China, and the regulations and discussions inside the Society. Finally, we need to look at them through the Figurists, when nicodemism or similar is replaced by a new way of cultural interpretation that really joins together the Western and Far East worlds. A bibliographical investigation of the Figurists’ writings (often not printed), their contact with European philosophes and the role they had in the Enlightenment’s evolution of concepts of China will complete the study.",0,0

188,43800,Yes,"Quantifying predation mortality rates in size-structured fish populations - effects of prey and predator sizes, prey assemblages and habitat complexity","Research objectives and content  Fish communities in northern European lakes are dominated by perch and roach. Perch become piscivorous with age, after going through planktivorous and bethivorous stages, while roach is mainly a planktivore. Habitat structure has prominent effects on competitive abilities and predator-prey interactions between the two species, determining ultimately their relative distribution and abundance. In most fish populations predator-induced mortality during early life stages may account for substantial variation in year-class strength, and may have important consequences for population and community dynamics. In many aquatic systems the main predators on fish larvae and juveniles are large fish, frequently adults of the same species. Since larval and juvenile fish undergo quick growth and fast development of sensory systems and swimming capabilities their vulnerability, for a given predator size, is expected to first increase (due to increasing conspicuousness) and then decrease (due to better escape responsiveness). The effects of predator and prey sizes, habitat structure  and alternate prey on predation mortality rates of small fish are well documented. However, it is not clear how the interaction of these factors affects predation mortality rates of prey fish and how this occurs along a continuous range of prey sizes. This project will study predation mortality rates of early stages of perch and roach as a function of their size, predator (piscivorous perch) size, habitat structure, and prey species assemblage. For this purpose the effects of the different factors on mortality rates will be studied under experimental laboratory conditions in order to quantify these relationships. Laboratory experiments will also be used to investigate in detail the predator-prey interaction during the attack and prey manipulation episodes. Finally, the laboratory results will be compared to field observations (whole lake experiments), which will show how well small scale experiments can be extrapolated to whole systems. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  My work up to the present has been centered on different aspects of the biology and ecology of brown trout, based on fish sampling in streams, and including some experimental work on predation. The proposed post-doctoral study will expand my development as a scientist by providing an opportunity to go deeply into experimental work (on which the host group has considerable experience), within the context of a rich background of experimental and sampling based work. It will also provide me an opportunity to work with different fish species (subjected to different climatic conditions), and lakes in contrast with streams. The project proposal fits in with the host group interests, and is a key component of the modelling efforts on size-structured interactions currently underway. With respect to my future goals, I hope to obtain substantial experimental and theoretical expertise from the post-doc stay, and eventually be able to translate similar studies to local systems within my own country.",1,1
606,45856,No,Reduction of the fluid lubricant use in heavy loaded motion transmission systems through the application of self-lubricant coatings,"- Improved Graphit-iC and MoST coating formulations able to work at combined rolling-sliding line contacts loaded up to 1,6 GPa, with sliding speed up to 7.6 m/s and specific lubricant film thickness as low as 0.08-0.10, have been developed by TEER. At pure rolling tribological contacts MoST coatings are able to bear hertzian pressures up to 3 GPa with an excellent fatigue resistance. Moreover, these coating materials can be used in combination with oil lubricants free of toxic and environmentally unacceptable extreme pressure (EP) and anti-wear additives.  - A new TiCx-based coating material has been also developed. These coatings exhibit good wear resistance at very low specific lubricant film thickness (0.05 at 1.46 GPa of hertzian pressure). However, TiCx-based coatings need EP and anti-wear additives in the fluid lubricant. Otherwise, their functional performance falls dramatically.  - Combining parts coated with a self-lubricant material based on MoS2 and an oil-air lubrication systems, where oil is added periodically to an uninterrupted air stream, a new generation of ballscrews for machine-tool applications have been developed by SHUTON. These new ballscrew systems are able to reach a D*N factor up to 120.000 mm*rpm.  Prototype gearboxes containing gears coated with Graphit-iC and MoST coatings are available. These gearboxes are able to run with a significantly reduced amount of lubricant fluid without any additional risk of adhesive wear or metal-metal seizure. Usually heavy loaded motion transmission systems, like gearboxes and ballscrews, avoid risk of metal metal contact failures by supplying to the system an excess of hydraulic fluid. However, a such quantity of lubricant is only need for the most critical situations of the mechanical system life, namely, when motion is starting or stopping, and the elastohydrodinamic lubrication regime is not stable. Otherwise only a low percentage of the usual lubricant amount is enough to prevent wear and part damages. On the other hand, if the lubricant fluid is significantly reduced, several benefits can take place. For motion transmission systems running at high speed an excess of fluid involves frictional resistance and it limits the maximum effective working speed of the mechanical system. In all cases, hydraulic fluids are a major source of waste generation and imply expensive disposal costs. The aim of the project is to reduce dramatically hydraulic fluids used for loaded motion transmission systems by saving lubrication failure risks by mean of low friction high resistant coatings. At present there exist MoS2/metal, Diamond like carbon and TiC coatings able to carry out this job. They are already being used ;n the aerospace industry and recently start to be applied for cutting and forming tools. The proposed approach of the project is to evaluate their performance for this new potential field of application using laboratory simulation tribological tests and practical tests on real parts. Then specific coating solutions will be developed for those systems where presently available products were nor resistant enough.",0,0
