529,198798,Yes,European AIDS Vaccine Initiative 2020,"HIV-1 is responsible for a global pandemic of 35 million people, and continues to spread at a rate of >2 million new infections/year. It is widely acknowledged that a protective vaccine would be the most effective means to reduce HIV-1 spread and ultimately eliminate the pandemic, while a therapeutic vaccine may help mitigate the clinical course of disease and lead to strategies of viral eradication. However despite 30 years of research, we do not have a vaccine capable of protecting from HIV-1 infection or impacting on disease progression. This in part represents the challenge of identifying immunogens and vaccine modalities with reduced risk of failure in late stage development. To overcome this bottleneck some of the most competitive research groups in vaccine discovery from European public institutions and biotechs from 9 EU countries together with top Australian and Canadian groups and US collaborators, have agreed to join forces in EAVI, providing a pool of international expertise at the highest level. EAVI2020 will provide a platform for the discovery and selection of several new, diverse and novel preventive and/or therapeutic vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS. Emphasis will be placed on early rapid, iterative, small Experimental medicine (EM) human vaccine studies to select and refine the best immunogens, adjuvants, vectors, homologous and heterologous prime–boost schedules, and determine the impact of host factors such as gender and genetics. Animal models will be used to complement human studies, and to select novel immunization technologies to be advanced to the clinic. To shift the “risk curve” in product development we will develop innovative risk prediction methods, specifically designed to reduce the risk associated with late stage preventive or therapeutic vaccine failure, increasing the chance of discovery of an effective vaccine.",1,1
421,104641,No,Ambiguity in Foreign Language Vocabulary Learning,"Understanding the pattern of interactions between the languages of multilingual speakers, and the mechanisms supporting efficient learning of a foreign-language are imperative in today's global society. For one, the majority of individuals in the world use more than one language in their daily lives. Second, many individuals are required to learn a foreign-language as adults, to be able to acquire higher education, to advance in the work place, and the like. Developing efficient instruction methods is thus an essential endeavour. The proposed work will address both of these issues, focusing on learning and representation of words. The mapping between lexical-form and word meaning(s) is often ambiguous both within a language and across languages. Such indirect mappings pose particular difficulty for vocabulary learning, because learners need to achieve stable links between the to-be-learned lexical form and an unequivocal specification of its meaning. The proposed project focuses on this challenge, and examines it's consequences for first-language representation. The first objective is therefore to explore the consequences of foreign-language vocabulary learning on meaning representation of first-language words. Such backward influences are theoretically important because they speak to the dynamic and interconnected nature of the bilingual lexicon. The second objective is to improve foreign-language vocabulary learning by (1) identifying ambiguity types that create challenges for learning, and (2) test different instruction methods tailored at alleviating the difficulty associated with these ambiguity types. The third objective is to examine how learner's characteristics interact with this particular complexity. We focus on (1) individual differences in working memory span and the ability to ignore irrelevant information and on (2) language experience, comparing how monolingual and multilingual speakers deal with ambiguity in learning.",0,0

566,222189,Yes,"Embodied Ecologies: An Ethnographic Study of Reproductive Toxicity, Infertility, Endometriosis and Delayed Childbearing","'This ethnographic project reframes the study of infertility by considering reproductive health as an environmental issue. It is specifically interested in the relationship between exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), infertility, and endometriosis, a common hormonal disorder that disrupts the female menstrual cycle and is strongly correlated with both infertility and EDCs. How are these links understood in expert and public contexts, and how do they factor into the way people make decisions about fertility and childbearing? By focusing on understandings of causality instead of treatments/technologies, and by conceptualizing health as an 'embodied ecology' instead of a product of individual choices and behaviors, this project has implications for health policy and public awareness as well as anthropological theory. Working with Diana Marre at the AFIN Research Group at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, the pre-eminent site for the interdisciplinary social study of reproduction, will provide me with the support and training to conduct this innovative research and reach professional maturity. Over twenty months of fieldwork consisting of interviews and participant observation in Barcelona, Europe's leading site for infertility treatments, with short fieldwork trips to California for an important comparative perspective, this project connects my prior experience researching reproductive decisions in California with demographic and health challenges affecting Europe and Western societies more broadly. Training will focus on proliferating my methodological skills and enhancing my ability to communicate across sectors and to the public, which will be enabled by AFIN's inter-sectoral connections with medical centers and its unique Center devoted to public outreach. Dissemination will consist primarily of three peer-reviewed articles, six conference presentations, two public talks, and two public newsletters.'",1,1
434,17298,No,European Initiative in Library and Information in Aerospace,"The overall objective of the EURILIA project is to enhance the Libraries R&D and education process in the aerospace sector. For this purpose a new service will be established, based on a pan-European system for information access, retrieval, image browsing and document delivery. This will in turn extend the access and availability of major aerospace collections.  It will develop effective networking links between all EURILIA participants, using a current standard open telecommunications network infrastructure. These links will be used for direct access to the OPACs of significant aerospace collections, based on a standard user interface built on the ISO SR (Z39.50) standard. Document browsing and delivery will be by conventional and electronic image format.  These links will then be used to evaluate the use of the network as a channel for the transmission of document requests and images. Software will be developed to manage these procedures. Parallel with this process, a programme of systematic record access in combination with advanced information retrieval software will be undertaken. Impact and expected results:  EURILIA will demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-site, multi-country document delivery system, with standard user interface and image browsing features, in aerospace libraries. Such a system, by making aerospace related information more easily, more accurately and more extensively available, will facilitate the research and education process in that sector. This in turn will contribute significantly towards European competitiveness in this key industry.  Although the service will be developed for the aerospace industry, it will be applicable to other sectors.  Different pricing systems will be tested in order to minimise cost and maximise benefit and viability of the service.  At the end of the project a workshop will be organised.  Deliverables  A report on the results and analysis of the pre-project audit, including an evaluation of commercial aspects, is currently available. The prototype system and service are classified as restricted or confidential.  Within the public domain, in line with project progress, will be:  A report on the post-project audit results, with a re-evaluation of commercial aspects; Final report. Technical approach:   The project has five workpackages: Pre- and post project audits to determine the effect of EURILIA on its sector and evaluate its commercial aspects; User application to investigate, specify and implement the core EURILIA network infrastructure and user software; OPAC SR access to implement a standard SR access service and demonstrate it on two OPACs; Image access developing the user application to provide remote image browsing to a prototype image service; DDS access with development and demonstration of integrated conventional and Group IV fax image document delivery.

697,213208,Yes,Acoustic Blood Cells Sorter,"Blood transfusion is central to public health: globally, 45 million people are transfused each year with Labile Blood Products (LBP). Blood Banks produce the LBP from donated human blood, which makes it a highly valuable resource. Today, blood banks face two major concerns: 1) increase in blood processing cost, due to ever increasing regulatory requirements; 2) therapeutic quality of their LBP. No disruptive innovation appeared on the market of blood fractionation devices for more than 30 years. Aenitis Technologies develops and designs innovative patented devices for continuous, contactless and pressureless cell sorting, using acoustic forces (acoustophoresis). The Aenitis’ ABC-S project (a follow-up of SME Instrument – Phase 1) will be a game changer: it proposes a completely new blood fractionation approach based on acoustophoresis that simplifies the LBP production process, while increasing the LBP quality. Indeed, our approach allows a drastic process optimization, which does not increase the platelets’ activation level, thus making the platelets more efficient and expanding their shelf life. ABC-S is a revolution in the market of blood processing devices. We already obtained the support from 2 major blood banks – the French Blood Agency and Héma-Québec in Canada, documented by letters. Thanks to this SME Instrument project, by 2024, we aim to sell to blood banks worldwide via distributors, generate sales over €52M, and hire a team of 48 direct collaborators. We have already prepared the access to the European market with 2 global market leaders and distributors that confirmed ABC-S high potential (cf. Appendix): Fresenius Kabi, n°1 world actor in whole blood fractionation devices and Macopharma, n°3 world actor in whole blood fractionation disposables. ABC-S will be on the European market at the end of the project before to tackle the global market.",1,1
905,99575,No,Antecedents and Consequences of Mental Health Problems in Juvenile Justice Boys and Girls,"About 65-70% of the incarcerated juveniles have a mental disorder. Juveniles in justice settings have significantly more often a mental disorder compared to their peers without juvenile justice contacts. Only about a third of the juvenile justice youth with a psychiatric disorder have received prior treatment in the community. Some evidence exists that mental health problems are predictive of reoffending. Knowledge on mental health problems in juvenile justice is crucial in order to be able to treat delinquent youngsters adequately and to prevent reoffending. Not much is known about which risk factors are linked to particular mental disorders in justice-involved juveniles and to what extent mental health problems are related to future offending patterns. The current project aims 1) to demonstrate which risk factors explain mental health problems in juvenile justice youth, 2) to determine how mental health problems are linked to patterns of future reoffending, and 3) to identify potential gender differences in antecedents and consequences of mental disorders in juvenile justice youth. To reach the objectives I will bring together knowledge from criminology, developmental psychology and psychiatry and will be supervised by a multidisciplinary team. The investigation and training will take place in an outgoing phase of 1 year at the Columbia University NYSPI and a return phase at the University of Amsterdam CDE. At Columbia extensive expertise and data on psychiatric disorders in juvenile justice is present, which is not available in the Netherlands. The training abroad will enable me to conduct research on mental disorders in juvenile justice in Europe, which is important for scientific and societal purposes. The expertise on mental health issues in juvenile justice is very relevant for European countries, given that mental health problems in juvenile justice youth are significant and concerns with regard to serious juvenile delinquency and public safety are high.",1,0
938,98465,No,Low Emission Gas Turbine Technology for Hydrogen-rich Syngas,"The overall objective of this project is to provide and demonstrate technical solutions which will allow the use of state-of-the-art highly efficient, reliable gas turbines in the next generation of IGCC plants, suitable for combusting undiluted hydrogen-rich syngas derived from a pre-combustion CO2 capture process, with high fuel flexibility. The recognised challenge is to operate a stable and controllable gas turbine on hydrogen-rich syngas with emissions and process parameters similar to current state-of-the-art natural gas turbine engines. This objective will have severe implications on the combustion technology, hot gas path materials, the aerodynamic performance of turbomachinery components, and the system as a whole. The project will address these issues in Subprojects: SP1: Combustion; SP2: Materials; SP3: Turbomachinery and SP4: System analysis. In addition, the project will also look into gas turbine fuel flexibility, which will be demonstrated in order to allow the burning of back-up fuels, such as natural gas, without adversely affecting the reliability and availability. This is an important operational requirement to ensure optimum use of the gas turbine. The H2-IGCC project – coordinated by the European Turbine Network - gathers the whole value chain of gas turbine power plant technology, including Original Equipment Manufacturers, GT users/operators and research institutes with diverse key expertise needed to fulfil the objectives. Successful dissemination and implementation of the results will open up the market for IGCC with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), as it will improve the commercial competitiveness of IGCC technology. In particular, the integrated approach used in the project will enhance confidence and significantly reduce deployment times for the new technologies and concepts developed in this project. The vision is that this will allow for the deployment of high efficiency gas turbines in competitive IGCC plants with CCS technology by 2020.",0,0
987,103293,No,Mobility Optimization: Permits for Emissions from Driving,"'Road congestion and emissions are seen as having increasing negative impacts on travelers, environment and economy as a whole. All the evidence suggests that the current trends are not sustainable without effective management of travel demand, and the world will have to confront a series of traffic congestion and air pollution problems caused principally by the unrestricted use of private cars. This proposal will focus on urban travel demand management and propose strategies of managing transport network mobility and reducing congestion and emissions with tradable permits. Firstly, methodological developments focus on transport network equilibrium analysis, traffic bottleneck analysis, greenhouse gas emissions evaluation, traffic flow modelling and algorithms design, and tradable permits market equilibrium will be studied; Secondly, social and spatial equities in the multiple user-classes (with different values of time) network models with tradable permits schemes are further discussed; Finally, a sustainable transport system with tradable permits will be designed and case studies will be implemented in typical cities in EU and other countries with the supports of transport management departments of local government, therefore, innovative and interoperable information and communication technologies based services for smart mobility will be brought, which will also bring low carbon futures by improving the efficiency of vehicle using. This proposal will bring many open and potential value avenues of further studies, and create long term collaborations and mutually beneficial cooperation between Europe and the other countries with existed relationships. The requirements of innovative information and communication technologies will also bring potential public private partnerships in support of industrial competitiveness, and provide a sustainable transport development patterns respond the needs of citizens and support transport policy development.'",0,0
152,214014,Yes,Omics integration for precision cancer immunotherapy,"The development of immunotherapies based on checkpoint inhibitors marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer, with 20-30% of tumor response in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer and melanoma. However, the rational use of these agents has been limited by the lack of definitive predictive biomarkers. The recent “omics revolution” provides great opportunities to elucidate the biological processes linked to the treatment outcome. Here we propose a multilayer integrative omics analysis using transcriptomics and genetic and epigenetic mapping, together with detection of specific immunologic proteins, to identify biomarkers of clinical response to immunotherapy amenable to be used in liquid biopsies. Objective: to identify definite biomarkers predictive of the response to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA4 therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma and advanced non–small-cell lung cancer. We structure the proposal in two parts: WP1. Signature of response to the immunotherapy by integrating transcriptomics and genetic and epigenetic mapping in tumor tissues: solid biopsy. Genome-wide transcriptomics on FAC-sorted tumor and stroma cells followed by targeted genetic and epigenetic mapping in the differentially expressed genes in responders. WP2: Identification of circulating biomarkers of response to the immunotherapy: liquid biopsy. Pre- and post-treatment blood samples from a validation cohort will be used as liquid biopsy. Genetic and epigenetic biomarkers of WP1 will be tested as circulating biomarkers. In addition, LINE-1 methylation, total Circulating Tumor Cells, CD56\, or CD8\ PD-1\ cells will be tested. This project applies multiple innovative approaches to address the urgent need of identifying biomarkers of clinical response to immunotherapy in cancer, amenable to be used non-invasively. In line with the Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation goal, we will “improve our ability to monitor health and to prevent, detect, treat and manage disease.",1,1
990,75836,No,Cost effective inspection and structural maintenance for ship safety and environmental protection throughout its life cycle,"For oil tankers to be more environmentally friendly along their life cycle, IMO has set forth a condition assessment scheme 'CAS' for single hull tankers and is now working to develop a similar type of codefor double hull tankers, which involve huge amounts of measurement information. Performing thoseinspections efficiently requires processing measurement information on a real time basis, resulting incost savings because fast assessment of the ship condition and decision-making could be done while theship is still in the dock for maintenance.Measurement information consists of thickness measurements, visual assessment of coating and cracksdetection. In the existing situation, because there is no standardization of data, it is recorded manuallyon ship drawings or tables, which are very difficult to handle. Measurement information takes a longtime to report and to analyse, leading to some repairs being performed at the next docking of the ship.The system to be developed in this project includes such innovative features as: development of a simplified andflexible ship electronic model which can be refined to fit the needs of inspections, addition of measurementinformation in this ship model, automatic updating of the measurement information in the ship model, integrationof robotics, easy handling of measurement information using virtual reality, immediate worldwide access. Systematic comparison and consistency checks of measurement campaigns will trigger electronic alerts. Repairdecisions and residual lifetime of the structure will be calculated with modern methods of risk based maintenance modelling, with the interesting feature that the model will be updated after each measurementcampaign. The system to be developed is applicable to any ship type, but, due to the current focus on tankers and bulkcarriers, these ships will be used as the main case studies.",0,0
526,207225,Yes,Optimizing a deployable high efficacy malaria vaccine,"A highly effective malaria vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum should help prevent half a million deaths from malaria each year.  New vaccine technologies and antigen discovery approaches now make accelerated design and development of a highly effective multi-antigen multi-stage subunit vaccine feasible.  Leading malariologists, vaccine researchers and product developers will here collaborate in an exciting programme of antigen discovery science linked to rapid clinical development of new vaccine candidates.  Our approach tackles the toughest problems in malaria vaccine design: choice of the best antigens, attaining high immunogenicity, avoiding polymorphic antigens and increasing the durability of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. We take advantage of several recent advances in vaccinology and adopt some very new technologies:  sequencing malaria peptides eluted from the HLA molecules, parasites expressing multiple transgenes, multi-antigen virus-like particles constructed with new bonding technologies, delayed release microcapsules, and liver-targeted immunisation with vaccine vectors. We enhance our chances of success by using a multi-stage multi-antigen approach, by optimising the magnitude and durability of well-characterised immune responses to key antigens, and using stringent infectious challenges and functional assays as established criteria for progression at each stage. The consortium comprises many of the foremost researchers in this field in Europe with leading groups in the USA, Australia and Africa. We link to EDCTP programmes and harmonise our timeline to fit with the recent roadmaps for malaria vaccine development.  We include a major pharma partner and several excellent European biotech companies helping enhance Europe’s leading position in the commercial development of vaccines. This ambitious and exciting programme should have a high chance of success in tackling the major global health problem posed by malaria.",1,1
269,202590,No,Solar Energy Enabled for the World by High-resolution Imaging,"THE GOAL We will derive new and fundamental insight in the relation between nano-scale structure and the performance of 3rd generation solar cells, and determine how to apply this in large-scale processing. THE CHALLENGES We currently have a superficial understanding of the correlations between structure and performance of photovoltaic heterojunctions, based on studies of small-scale devices and model systems with characterization techniques that indirectly probe their internal structure. The real structures of optimized devices have never been “seen”, and in devices manufactured by large-scale processing, almost nothing is known about the formation of structures and interfaces. THE SCIENCE We will take a ground-breaking new approach by combining imaging techniques where state of the art is moving in time spans on the order of months, with ultrafast scattering experiments and modelling. The techniques include high resolution X-ray phase contrast and X-ray dark-field tomography, in situ small and wide angle X-ray scattering, resonant scattering and imaging and time resolved studies of charge transport and transfer. To relate our findings to device performance, we will establish full 3D models of charge generation and transport in nano-structured solar cells. THE FOCUS Solution cast solar cells is the only technology that promises fast and cheap industrial scaling, and it is consequently the focus of our efforts. They require a tight control of processing conditions to ensure that the proper nano-structure is formed in the photoactive layers, with optimal contacts to charge transport layers and interfaces. The prime contenders are non-toxic polymer and kesterite solar cells. THE IMPACT Our results may advance 3rd generation, solution-cast solar cells to meet the “unification challenge” where high efficiency, stability and cheap processing combines in a single technology, scalable to the level of gigawatts per day, thus becoming a centrepiece in global energy supply.",0,0
898,12770,No,OPTIMIZATION OF THE MATERIALS COMPOUND FOR CEMENTING THE MAINS IN THE GEOTHERMAL WELLS WITH HIGH ENTHALPY.,"TO DEVELOP CEMENTS FOR THE CASING OF GEOTHERMAL WELLS WHICH CAN RETAIN THEIR PROPERTIES WHEN EXPOSED TO TEMPERATURES IN THE RANGE 150-350 DEGREES CELSIUS, PRESSURES OF 50 MPA AND BRINE SALINITES UP TO 250 DEGREES GAY LUSSAC.  Cementing materials laid in a casing formation annulus must be stable and maintain the necessary physical characteristics during the entire life of the well. The purpose of this study was to select the best components for formulating cement relative to conditions at the bottom of the hole. The long term behaviour of materials already laid in wells, or likely to be laid in them, was determined under the combined effects of temperature, pressure and formation fluid type. Bottom hole conditions were simulated in a laboratory apparatus which was specially designed to withstand high pressures (up to 50 MPa) and high temperatures (up to 350 C) and which provided long term resistance to corrosive fluids.   Various materials have been studied including hydraulic cements standardised by the American Petroleum Institute, experimental hydraulic cements, which are easy to market, and thermosetting organic resins. A classification by quality has been drawn up, based on mechanical resistance levels, hardened material permeability and long term stability. Results depended on the bottom hole conditions. In certain cases (vapour at 200 C approximately) the phenolic furanic resin based compositions have proven to be more stable than those prepared with hydraulic binders. Even though development is limited, the application of physical techniques (X-ray tomography, scanning microscopy, analysis with a Castaing probe) to materials hardened with a hydraulic binder base has made it possible to establish a relationship between the change in characteristics and the change in structure.  The tightness of the casing formation annulus is a safety condition of prime importance for both oil and geothermal wells. It prevents formation fluid channelling from one formation to another or to the surface of the well. After cementing materials have been pumped into the casing formation annulus, they must maintain suitable characteristics during the entire lifetime of the well. This study concerns the long term behaviour of some actual or potential cementing compositions after they have been cured and hardened under bottomhole conditions.  Bottomhole conditions were simulated by specially designed laboratory equipment, including high pressure (up to 50 MPa) and high temperature (150 to 350 C) cells capable of withstanding long term exposure to aggressive fluids. Several types of materials were considered, including American Petroleum Institute (API) well cements, experimental hydraulic cements with a specified composition, and an organic phenol-formol-furan resin. Behaviour during aging is characterized by compressive strength and water permeability. Scanner tomographic analyses were performed on some specimens, giving a cartographic representation of density and porosity.  Class G cement silica systems which are characterized by a 2:3 silica cement ratio still maintained suitable performances at 345 C, at least for short time aging. However, above 150 C, tomographic analyses revealed a heterogeneity of the specimens due to slurry particle settling and probably to differences in the local structure of the cement. Class J cement did not seem to have better performances than class G cement silica systems.  A steam environment was unfavourable for a class G cement silica system and for a class J cement. Indeed, permeability increased very fast between 3 and 6 months after cementing. Under the same conditions, cements with aluminous slag were less damaged and their water permeability was only slightly modified. The first tests with the phenol-formol-furan r esin seem to be hopeful. THE WORK, WHICH IS AN EXTENSION OF WORK PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACT NO.EG-B1-008-F, WILL INVESTIGATE IN THE LABORATORY THE BEHAVIOUR OF DIFFERENT CEMENT FORMULATIONS UNDER THE COMBINED EFFECT OF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HIGH FLUID SALINITY. THE CEMENTS TO BE TESTED WILL INCLUDE THOSE IDENTIFIED UNDER THE EARLIER CONTRACT AND OTHER CEMENT BASES WHICH ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BUT WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN EVALUATED.",0,0
494,22045,No,Underwater Intelligent Operation and Navigation,"To achieve greater autonomy many robotics systems designed for complex and hostile surroundings require the integration of disparate subsystems, such as locomotion systems, manipulation sets and a wide range of sensors.   Underwater technology is a framework within which one can explore the best way to integrate disparate and heterogeneous sensing and acting sub-systems in order to perform autonomous intelligent operation and navigation tasks. UNION aims to build coordinated control strategies for heterogeneous vehicle-manipulators systems, to integrate data from different sensors, and to study man-machine interface and programming tools to manage a mission and all the systems involved in it.  APPROACH AND METHODS   On the one hand, previous European projects (Eureka 191.MAZSTI 900030, MAST2, 920021 and 920028) led to the feasibility for autonomous underwater vehicle development from global architectural point of view, with partial validation on an experimental demonstrator. On the other, research into the information and signal processing aspects, and control schemes for autonomous ground vehicles is much more mature with theoretical and methodogical approaches implemented on numerous laboratory prototypes (PANORAMA, MARIE CIN, FIRST, INSIGHT, ERS's, ESPRIT II). The approach and methods used in UNION consist in a merge of research in ground robot control, programming, navigation, perception and manipulation, with operational subsea technology. It aims to build a coherent framework for theoretical and methodological control and perception functions design.

214,110153,Yes,DNA-TRAP – Delivery of Nucleic Acid-Based Therapeutics for the TReatment of Antibiotic-Resistant Pathogens,"Antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, have dramatically reduced the number of deaths from infectious diseases over the last 70 years. However, through overuse and misuse of these agents, many micro-organisms have developed antimicrobial resistance. Oligonucleotide therapeutics have the potential to become the new class of antibacterials capable of treating a broad range of infections. By acting on novel targets, they circumvent current resistance mechanisms and with judicious use, can suppress the rise of future resistance.  DNA-TRAP will build on a platform technology that uses proprietary nucleic acid-based Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) that act on novel genomic targets by capturing key regulatory proteins to block essential bacterial genes and defeat infection. Taking forward newly emerging insights and expertise that exists within each of the partners and through the mutual secondment of researchers, the project aims to develop a new class of nanoparticulate antibacterials capable of meeting the clinical challenge of drug-resistant infections such as Clostridium difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  DNA-TRAP will establish a lasting, international partnership for transfer of knowledge between Industry and Academia in the field of nanomedicine. Exchange of knowledge and expertise between the partners is key to establishing the fundamental properties of nanostructured drug delivery systems to treat bacterial infections and through this, provide the basis for building a manufacturing platform to advance the experimental therapeutic into clinical trials.  17 researchers in the field of drug development and delivery from 2 commercial (SME) and 2 non-commercial partners across 2 member states, will have the opportunity to share and acquire new complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge, through inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary exchange, allowing for the development of new solutions and the establishment of further joint research projects.",1,1
729,97996,Yes,"Determinants of eating behaviour in European children, adolescents and their parents","Nutrition-related diseases caused a loss of over 56 million years of healthy life of European citizens in 2000. I.Family will make a significant contribution to reduce this burden by studying the interplay and impact of the main drivers of dietary behaviour and food choice. It will take advantage of the unique opportunity to follow-up the large IDEFICS children’s cohort to not only provide added value by maintaining the existing cohort but also, exceptionally, assess the dynamic nature of causal factors over time and during transition into adolescence. The project’s acronym indicates its focus on the individual and its family. By re-assessing children and their parents I.Family will compare families who developed or maintained a healthy diet with those whose diet developed in an unfavourable direction to study the impact of biological, behavioural, social and environmental factors on dietary behaviour over time. Focus will be on the family environment, socio-behavioural and genetic factors determining familial aggregation. Subgroups with contrasting dietary profiles will undergo an enhanced protocol including measurement of brain activation, expression of genes related to food choice, biological and genetic basis for taste thresholds, role of sleep, sedentary time, physical activity and impact of the built environment. I.Family will also link health outcomes like body composition and cardio-metabolic markers to diet and interacting factors to determine their prognostic value. Thus I.Family provides strength of methodology, breadth of coverage and depth of investigation across the ecological model. Guided by research on ethical implications I.Family will be deriving effective communication strategies to empower European consumers to induce behaviour changes, supported by novel web-based, interactive personalised feedback on dietary behaviour. By building on existing success I.Family will take the research on dietary behaviour to the next level in a short time frame.",1,1

812,223193,No,FLIGHT PHASE ADAPTIVE AERO-SERVO-ELASTIC AIRCRAFT DESIGN METHODS,"Flight Phase Adaptive Aero-Servo-Elastic Aircraft Design Methods (FliPASED) opens a complete new dimension for the integrated aircraft design. Coupling between aeroelasticity, gust response, flight control methods, instrumentation and certification aspects is not exploited in current aircraft design. A common set of models, coupled with joint requirements enable a multidisciplinary-optimized design for the entire aircraft, leading to more optimized overall performance. The concept of exploiting coupling between disciplines will take advantage of tools developed by the partners in former projects. The main objectives of the proposal aim at tightly coupled multi-objective optimization of advanced, active controlled wing designs through the integration of a collaborative design tool chain. More than 10% fuel efficiency improvement, and 20% reduction in peak amplitude of the gust response, as well as a 50% reduction of number of distinct models used during the development and certification process are set as project goals. Through the integration of all discipline tools from aerodynamics, structural design, aeroelastic simulation and control design in one integrated tool chain an active, condition optimized wing design becomes feasible, enabling enhanced performance at lower weight and cost. The project will raise the efficiency of a currently separately existing development toolchains, by advanced multidisciplinary and collaborative capabilities for whole aircraft along its life cycle. It will develop methods and tools for very accurate flexible-mode modelling and flexible aircraft control synthesis, in the context of reliable implementation of the avionics system, taking into consideration the fault detection and reconfiguration. The accuracy of developed tools and methods will be validated on a safe and affordable experimental platform, and results will be shared along with design requirements and standardized interfaces in an open source approach.",0,0

332,89457,No,Forging Identities: The Mobility of Culture in Bronze Age Europe,"This ITN will continue and enhance the success of a recent RTN ‘The Emergence of European Communities (2-2001-00366)’: Several PhDs have been educated and new knowledge has been unearthed concerning the economic and political foundations of intercultural interaction in Bronze Age Europe – a golden epoch  between 3000 and 500 BC with new patterns of social identification, specialised production, complex polities and wide-reaching interaction networks across Europe.       However, new questions have been evoked: 1. How did cultural mobility impact on the social life of settlements? 2. How did the movement of people, animals, plants, things, ideas, and knowledge take place and on what scale? 3. How were European and regional identities forged through interaction? These and other questions – grown out of the preceding RTN – will be researched by building on a continued European network and by using a similar cross-disciplinary methodology combining archaeology, natural science and sociology. This shared platform shall create knowledge of the mobility of people and culture – including the new metal bronze – and insight into the forging of European and regional identities that shaped this remarkable period.      The ITN is expected to change current archaeological perspectives from national traditionalism towards transnational and cross-disciplinary engagements. It consists of 7 network partners and 11 associated partners. Network partners have considerable capacities in research training and will provide supervision and facilities for the employed ESRs and ERs. They will cooperate with each other in organising workshops, training courses, and summer schools. Associated partners will provide extra supervision, field sites, data, and secondments offering specific training facilities in archaeology and front-line sciences. Field schools will take place each summer.",0,0
569,216803,Yes,A novel ulcerative colitis treatment - A phase III ready feasibility study,"InDex Pharmaceuticals AB is a pharmaceutical development company based at the Karolinska Institutet Science Park in Stockholm, Sweden. The company´s primary asset is cobitolimod, which is in late phase clinical development as a new medication to treat moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis (UC); a chronic, debilitating disease with a high unmet medical need. UC is caused by chronic inflammation of the colon, and there is no cure.   Cobitolimod offers a novel and unique mechanism of action for the treatment of UC, and has demonstrated a higher efficacy and better safety profile in clinical studies than what has been reported for currently approved biological drugs. Cobitolimod is part of the broad InDex portfolio of DNA-based ImmunoModulatory Sequences (referred to as DIMS), which have the potential for treatment of various immunological diseases. Cobitolimod is currently being tested in a phase IIb clinical study with top line results expected in Q4 2018.   InDex’s business strategy is to out-license cobitolimod to a larger international pharmaceutical company prior to the initiation of clinical phase III development. This will generate revenues for InDex from upfront and milestone payments as well as royalties from third party sales, which can then be reinvested in the company to finance development of new compounds from the DIMS technology platform.  For clinical phase III, additional manufacturing and toxicology work as well as commercial preparations are essential. The planning and preparation of this work is the purpose of this feasibility study, which is a crucial part of the cobitolimod phase III ready programme, increasing the attractiveness of the asset in partnering discussions with pharmaceutical companies looking for innovative new products. A licensing deal will ensure that the development of this promising, innovative drug will continue in a fast and efficient way to reach patients with this debilitating disease.",1,1
343,80143,No,Promote Confidence in Future Information Technologies for the Valorisation of European Research Infrastructures,"While plenty of commercial test solutions exist on the market to address complex telecom protocols, these solutions are used to implement proprietary test solutions and are in all cases very expensive (e.g. more than 2 millions euros for a GSM test system).  All the important experience in telecom testing products has however forced organisations such as industrial fora (ATM forum, Bluetooth SIG, etc) or standards organisations (i.e. ETSI, 3GPP) to work on optimised test methodologies and also process optimisation approaches to cope with heavy workloads over the past years to build the single market. Positive outcomes can then be identified as major EU strengths: strong testing culture and solid experience in test suites and test tool development. The GO4IT project will provide a generic low cost test environment and associated test services, together with free of charge executable test suites, targeting IPv6 focused protocol testing. The Go4IT project will permit to capitalize on large European investments made in infrastructures by giving the tools to all user communities to test IPv6 protocol based solutions thus increasing their trust and confidence in new generation infrastructures. One of the main objectives of Go4IT is to foster the community engagement in adopting a test and validation approach. Adapted service activities, supported by an open community web portal and an appropriate networking with other IPv6 and test related initiatives will further enlarge this user community. The Go4IT project will mobilise the key necessary resources for successfully achieving the objectives of the project in particular with universities and academics partners, industrial partners, test houses and Standardisation body.",0,0
562,221253,Yes,Vaccines and Infectious Diseases in the Ageing PopuLation,"Today’s major challenge is to improve efficacy of vaccines to protect the growing ageing population against infectious diseases (ID). The VITAL project aims to address this challenge by assessing the ID burden and mechanisms of immunosenescence to provide evidence-based knowledge on vaccination strategies to establish healthy ageing. Links with existing projects containing data sources combined with novel data acquired through our extensive network of dataregistries across Europe will result in a database of epidemiology, risk factors and burden of disease of both vaccine-preventable (VP) and potential vaccine-preventable ID. Crucial knowledge on factors that hamper immune responsiveness and in-depth analyses of immune compartments involved in inducing effective immune responses to different vaccines in the ageing host will be gathered. We will identify novel predictive, potentially universal immune profiles of vaccine responses using novel technologies, unique experimental models and (infection) cohorts of elderly subjects in which (bio)markers of frailty have already been identified. Novel strategies to address the problem of immunosenescence will be tested, in particular whether vaccination of middle-aged individuals can maintain proper memory immune responses in the elderly, to improve memory immunity before reaching old age. Using data on epidemiology of VPID and immune responsiveness, novel agent-based models will be developed to build a user-friendly tool to be used by health care professionals for optimal implementation of vaccination strategies for older people and to develop dissemination protocols for the obtained knowledge for the health care field. Finally, we will deliver a framework that forms the basis for designing, implementing and regularly updating vaccination schemes for the ageing population. Thereby, VITAL will initiate an important impetus to a more targeted immunization program for the elderly in Europe that will enhance healthy aging.",1,1
481,93156,No,Neuronal circuitry and plasticity of the spinal cord using in-vivo electrophysiology in transgenic mice,"The development of transgenic mice affecting development of spinal cord circuitry or mimicking hereditary neurological motor disorders has necessitated the development of in-vivo adult mouse preparations for electrophysiology to bridge molecular biology with the pathophysiology of phenotypes. The first goal is the development and refinement of a “mouse in-vivo spinal cord preparation” for intracellular recordings and analysis of spinal circuitry in “acute experiments” and a preparation for chronic recording of EMG and kinematics. These will be used to identify specific patterns of inputs to motoneurones in the mouse including the Ia monosynaptic EPSP, presynaptic inhibition, reciprocal inhibition, recurrent inhibition, propioceptive and exteroceptive polysynaptic inputs as well as the intrinsic properties of motoneurones. The data will not only characterise synaptic connectively in the mouse which can be compared to other species but will serve as control data for the rest of the project. The second goal is the use of the preparations to study transgenic mice with specific manipulations affecting the development of spinal neuronal circuitry. 2 mice mutants developed by Thomas Jessell (New York) and Silvia Arber (Basel) will be used. In the Er81 mutant mouse lack of a transcription factor causes Ia propioceptive afferents to terminate prematurely in the intermediate spinal cord. The second mutant model lacks the presynaptic GABAergic terminals on Ia afferent inputs to motoneurones. The researcher will investigate the plasticity occurring as a consequence. The third goal is to use the preparations to study transgenic mice with genetic mutations similar to those underlying neurological disorders in humans. For this the researcher will investigate plasticity in mice with a mutation affecting the glycine receptor, mimicking hyperekplexia in humans. SOD-1 mutants, models of ALS will also be used to investigate excitability changes at central part of motoneurone",1,0
515,83201,Yes,CD8+ T regs in allergen tolerance,"Allergic diseases result from an unbalanced response of the specific immune system, generating allergen-specific IgE antibodies, which mediate various clinical symptoms, such as immediate type hypersensitivity. The disease severity correlates with the activity of CD4\ T cells.  The existence of allergen-specific CD4\ Th2 cells, however, is not sufficient for allergy pathogenesis, since these cells are also found in healthy individuals. In contrast, allergen specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) occur at higher frequency than their effector counterparts in healthy individuals and are capable of suppressing proliferation and cytokine expression of Th1 and Th2 cells.  Tregs are defined on the basis of their function, in contrast to Th1 or Th2 cells, which are characterized by their gene products. The exact definition of the Tregs phenotype is therefore often difficult. Recent evidence revealed that also CD8\ Tregs contribute to peripheral tolerance.  However the contribution of these cells in allergic disease is unclear. We have preliminary evidence showing that CD8\ T cells play an important role in the allergen-specific responses. Aim of the proposal is to analyze the contribution of allergen-specific CD8\ T cells to the tolerance against allergens in healthy and allergic individuals.  Therefore the impact of allergen-specific, effector versus regulatory CD8\ T cells in allergen-driven immune reactions will be investigated along with their crosstalk to CD4 subsets and the antigen presenting cells.  We anticipate an advanced understanding of the cellular players in tolerance and pathogenesis of allergy and in turn new approaches in anti-allergic therapy.",1,1
154,34298,Yes,Common access to immunogenetics data: the integrated immunogenetics database,"The ImMunoGeneTics database, IMGT, is an integrated specialised database containing nucleotide sequence information of genes important in the function of the immune system. It collects and annotates sequences belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily which are involved in immune recognition, these are the Immunoglobulins (Ig), the T cell antigen receptors (TcR) (LIGM-DB) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). In humans, the latter are referred to as the Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) system (HLA-DB). Collection and analysis of such sequences is important for the understanding of disorders of the immune system such as infectious diseases, autoimmunity, allergy or tumour development, and for the development of antibody engineering, transplantation and immunotherapy.  IMGT works in close collaboration with the EMBL database and uses sequence information from the EMBL database for expert annotation. As the EMBL database is a generalist database, it collects sequences of all types from all species, there are insufficient resources for specialised information to be added. In IMGT however such information is added in a consistent and standardised way by expert annotators. This annotation procedure includes verification of the sequence data by homology studies using multiple sequence alignment tools, and also labelling of the sequence, which cannot be carried out at the generalist databanks. By updating the information held at the generalist databases from the specialist databases, the quality of the information will improve. This project requests support for the European partners involved in the expansion phase of the IMGT database. LIGM (France): project coordinator, responsible for the IMGT database design and structure, software development for sequence annotation and multiple alignments, annotation of TcR and Ig sequences, and integration of genetic mapping data in IMGT. EMBL-EBI (UK): IMGT database integration, interfacing with the EMBL database, database development and distribution, network interfacing and protein specific annotations for IMGT- TREMBL. ICRF (UK) and BPRC (The Netherlands) collection and annotation of HLA sequences and other MHC encoded genes, generation of alignment tables, and database development. IFG (Germany): software development for multiple sequence alignments and fast sequence searching, development of alignment tables, annotation of Ig sequences. EUROGENTEC (Belgium): constitution of an oligonucleotide primer database, application tools for fundamental, pharmaceutical and clinical purposes. The aims at the end of the 3 year project are to set up efficient IMGT sequence submission tools at EMBL-EBI, so that the authors are able to provide annotations themselves, to establish a permanent structure at LIGM and EMBL-EBI for the quality control, data distribution, and further IMGT development, to establish freely available common data access to all immunogenetics data and to provide a graphical user friendly data access. Europe has taken a lead in the development of an integrated database which is unique in the world. The data distribution are at the forefronts of technology. By management of the enormous complexity of the immunogenetics data, IMGT will be of immense value for Biology, Biotechnology, Medicine as well as for the European Pharmaceutical Industry, and will considerably help to strenghten Europe's role in these areas.",1,1
915,219736,No,"Re-inventing Paint – A Pioneering, Dry Paint Film for Radio Frequency Identification applications","With WaveShield we aim to re-invent paint for RFID applications. Our goal is to commercialize a dry, non-toxic, 100% effective RFID shielding solution with enhanced environmental and applications aspects, aiming to replace the conventional shielding liquid paints. Conductive liquid paints are the most used solution for RFID shielding. They present a competitive quality/price ratio but the application process is complicated (9-step process) and time consuming (three to five days). Durability (dripping, cracking) and thickness control are also a challenge as they often generate shielding ineffectiveness (RFID signals go through holes or too thin layer of paint). Moreover, their VOCs content, along with the odor and dust emission during application, can have serious adverse health effects on workers and significant environmental impact. Thus, the RFID technology market is in need of a more effective, cleaner, enhanced alternative solution to prevent identification errors, simplify the application procedure and reduce the environmental impact. WaveShield technology is a pioneering, VOC-free, 100% effective shielding, ready-to-use dry paint film with an embedded and mastered shielding function. It has high durability and the application procedure is a clean, simplified 3-step process, applied in only one day, without the need to remove or cover items or evacuate the space to be coated. We create a cost-efficient coating technology at a competitive price (€30/m2) that can be applied by coating professionals through standard application techniques. CORSO MAGENTA is a pioneering start-up SME, expert in alternative coating products since its foundation in 2007. Since then, we have spent €2.6M on R&D to find an innovative solution and face those challenges.  Through this project, we aim to reach revenues of about €17 million after the fifth year of commercialization and create at least 35 new job positions. With a Phase 2 investment of €1.49M, this would imply a ROI of 4.55.",0,0
754,128,No,"CONTROL OF EUTYPIOSE : EARLY DETECTION, PREVENTION AND STUDY OF HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIP WITH A VIEW TO DEFINING A METHOD OF CURATIVE CONTROL","Eutypiose is a grapevine die back disease which has spread through out the European vineyard over the last decade.  The causal agent is Eutypa lata (ascomycetum) and seriousness of the disease has been under-estimated since a long incubation period preceed the destruction of the plant (3 to 8 years) and symptoms expression during vegetation, the only available assessment of plant health is dependant on climatic conditions of the bud-burst period.  At the moment no curative method has been developed and only prophylactic and preventive control exist.    The project will have as main objectives to (1) develop methods of prophylactic and preventive control to limit spread of the disease; (2) create tool(s) for early detection; (3) improve or create new methods for controling disease including curative one.  Eutypiose is a fungal disease causing die back of grapevine which has spread throughout European vineyards over the last decade. The causal agent is Eutypa lata (ascomycetum) and the only expression of symptons occurs during the bud burst period but these are revealed only if climatic conditions are favourable. No cure exists at present, although preventive control and prophylactic measures are available. Research is underway to: develop methods of prophylactic and preventive control to limit spread of the disease; create tools for early detection; and improve or create new methods for controlling the disease including curative ones.  An observation network to assess the evolution, scale and importance of the disease has been set up covering wine growing areas in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. First results suggest that expression of symptons following bud burst is generally less important in other countries than in France. Experiments conducted on control methods such as cutting down vine stocks and fungicide sprays have demonstrated low efficacy. Research on early detection has been initiated by grafting fungal eutypine toxin on a carrier protein. Antibodies have been obtained but their titres were low. In work on the host parasite relationship, Eutypa lata strains have been selected, one aggressive and the other not. The kinetics of degradation of wood has been studied and related enzymes determined. First results on receptivity to fungal spores, following wood pruning, suggest no difference between vine stocks and that later pruning reduces infectivity. Specific studies have commenced with eutypin toxin and cytological studies have indicated an alteration of chloropasts in diseased plants. The experiments will include : (1) dissemination of technology and setting up an observation network to assess the scale of the disease (importance and evolution); (2) agronomic experiments to study the modes of expression of symptoms during vegetation (under different climatic conditions) and to define new control; (3) development and dissemination of existing control methods among wine growers; (4) development of an early diagnostic test; (5) and (6) studies on host-parasite relationship (attack and propagation of the fungus in wood) and on Eutypine (toxin synthetized by the fungus).",0,0
759,81339,No,Young labour Migrants in Chinese Cities: A demonstration-intervention project to address barriers to health care and promote their sexual and reproductive health,"The economic boom in P.R. China provoked a huge demand in manpower, mostly in the East-Southern part of the country. In 2000, the Government of China reformed the household registration system to encourage labour mobility, resulting in large-scale migration of the rural population. The number of internal migrants is currently estimated at 140 million. Migrants are younger than resident populations and lower educated. Former studies demonstrated poorer health indicators in migrants with higher rates of induced abortion, lower rates of contraceptive use, and a higher maternal mortality rate. In some cities, the maternal mortality rates among migrants are higher than in the rural areas of China.  The proposed research will study determinants of access of young migrants to care and to health information. Comparisons with resident young workers will permit to assess risks attributed to the migrant status. The research will further focus on how the public and private services, including existing health facilities in larger factories, address the health needs of young migrant workers. In a second step, strategies to improve health service delivery and information to the migrants will be developed through interactive discussions between beneficiaries and public or private stakeholders, using the workplace as an entry point. Those strategies will take into account specific characteristics of the labour migrants such as working schedule, gender, ethnic and equity issues. The third step consists in implementation of these strategies through local interventions aiming at improve the access of young migrants to reproductive health services.  Those projects will mobilise the working unit, the health services and the target population. The final step consists in the evaluation of the interventions, the discussion of results with the different actors, the definition of recommendations to optimise service delivery to the target group and the dissemination of results.",1,0
751,13732,No,BIOCHEMICAL PHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE CONTROL OPTIMIZATION OF ANIMAL CELL CULTURES IN BIOREACTORS,"THE OBJECTIVE IS ESSENTIALLY TECHNOLOGICAL, AND EXPECTED RESULTS ARE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF MASS ANIMAL CELLS CULTURE.  A basic understanding of cell physiology and nutritional requirements of animal cell cultures has been acquired. Measurements of the activity of secreted enzymes, such as beta-glucuronidase and lactate dehydrogenase, gave good estimates of the cell viability and concentration. The effects of different types of physical stresses on cell behaviour were tested and it was found that cells can withstand substantial shear forces, provided a critical level is not exceeded. Some particular ultrasounds increased protein secretion. Detailed kinetics studies were performed in batch and continuous cultures to interrelate the way in which the cells grew, died and secreted products to the concentration of key medium components (nutrients, serum, metabolites). Mathematical models with an excellent simulation capacity were established. In several perfusion bioreactors (hollow fibers, spin filter and packed static bed) continuous cell cultures were maintained for long periods with cell concentrations 100 times higher than those in batch cultures. Aeration by bubble and bubble free systems was optimised at different scales of operation.

923,78617,No,Registration of Biological Control Agents,"Biological control agents (BCAs) are sustainable and environmentally safe tools to manage pest insects, nematodes, weeds and diseases in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. However, registration procedures have been established for micro-organisms, semiochemicals and botanicals, which prevent their market introduction. Registration largely follows rules developed for synthetic pesticides, thus many possibly irrelevant investigations are requested. Costly risk assessment studies and long term evaluation of dossiers keep these products off the market. The time frame for the EU evaluation of dossiers according to Directive 91/414/EEC is > 70 months compared with ca. 23 months for the same products in the USA. Due to their nature and specificity of action, BCAs should not be treated like synthetic chemicals and therefore need a different approach for risk assessment and regulation. The objective of the Action REBECA is to accelerate the regulation process for BCAs and make it more cost-effective without compromises to the level of safety. The Action will review current legislation, guidelines and guidance documents at Member State and EU level and compare them with legislation in countries where the market introduction of BCAs was more successful. Potential risks of BCAs will be reviewed and proposals are prepared on how regulation of BCAs can be balanced according to their potential hazards. Costs and benefits related to different levels of regulation will be reviewed and trade-offs evaluated. Alternative regulation strategies will be developed for low risk products. The action will bring together stakeholders from industry, science, regulation authorities, policy and environment to form a network within Europe bringing together the expertise and critical mass necessary to improve regulation procedures for BCAs.

Within this general agenda, the COMED project focuses on one broad category of healthcare technologies (medical devices) for exemplary, empirical purposes to: (i) improve economic evaluation methods for medical devices in the context of the HTA framework by increasing their methodological quality and integrating data from different data sources; (ii) investigate health system performance through analysis of variation in costs and outcomes across different geographical areas and (iii)strengthen the use of economic evaluation of medical devices in policy making. COMED’s ambition is to develop scientifically rigorous recommendations on what, when and how real world evidence sources can and should be used for assessment of medical devices.  COMED’s aim is to develop new methods for assessing patient reported outcomes for mHealth technologies. COMED will provide a comprehensive answer on the main drivers of clinical practice variations across Europe by differentiating between warranted and unwarranted causes of disparities.

259,37180,No,Valve-regulated battery with improved separators avoiding electrolyte stratification and charge controller for low-cost photovoltaic and wind installations,"PROJECT OBJECTIVES   The objective of this project is the development of improved and low cost PV/wind systems, to be used mainly in special locations like isolated areas, farmhouses, etc, in which it is more advantageous to install such systems than to be connected to the main network what would be too costly in most cases.  These systems are composed of three main subsystems : Solar or wind turbine generators, batteries for storing generated energy, and charge controller/conditioner. Among these systems, the most important for determing the performance and life are the batteries and the charge regulator. The specific objective of the project is to improve the performance of both components, with special incidence in the battery.   TECHNICAL APPROACH   The specific problem, that at the battery level limits the performance and especially the system life, is the progressive development of acid stratification (different acid densities from the bottom to the top) in the battery. This is mainly due to the fact that in solar/wind applications, due to their random nature, a complete recharge of the batteries cannot be always assured. The development of electrolyte stratification will lead to the following problems : Lower energy available from the battery, high sulphation of the plates, and, especially, high corrosion. The result is a severe limitation of the attainable life.   In this project, the intention is to overcome this problem developing a new separator material, that will decrease, or even eliminate, the acid stratification in the battery. To achieve this, the structure of the glass mat separator will be modified by the inclusion of especial filling materials. Concerning charge regulator the main feature will be the degree of overcharge, depth of discharge) along the previous two weeks, for optmizing the using conditions and life.   EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION   After completion of the project, the life of these systems is expected to be improved from the actual value (around 400 cycles), to more than 800 deep discharge cycles. This marked increase will lead to a significant decrease of the cost of these systems, on a life basis, making them more competitive and attractive to the user. If successful, the new battery with the new separator could be also applied to other uses that imply heavy and repetitive cycling, like light motive power applications. The financial involvement of several industrial partners a big company like TUDOR and small and specialized ones like BERNARD DUMAS and ATERSA, is an indication of their interest in the exploitation of the results.",0,0

686,227542,Yes,DNA-guided self-organized active materials,"Programming the autonomous and multiscale structuring of shapeless synthetic soft matter is unknown and conceptually challenging. In stark contrast, a living embryo is highly ordered at all levels – from cells to the entire organism. The ordering is a multistep process, starting from the patterning of biomolecules (morphogens) which later instruct autonomous shape transformations (morphogenesis). Inspired by these natural physicochemical processes, we aim at the preparation of a first-ever synthetic biocompatible material which can be self-organized in a programmable and autonomous manner. The programming will be achieved by an out-of-equilibrium DNA-based chemical network which predictably generates single-stranded DNA morphogens. Combined with diffusion, the concentrations of the morphogen can be patterned with a unique spatiotemporal precision, including travelling waves and stable fronts, which were pioneered by the host group. The autonomy of morphological structuring will be accomplished by linking the mechanical activity of active gels, composed of DNA-kinesins and microtubules, to the presence of the DNA morphogen. Latter will act as a cross-linker creating the clusters of kinesins and thus guiding the self-organization of the soft material by the collective action of nanoscale kinesin motor proteins which exert force on microtubules. Apart from the preparation of a first biocompatible man-made morphogenetic material, we will learn how the self-organization of active gels is dependent on morphogens’ patterns. This knowledge is indispensable for the advanced programming of the precise macroscale shapes at the molecular level of chemical networks, which are diverse and modular. With further developments, our methodology could lead to so far elusive self-fabricated, force-exerting synthetic soft matter with the potential of integration in soft robotics and biological environments.",0,1
236,199373,No,Revamping trains with the most advanced broadband communication system,"In the railway industry, the average age of active rolling stock fleet worldwide is over 25 years. There are more than 300,000 passenger coaches in the world and over 84,000 in Europe (considering train, metro and light rail vehicles). In addition, train operators need to improve the quality of their services in order to satisfy the increasingly exigent standards and the demands from passengers for advanced travel information and comfort (location, train connections, time to destination, temperature, humidity, etc). These rising requirements are driving to the adoption of advanced Passenger Information Systems (PIS) which require appropriate bandwidth and reliability. Most of current coaches do not have the necessary networking infrastructure to provide modern PIS. On the other hand, current alternatives present significant drawbacks: Ethernet is a time consuming and expensive alternative to install and operate, while Wi-fi is not ready for its deployment due to its technical limitations (low reliability and insufficient bandwidth). NET4TRAIN is a novel communication networking solution for the railway industry that supports advanced PIS and on-board diagnosis specially designed for the revamping of aged trains. We offer a broadband network over existing cabling using Powerline communications and thus avoiding the installation of new cables. Therefore, our solution dramatically reduces costs and installation times compared to existing alternatives. Phase 1 execution will allow us to deepen into the critical data of each target market in order to establish the right entrance strategy, thereby defining our detailed commercialization plan.

The aim of this Coordination Action (CA) is to support a research program on tick-borne diseases jointly executed by a consortium of 45 institutions in 30 different countries. The CA will focus on tick-host-pathogen interactions to identify concrete means of control that reduce the prevalence of TBD in (sub)tropical countries. The project will generate a clu ster of integrated databases for ticks, hosts and pathogens, crucial for correct identification of ticks and precise differential diagnosis of pathogens. The CA will function as a forum to discuss, evaluate and recommend changes regarding biosystematics and molecular phylogeny of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. Integrated molecular diagnostic test kits will be distributed to provide research tools for comparative epidemiological studies on tick-borne pathogens. Prevalence data on ticks and tick-borne pa thogens will be linked to remotely sensed eco-climatic data to create predictive maps for geographical distribution of tropical ticks and TBD in the target regions. Genomics and proteomics data for ticks and tick-borne pathogens will be exploited to desi gn novel integrated vaccine strategies targeting ticks and pathogens to reduce dependency on chemical tick control. The CA wil act as a focal point for setting up consortia on novel genomics and sequencing projects particularly for ticks. Differential ge ne expression studies will be facilitated using sequences from ticks, hosts and pathogens to provide insight into the three-way interactions of genes within the tick-host-pathogen triangle. All information generated by the CA project will be disseminate d through ICTTD seminars, special publications and through printed and electronic versions of a Newsletter on ticks and tick-borne diseases of livestock in the (sub)tropics.",1,0
828,104880,No,DEvelopment platform for Safe and Efficient dRiVE,"According to a recent forecast published by ABI Research , a fast growth of the market of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) is foreseen in the next five years. For example, in 2016 the overall annual market for Lane Departure Warning systems is expected to reach 22 million units/year (corresponding to 14,3 billion dollars). This market growth will be possible only through the reduction of costs of components as well as the seamless integration of different functions in the same architecture. Since the market will include also low volume vehicles, there will be also a strong need to reduce development costs. Electric vehicles will be an additional catalyst for the ADAS market. The absence of engine noise requires the introduction of new means to protect vulnerable road users from these vehicles. On the other hand, electric vehicles can easily support (semi)automatic functions (such as parking manoeuvres and Stop&Go). To manage the expected increase of function complexity together with the required reduction of costs (fixed and variable) DESERVE will design and build an ARTEMIS Tool Platform based on the standardisation of the interfaces, software (SW) reuse, development of common non-competitive SW modules,  and easy and safety-compliant integration of  standardised hardware (HW) or SW from different suppliers. With innovative design space exploration (DSE) methods system design costs can be reduced by more than 15%. Hence, DESERVE will build an innovation ecosystem for European leadership in ADAS embedded systems, based on the automotive R&D actors, with possible applications in other industrial domains. Since the purpose of ADAS functions is also to support the driver, an advanced human-centred design strategy will be integrated in the Tool Platform. Therefore, the developed applications will provide natural and friendly  support to the driver, with proper levels of overall functional safety also during complex or emergency manoeuvres. - - - Version approved by the JU on 14/07/2015",0,0

767,206971,No,Protection of Redox Catalysts for Cathodic Processes in Redox Matrices.,"Biological or molecular catalysts built from Earth-abundant elements are envisioned as economically viable alternatives to the scarce noble metals that are currently used in renewable energy conversion. However, their fragility and O2 sensitivity have been obstacles to their adoption in industry. We have recently proposed O2 quenching matrices for protecting intrinsically O2-sensitive catalysts for use in anodic (oxidative) processes. We have demonstrated that even hydrogenases, the highly sensitive metalloenzymes that oxidize H2, can be used under the harsh conditions encountered in operating fuel cells. However, attempts to reverse the concept for the protection of cathodic (reductive) processes, such as H2 evolution, have been unsuccessful so far. In this case, the electrode generates the reducing agents in the form of electrons, which are needed for both H2 generation and reductive O2 quenching. The competition between the two reactions results in insufficient protection from O2 and deactivation of the catalyst. The objective is to design an alternative electron pathway that relies on H2 as a charge carrier to efficiently shuttle the reductive force to the matrix boundaries and quench the incoming O2. We will develop novel electron mediators with dual functionalities to enable the reversible H2/H\ interconversion and to achieve the complete reduction of O2 to water. We will focus on organic systems, as well as metal complexes based on Earth-abundant elements with tunable ligand spheres, to adjust their redox potentials for the desired direction of the electron flow and toward fast O2 reduction kinetics. The synthetic efforts will be supported by electrochemical modelling to predict the required properties of the redox matrix for efficient protection. After establishing the protection principle, we will demonstrate its practical use for implementing sensitive bio-catalysts for electrochemical H2 evolution under conditions relevant to energy conversion processes.",0,0

The relationship between mental and physical disorders is complex and not clearly understood. Although it is well reported that MC have a high impact in the lifespan and mortality of people with psychiatric disorders. Recent studies support the hypothesis that there may be shared aetiological factors, including  environmental and genetic factors, between psychiatric disorders and MC. In a cross-sectional study (PISMA-ep) of a representative sample of the Andalusian population, 4,500 individuals donated a biological sample for genetic studies. Diagnosis of psychiatric disorders was ascertained using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). In addition to psychological, social and sociodemographic information, a wealth of detailed data on chronic, comorbid MC were collected using a validated checklist. OBJECTIVES: 1) examine the prevalence and characteristics of MC in individuals with major psychiatric disorders and compare them with psychiatrically healthy controls; 2) DNA extraction and genotyping of candidate genes/polymorphisms 3) explore genetic and environmental factors in comorbid mental and physical diseases. METHODS: we will use available statistical packages to determine the frequency of comorbid MC in psychiatric disorders, stratifying by social and environmental risk factors. We will perfom DNA extraction and genotyping of candidate genes in the total sample. EXPECTED RESULTS: we should expect to find higher prevalence of MC in people with psychiatric disorders, as well as genetic and environmental increased risk in individuals with a history of comorbid MC in psychiatric disorders.",1,1

Europe, with 3 of its countries (France, Germany and The Netherlands) as three of the top four seed exporters in the world includes nearly 7,200 seed companies and more than 50,000 employees. Production of high quality seeds can increase crop yield by 15-20%. Seed moisture content needs to be controlled to ensure high germination rates, thus high quality seeds. An optimum drying process with control of air’s relative humidity and temperature is needed to ensure harvested seed is at safe moisture content before storage or other purposes. Existing drying and cooling methods for seeds lack of control of these parameters, are not energy efficient and require high investment from farmers. Moreover, seed drying is one of the most energy consuming processes on farms, consuming as much energy as all field works together. With an efficient seed drying process, savings for farmers could be more than 50%. DryCoolerSeeds is able to dry and cool the seeds in a continuous monitored process with adaptation to climate variations, saving energy (99% of energy saved), time (2.5 less time needed than traditional dryers), ensuring the correct moisture content and temperature of seeds, resulting therefore in high quality seeds. Marcold’s technology is a step further in automation, simplification and costs savings (>60% compared to mix flow drying) being able to incorporate two different functions (drying and cooling) in a single machine surpassing the competition in the current market. The aim of the project is to build and demonstrate in real end user’s facilities our DryCoolerSeeds prototype adjusting the working parameters for effective conservation of seeds while ensuring a successful commercialization of the technology in Europe and Latin America that will drive Marcold into an exponential growth.",0,0
53,79886,Yes,Establishment of high-throughput monoclonal antibody production and hybridoma bank,"Over the last 20 years, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against several thousand proteins have become commercially available. When considering the number of proteins predicted in the human and other genomes, this number is still far from meeting the current demand to perform comprehensive proteome analyses of biological systems and it therefore represents a bottleneck to further development of proteome research. In view of general needs in the area of biomedical research, a high throughput development and production of mAbs is considered one of the most promising approaches to build up a research and biotechnology unit.  This was a strong argument for the establishment of the Centre for Monoclonal Antibody Production at the University of Rijeka (CAPRI). Given the already made investment into infrastructure and basic equipment by the University, the proposed SSA project will be used for upgrading the capabilities of CAPRI in order to enable it to run a high-throughput production of mAbs and increasing its networking activity with potential mAbs users - research teams from universities and public research institutes, but also from the private sector. By having a large collection of specific mAbs, CAPRI can be a driving force for the development of small enterprises.  The immediate goal of the project is to enable the CAPRI staff to generate mAbs against all proteins of several relevant human viruses, starting from mAbs against the entire proteome of the Variccela Zoster Virus (VZV). By making these mAbs available to research groups and companies from Croatia and from the region, the project will not only be beneficial for upgrading the scientific competence of Croatian bioscience, but it should also contribute to strengthening the scientific and technological cooperation within the region and improving its competitiveness for participating in the EU Framework Programmes (especially in the thematic priority 'Life Sciences, Genomics and Biotechnology for Health').",0,1

Cultural landscapes, however, are undergoing rapid and fundamental transformations across Europe, mainly as a result of an on-going polarization of land use, with abandonment and rural exodus on the one hand, and intensification and (peri-) urbanisation on the other. So far, substantial challenges have inhibited the design of effective responses to safeguard cultural landscape values. The proposed HERCULES project strives for the empowerment of public and private actors to protect, manage, and plan for sustainable landscapes of significant cultural, historical, and archaeological value at local, national, and pan-European scales. By applying and developing innovative technologies and tools for assessing and mapping cultural landscapes, the project will (a) synthesise existing knowledge on drivers, patterns, and outcomes of persistence and change in Europe’s cultural landscapes; (b) perform targeted case studies to develop in-depth insights on dynamics and values of cultural landscapes; (c) develop a typology of cultural landscapes and scale-up case study insights using observations and landscape modelling; (d) develop visions for re-coupling social and ecological components in cultural landscapes and translate them into policy and management options; and (e) design and implement a community-based Knowledge Hub for Good Landscape Practice and demonstrate it with land users, agencies, SMEs, and citizen associations.

25,101734,Yes,Advanced multifunctional zirconia ceramics for long-lasting implants,"The aim of LONGLIFE is to develop new multi-functional zirconia oral and spine (lumbar inter-vertebral disc) implants, with a perfect reliability and a lifetime longer than 60 years. Such an ambitious goal, motivated by the risks and costs associated to revision surgery, will only be reachable by an improvement of the Low Temperature Degradation (LTD) resistance of zirconia and by an enhancement of the osseointegration capabilities of the implants in contact with bone. As zirconia-based ceramics are the only oxides able to couple high stress resistance and fracture toughness thanks to transformation toughening, a strong effort will be given to the improvement of their stability in the presence of water, without decreasing their toughness and strength. Osseointegration will be improved by the chemical and topographical modification of the surface. We aim at producing zirconia surfaces able to decrease the risk of bacterial adhesion and improve bone apposition, for better clinical success. Given the specific nature of ceramics, especially versus the risk of brittle failure, we aim at developing new ceramic-oriented designs for the implants, and not just ‘copy and paste’ from metal implants as it is generally done at present. This ‘implants by design’ approach will ensure a better, long-lasting success of oral and spine implants. At last, the LONGLIFE consortium will develop acceleration tests which will be able to reproduce more effectively the different degradation mechanisms and their interplay in a multi-physics approach, in order to ensure an implant reliability and lifetime superior to current implants’.",0,1

Accidents and hazards may arise due to technical defects in control and sensor systems, such as in equip-ment, vehicles and household appliances. Thus, unsafe electric and/or electronics represent an underestimated risk of life-threats for people. The worst case is, that electric or electronic product failures cause injuries or even deaths. Thus and improved safety analysis in system design is strongly required to guarantee the quality and safety of products – especially in transport.    In the automotive supply industry, further waves of consolidation are connected to marked growth. This is partly due to a progressive reduction of vertical integration on the part of the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), on the other hand, there is an increasing reduction in the depth of development and a transfer of development services to specialized and modular system suppliers.

This project will be developed in collaboration with three top experimental groups at different research institutions, and will be carried out by Dr. Franco Bonafé under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Angel Rubio, Director of the Theory Department of MPSD.  The main goal of the project is to demonstrate that the spatial and temporal resolution of different spectroscopies can be improved by utilizing the ultra-strong confinement of structured light down to the nanoscale. To this purpose, we will optimize the shape and arrangement of plasmonic nanostructures using machine learning algorithms, combining real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations coupled fully self-consistently to Maxwell's equations. The work is divided into three main parts with clear interdependent tasks and goals, namely: 1) geometry optimization of plasmonic nanostructures to enhance the confinement of light, and its application in photoelectron emission; 2) development of a frequency-domain linear-response technique to increase the resolution of tip-enhanced Raman spectra of molecular vibrations in nanocavities; and 3) study of near-field structured light for attosecond photoelectron spectra of 2D materials. Our predictions will be experimentally tested by our network of experimental groups.  Overall, the aim of the project is to push the limits of state-of-the-art molecular spectroscopy techniques by ab initio computer simulations, increasing our ability to understand the properties of matter both at the scales of molecular vibrations and of attosecond electron dynamics in 2D materials. The researcher will clearly benefit from gaining training in non-equilibrium ab initio methods and from the world-wide top level network of experimental collaborators, that will bring him to a new stage in his career towards becoming an independent group leader in theoretical spectroscopy.",0,0
462,227615,No,Dissecting the protection mechanism of new generation vaccines by synchronizing systems biology with in vivo imaging,"Despite successful reduction of the burden of many infectious diseases by vaccination and the strong improvement of vaccine safety, there is a strong need to improve existing vaccines and to develop new affordable vaccines with greater efficacy. Particle-based vaccines are one of the recent advances, with potentially a promising impact on global public health. Besides being investigated for their protective potential, the knowledge about their mechanism of protection is still scarce. VacTrack is designed to investigate this by innovatively combining state of the art in vivo imaging with global transcriptome analyses. I aim to dissect the route vaccines acquire inside the host along with the spatio-temporal changes in gene expression following vaccine exposure to the host, by utilizing pneumococcal antigens grafted to outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as model formulations in imaging-assisted in vivo mouse vaccination and challenge infection models. VacTrack is expected to generate insights about novel pathways triggered in host following vaccination which will be further validated by an ex vivo approach via stimulation of murine and human whole blood. By exploiting systems biology, high resolution in vivo imaging and immunological approaches VacTrack will provide a blue print for the approach to study mechanism of protection of vaccines in general. Comprehension of correlates of protection by combining in vivo and ex vivo analyses will  1) help devise new pneumococcal vaccines, 2) improve existing vaccine formulations, 3) transform the direction of vaccine research by allowing targeting of specific novel pathways identified via VacTrack. Taken together, this proposal holds great potential in advancing the vaccine research to devise new and better vaccines to save and improve human lives on a global level.",1,0
538,3894,Yes,COORDINATION RESEARCH ON FELINE AIDS,"The initial goal of the Concerted Action was to evaluate FIV as a model for HIV and AIDS. Initially several aspects of FIV biology were investigated. As a result the Concerted Action began to focus on vaccinerelated issues. The aim in this area was to define the mechanisms by which vaccines produced protective immunity. These studies should suggest strategies for the development of vaccines against HIV. Research focuses on feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) as a model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with special emphasis on using the model to develop vaccines and test antiviral drugs. In fact an effective vaccine against FIV already exists, but because it is derived from infectious material, the same approach can probably not be applied to humans. The participants' aim is to clone and express whole or partial viral proteins, with a view to incorporating these into vaccines. The multicentre approach is particularly useful here, as there appear to be several different viruses and it is important to ensure that as many viruses as possible are available to challenge vaccinated cats. Another collaborative venture involves developing assays to detect FIV infection in living cats and in the test tube, and to monitor the animals' immune response to the virus. The work has already produced a virus neutralisation test.  Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has proved to be an analogue of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a useful model for developing vaccines against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In cats protection has been achieved by Yamamoto et al using chemically inactivated virus or virus infected cells. While this approach demonstrates the important point that vaccination is feasible, the use of antigen derived from infectious material is probably not feasible for HIV vaccine development.  The approach taken by participating laboratories in the concerted action has been to work towards the use of recombinant proteins of the virus, particularly the products of the env gene, as immunogens in vaccines. Several prototype FIV strains have been molecularly cloned and proteins have been expressed in a number of different systems. Some of these are presently being tested in vaccine trials. A database of sequences of the env gene of many European isolates has been established and virus neutralization patterns between strains have been investigated. Hence it will be possible to choose genetically and antigenetically and similar and distinct strains of FIV for use as challenge viruses in protection trials.  There has been considerable collaboration in the development of assays to detect FIV infection in vivo and in vitro, and to monitor the serological responses to the virus. Monoclonal antibodies have been produced to the major structural proteins of the virus and are available for use by all participating groups.  A major conclusion of the work of the collaborating centres was that FIV is an excellent model for studying various aspects of lentiviral biology that the virus shares with HIV. Of particular interest was the pathogenesis of infection and the dynamics of viral growth and the resulting immune response in infected individuals. The differences that were found between the biology of FIV and HIV emphasize the common pathways by which the 2 viruses achieve essentially identical final results in their target species. The second major conclusion was that the model was most valuable in developing strategies for vaccination. The development of a successful vaccine based on inactivated virus provided an excellent opportunity to define the determinants of protective immunity.",1,1

468,107864,No,Standard and non-standard  hyperon beta decays,"We aim to provide the first comprehensive analysis of the physics reach of the hyperon beta decays using an effective field theory setup. The project includes assessing the experimental sensitivity required in different hyperon decay observables to perform critical tests of the s->u transitions of the Standard Model, and to identify prominent observables particularly sensitive to non-standard effects. Complementarity with equivalent analyses in kaon (semi)leptonic decays will be addressed. The main goal of the project is to use hyperon beta decay observables to constrain models beyond the standard model at the TeV energy scale or, eventually, to discover effects of new physics. Determination of the form factors using chiral perturbation theory, Large Nc methods, and using results from lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations will be necessary. The outgoing phase takes place in the University of California/San Diego with Prof Aneesh Manohar, who developed the chiral and Large Nc theories employed in this proposal. The return phase takes place in the Institut für Kernphysik of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, in collaboration with Prof M. Vanderhaeghen. The return host currently counts with a network of prestigious Research Groups, Centers and Infrastructures focused on the search of physics beyond the Standard Model. The proposal aims to trigger the interest at both the experimental and theoretical levels to undertake, in the medium- and long-term, a high-precision study of the hyperon beta decays, with the subsequent increase of the determination/discovery /constraining power of these modes.",0,0
778,102908,No,Engineering Network and Interference Geometry for the Analysis and Design of Next Generation Wireless Networks,"Today, our society, industry and service sectors are increasingly becoming more dependent on information and communication technologies (ICT) in general and wireless telecommunication networks in particular. For example, fourth generation (4G) wireless networks has transformed mobile handsets into intelligent terminals for providing an easy anytime-anywhere access to all sorts of information and services in our daily lives such as location tracking, high-definition video streaming, and portfolio monitoring and management. ICT empowered with next generation wireless protocols for machine-to-machine communication is expected to decrease total greenhouse gas emissions from all industry sectors by 15%, and to advance current medical and public health practices significantly within the next decade.  Such a wide range of application areas brings together new interoperability challenges for heterogeneous network architectures and requires innovative approaches for interference mitigation to support data rates as high as 1 Gbits/sec in low mobility and 100 Mbits/sec in high mobility environments. This project will engineer network and interference geometry to derive fundamental performance bounds and to mitigate interference for next generation heterogeneous wireless and complex networks. It will combine stochastic geometry and random geometric graphs with the theory of complex networks, nonlinear optimization and advanced distribution approximation techniques to discover hidden dynamics and underlying fundamental properties peculiar to these networks. Novel, distributed, practical and provably optimal or near-optimal algorithms will be devised to manage and control heterogeneous wireless and complex communication networks, as well as safeguarding them against unexpected failures, attacks and anomalies. Project outcomes are also expected to find interdisciplinary applications beyond wireless networks to other complex networks such as Internet and social networks.",0,0
824,85334,No,Dynamic Impairment Constraint Networking for Transparent Mesh Optical Networks,"'The DICONET proposal is targeting a novel approach to optical networking providing a disruptive solution for the development of the core network of the future. It is the vision and goal of our consortium to provide ultra high speed end-to-end connectivity with quality of service and high reliability through the use of optimised protocols and routing algorithms that will complement a flexible control and management plane offering flexibility for the future network infrastructure. We plan to investigate, design, implement and test new routing and wavelength assignment algorithms considering as constraints physical impairments that arise in transparent core networks. These algorithms will be incorporated into a novel dynamic network planning tool that would consider dynamic traffic characteristics, varying physical impairment and component characteristics and a reconfigurable optical layer. The use of this novel planning tool in conjunction with proper extensions to the control plane of core optical networks that will be designed, implemented and tested by our consortium will make possible to realize the vision of transparency, while offering efficient resource utilization and strict quality of service guarantees based on certain service level agreements. The combinations of the tools, algorithms and protocols that will developed by the uniquely qualified DICONET consortium together with new technologies and architectures that will be considered as enablers for the network of the future will assist in overcoming the expected long term limitations of current core network capabilities. The DICONET scope and objectives, address dynamic cross-layer network planning and optimization while considering the development of a future transport network infrastructure which ensures fail-safe network configuration and operation.

558,74634,Yes,Intelligent intra-oral medicine delivery micro-system to treat addiction and chronic diseases,"IntelliDrug is aimed at developing an intelligent micro- and nano- system to provide an alternative approach for the treatment of addiction and chronic diseases. Chronic diseases and Drug addiction are among the most severe human problems, the latter being a major motive of crime and social instability. The continuous and endless efforts required from treating personnel and the afflicted persons further compromise the quality of life and give rise to severe compliance problems with therapy. In addition, limited effectiveness and adverse side effects are the result of the currently used medication administration methods. The proposed project IntelliDrug is aimed at obviating these problems.  The proposed innovation will be reached by developing an intra-oral micro-system, which contains a medication replacement reservoir and releases the medication in a controlled, intelligent manner according to the patient needs, in periods lasting days, weeks or months. The device will be reloaded in a simple non-invasive way. The micro-system comprises a medication release mechanism, a built-in intelligence, micro-sensors and micro-actuators, and a remote control. This project explores the application potential of micro-nano technology and investigates the integration technologies required to establish the nano to macro interface and to have 'nano' interact with the ambient. IntelliDrug deals with research and development of key technologies, such as biosensors and secure communication, low volume controlled drug handling, and the component integration into wearable systems, to manage health status.  The resulting micro-system will help afflicted persons to put an end to their personal misery, to run a life as close as possible to normal and even to turn into a productive member of our society.

131,223199,Yes,Vaccine Against Schistosomiasis for Africa. A Phase I clinical study of the SchistoShield® anti-schistosomiasis vaccine in adults in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa,"Schistosomiasis is a poverty-related neglected tropical disease, impacting one billion people in 74 countries. Science ranked a schistosomiasis-vaccine as one of the top-10 vaccines urgently needed. Chemotherapy is the preferred method for schistosomiasis control; but the effectiveness of mass-treatment programs is compromised by reinfection requiring regular re-treatment. An efficacious vaccine, with long-lasting protection against all schistosomiasis forms, would impact disease control. We request funding for the clinical development of our SchistoShield®-vaccine (Sm-p80 antigen\GLA-SE adjuvant) in Burkina Faso and Madagascar, where Schistosoma mansoni (causing intestinal/hepatic schistosomiasis) and S. haematobium (causing urinary schistosomiasis) are endemic. In baboon studies, SchistoShield® has been effective against all major schistosome species. It is the only vaccine candidate having consistently exhibited potent prophylactic, anti-fecundity, egg-induced pathology resolving, transmission-blocking and therapeutic efficacy. The objectives are to 1) transfer vaccine manufacturing technology for cGMP production to a European manufacturer; 2) assess the safety/immunogenicity of SchistoShield® in a Phase I clinical study in healthy African adults; 3) refine a schistosomiasis human challenge model to identify correlates of protection, innate and adaptive immune signatures, gene expression and the role of antibodies in the prevention/control of Schistosoma infections; and 4) foster a global consortium to advance research on schistosomiasis vaccines and address downstream access constraints in resource-poor settings. The funding requested will allow the clinical development of SchistoShield®. GMP production will be transferred to a European partner. African site research capacity will be improved and epidemiological burden data using novel diagnostic techniques will be used to advance clinical development to Phase 2 and potential future elimination project",1,1
570,222279,Yes,Challenging the KNDy Hypothesis Using CRISPR-Cas9 Genome Editing: Evaluation of the Role of Neurokinin B and Dynorphin in Kiss1 neurons in the Control of Fertility,"The function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is mastered by the hypothalamic neuronal population producing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which regulates LH and FSH secretion by the pituitary. Perturbations of fertility, e.g., in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and hypogonadism associated with metabolic disorders, are related to functional alterations in the neuronal networks controlling pulsatile GnRH secretion. Recently, a neuronal population in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), which synthesizes kisspeptins (Kp; products of the Kiss1 gene), has been identified as an essential element in the regulation of pulsatile GnRH release. This ARC Kiss1 neuronal population co-expresses the neuropeptides, neurokinin B (NKB; encoded by Tac2) and dynorphin-A (Dyn; encoded by Pdyn); the term KNDy (for Kiss1, NKB & Dyn) has been coined to name this population. Different studies have pointed out the reciprocal stimulatory and inhibitory roles of NKB and Dyn, respectively, in the control of Kp output, which seemingly play a crucial role in the control of GnRH pulse generation. However, the relevance of such NKB/Dyn interplay in the dynamic control of GnRH release in different (patho)-physiological conditions, and whether this is fully dependent on Kp signaling, has not been fully clarified. We propose here to apply for the first time somatic genome editing of Tac2, Pdyn and Kiss1 loci in KNDy neurons, by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and virogenetic tools in suitable genetic mouse models, to address the physiological roles of NKB and Dyn in the dynamic control of GnRH neurosecretion, and their dependence on Kp signaling. The studies outlined in this proposal will substantially advance our understanding of basic neuroendocrine mechanisms for the control of fertility and will aid for the development of better strategies to treat reproductive abnormalities, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and in/ subfertility related to metabolic disorders.",1,1
630,110612,Yes,Real-time monitoring of load induced remodeling in tissue-engineered bone,"The maintenance of the skeleton is tightly coupled with balanced bone formation and resorption processes that are mediated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Loss of this balance results in skeletal pathologies representing some of the most significant public health threats faced by the growing and ageing population. Tissue engineering investigates various health aspects such as drug development, fundamental research and regenerative medicine. State-of-the-art approaches are lacking to mimic one essential functional property of bone: to adapt its 3D morphology according to imposed mechanical loads. As most drugs for skeletal diseases act on this anabolic-catabolic balance, an engineered system serving as a human in vitro model for drug discovery/testing needs to be able to mimic this process. This proposal aims at combining real-time monitoring of mineralized extracellular matrix with bone tissue engineering culture standards in advanced bioreactors and will design a reliable 3D in vitro model system to mimic load induced remodeling of tissue-engineered human bone. The following particulars will be systematically addressed: i) Establishment of a co-culture of human bone-forming cells and human bone resorbing cells capable of mimicking bone remodeling; ii) Real-time monitoring platform in 3D in order to take the temporo-spatial development of the tissue into account and to allow specific adapted and controlled interventions depending on the actual environmental situation; iii) Quantitative simulation of morphological bone adaptation induced by mechanical load. The proposed research activity will have important implications in fields ranging from pharmacology and biotechnology to biomechanics and medicine. It will result in a ground-breaking platform that could be applied to screen initial bone drug effects and will improve our fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in normal and diseased bone conditions.",1,1
502,30824,No,Study of the Indirect and Direct Influences on Climate of Anthropogenic Trace Gas Emissions,"To improve the understanding of the direct and indirect climate inluences of anthropogenic trace species in the atmosphere.     The main focus is on the estimation and explanation of changes in atmospheric chemistry and consequent climate forcings caused by radiatively active gases and aerosols.   The project is a combined effort by researchers in the field of atmospheric chemistry and climate modelling, and is building upon the collaboration and results obtained during the first SINDICATE project.   The chemistry general circulation model ECHAM, which includes troposphere and stratosphere descriptions of higher hydrocarbon and heterogeneous chemistry schemes, descriptions of aerosol formation, growth and removal processes, and a radiation scheme to calculate radiative forcings, will be further developed.   The off-line transport/chemistry model TM2 will likewise be further developed. The model uses ECMWF and ECHAM calculated meteorological fields, and is extended to include higher hydrocarbon and heterogeneous chemistry schemes, descriptions of aerosol formation, growth and removal processes, and a radiation scheme to calculate climate forcings.   A 'Zoom' model of TM2 model (1 by 1 horizontal resolution) will be developed for use on regional scales (e. g. Europe) for comparison with data from measurin campaigns and relatively dense monitoring networks.   The ECHAM and TM2 models will be validated by systematic comparisons between calculated and observed concentrations of NMHC, CH4, NOx, CO, SO2, and the reaction products ozone, sulfate and nitrate.   Based on these developments direct and indirect climate forcings for changing concentrations of NMHC, CH4, CFCs, N2O, NOx, CO and SO2 will be calculated. The climate responses from changing NMHC, CH4, CFCs, N2O, NOx , CO, and SO2 emissions and concentrations for the period from 1880 to present will be established and compared with observed trends in temperature, precipitation and trace gas concentrations.   The impact of the Pinatubo eruption on the concentration of stratospheric ozone and the effects on the temperature and the circulation in the stratosphere will be calculated and compared with observations.",0,0
679,196876,Yes,Justice and the Family: An Analysis of the Normative Significance of Procreation and Parenthood in a Just Society,"This project examines the normative significance of procreation and parenthood for theories of justice. Important questions of justice about the family arise once we acknowledge and keep in view that procreation and parenthood are both integral to the existence of any society (and therefore, a just society), and that they involve substantial benefits and burdens for parents, children, and society at large. Yet existing theories of justice generally neglect these questions by assuming that the principles they formulate are to regulate the main institutions of societies constituted by fully formed adult individuals whose creation and care are taken as given.  The project identifies and analyses three main sets of questions about family justice: 1) Does justice require that parents and non-parents share, and share equally, the costs and benefits of having children, and how do different answers to this question bear on our theory of distributive justice? 2) What are the claims of justice that we have as children, how do they relate to those we have as adults, and who bears the correlative duties? 3) Do all contemporaries, regardless of whether they are parents or non-parents, have the same obligations of justice towards future generations, and how, if at all, are the justification and the content of those obligations affected by considerations about what parents owe their children and parents and non-parents owe to each other? Addressing these questions contributes to developing normative-theoretical framework needed to address pressing public policy concerns, and also turns out to be more central to the formulation of a complete and defensible theory of justice than political philosophers have realised to date.",0,1

The tool will be applied to three different electrolysis technologies in a parallel effort: proton exchange membrane electrolysers, alkaline electrolysers and anion exchange membrane electrolysers. With this tool, which will include relevant sensors, the operating conditions will be monitored on-line. Test protocols for normal operation and accelerated ageing operation modes will be applied to the systems with the aim to identify critical operating conditions by means of the new integrated diagnostic tool. Parallel to these in-situ diagnostics, ex-situ investigations of electrolyser components, such as electrodes and membranes, will support the approach. Fresh and aged samples will be studied, in steady interaction with the in-situ diagnostics, to identify the mechanisms leading to performance losses and failure of components. These two approaches will be combined to find strategies and operation parameters to anticipate and to avoid hazardous operation modes. The possible use of electrolysers as decentralised storage systems for excess electric energy and thus providing a sustainable energy carrier in form of hydrogen will require a reliable operation under varying loads.",0,0
890,99323,No,Aerogel-Based Composite/Hybrid Nanomaterials for Cost-Effective Building Super-Insulation Systems,"In the context of global climate control policies, improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings represents a great challenge, worldwide as well as at the European level. Reducing the energy consumption of buildings is nowadays preferably achieved by increasing the thermal resistance of the insulation layer in the building envelope. The AEROCOINs project will make a significant contribution to the future reduction of energy consumption by decreasing heating and cooling demands of existing-buildings. A clever combination of sol-gel science and nanotechnology can greatly advance design and development of novel superinsulating aerogels. The AEROCOINs project proposes to create a new class of mechanically strong superinsulating aerogel composite/hybrid materials by overcoming the two major obstacles which have endured for so long and have prevented a more wide-spread use of silica-based aerogel insulation components in the building industry: i) strengthening of silica aerogels by cross-linking with cellulosic polymers or the incorporation of cellulose-based nanofibres and ii) lowering the production cost of monolithic plates or boards of composite/hybrid aerogel materials via ambient drying and continuous production technology. Acting on these two incentives, new superinsulating aerogel-based monolithic materials with improved thermo-mechanical properties will be synthesized at the laboratory scale, developed further to the pilot scale under the shape of superinsulating panels, integrated in well-suited envelope components which will then be used for energy and ageing evaluation purposes via the integration of the aerogel-based components in a demonstration wall. In addition, a complete LCA study of the component will be realized and a fabrication concept for cost effective mass production (based on a continuous elaboration process) will be laid out for further pre-industrial development",0,0
1107,35527,No,Intelligent semi-autonomous vehicles in materials handling,"Foreseen Results  Virtual engineering for industrial mobile robotics/vehicles; a virtual design environment is used for pre-emptive learning / training of intelligent semi-autonomous human guided vehicles and the optimisation of operation strategies. Advanced control architectures for intelligent semi-autonomous vehicles and intelligent guided vehicles. New smart sensing techniques for industrial mobile robotics/vehicles. A fundamentally new approach in building the control and sensing infrastructures for mobile vehicles applying field-bus type control networks The primary aim of this research is to improve the operation, safety, self protection, efficiency and flexibility of semi-autonomous guided vehicles / assembly carriers through intelligent control and smart sensing techniques in materials handling and related applications. This will lead to safer, highly effective and responsive man-in-the-loop materials handling in manufacturing environments (e.g. automotive assembly) and hazardous environments (e.g. nuclear plants, mine clearance, bomb disposal, etc.).  Manufacturing industry and other industrial sectors require the extensive movement of products, tools and materials through out the production process. Materials handling is therefore an extremely important aspect of the overall manufacturing process which adds value by changing the temporal and spatial arrangement of products and materials inline with manufacturing goals. Assembly carriers and guided mobile robots are used to meet some of the materials handling needs, particularly in industries such as automotive manufacturing where the product and materials tend to be large and heavy which are difficult to manipulate by other means. Such handling systems need to be highly flexible to meet changing production schedules and transportation routings. The concept of semi-autonomous vehicles is both novel and timely for manufacturing and other sectors in meeting the need for improved performance, safer operation, flexibility and ease of use. Semi-autonomous intelligent vehicles (with remote operators) also offer great potential in hazardous environments in applications such as nuclear plant maintenance/decommissioning, surveillance, mine clearance, and bomb disposal. There will be four main aspects to the research proposed here, namely: the development of a reactive behavioral control architecture suitable for 'semi-autonomous guided vehicles' (such as assembly carriers) and 'intelligent guided vehicles' (capable of navigating locally from the guide wire to avoid obstacles in the manufacturing plant or related environment) to provide easier use, increased self protection, safer operation and improved functionality. the creation of 'virtual environments' to allow the 'pre-emptive learning' of behaviors for the semi- autonomous vehicles (e.g. to reduce dramatically on-site training and to improve the operation of the vehicle). Computer aided graphical simulation tools will be created to model the vehicle, the sensors, its environment and its interaction in an event based emulation that closely matches the real application environment. the integration and development of distributed control and sensing architectures for'semi-autonomous guided vehicles' and 'intelligent wire guided vehicles'. The resulting integrated architectures will embody smart sensing and control objects which are both co-operative and autonomous. the development of smart sensors appropriate for intelligent vehicle guidance systems (in particular novel digital signal processing techniques and piezo-materials for ultrasonic sensors will be studied).",0,0
846,210551,No,Adaptive Actin Architectures,"Although we have extensive knowledge of many important processes in cell biology, including information on many of the molecules involved and the physical interactions among them, we still do not understand most of the dynamical features that are the essence of living systems. This is particularly true for the actin cytoskeleton, a major component of the internal architecture of eukaryotic cells.  In living cells, actin networks constantly assemble and disassemble filaments while maintaining an apparent stable structure, suggesting a perfect balance between the two processes. Such behaviors are called “dynamic steady states”. They confer upon actin networks a high degree of plasticity allowing them to adapt in response to external changes and enable cells to adjust to their environments. Despite their fundamental importance in the regulation of cell physiology, the basic mechanisms that control the coordinated dynamics of co-existing actin networks are poorly understood. In the AAA project, first, we will characterize the parameters that allow the coupling among co-existing actin networks at steady state. In vitro reconstituted systems will be used to control the actin nucleation patterns, the closed volume of the reaction chamber and the physical interaction of the networks. We hope to unravel the mechanism allowing the global coherence of a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Second, we will use our unique capacity to perform dynamic micropatterning, to add or remove actin nucleation sites in real time, in order to investigate the ability of dynamic networks to adapt to changes and the role of coupled network dynamics in this emergent property. In this part, in vitro experiments will be complemented by the analysis of actin network remodeling in living cells. In the end, our project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how the adaptive response of the cytoskeleton derives from the complex interplay between its biochemical, structural and mechanical properties.",0,0
850,94017,No,Systems biology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in biofilms,"Systems biology is a new and rapidly growing discipline. It is widely believed to have a broad transformative potential on both basic and applied studies in the life sciences. In particular, metabolic network reconstructions are playing a key role as they provide a framework for investigation of the mechanism underlying the genotype-phenotype relationship. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen of clinical relevance with an increasing resistance against available antibiotics, which is partially attributed to its ability to form biofilms. The proposed project will construct a comprehensive biofilm model of P. aeruginosa using a recently published metabolic reconstruction. The biofilm model will represent typical micro-habitats. Hence, it will give insight into distinct metabolic difference of planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria and may further our understanding as to why biofilm bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. Metabolomic, patient samples will be integrated with the biofilm model which is expected to yield insight into conditions associated with disease progression and manifestation. The biofilm model will also be employed to predict new strategies for therapeutic interventions through in silico gene deletion studies. The project will include the development of relevant reconstruction and analysis methods. This work will set new standards in reconstruction, analysis, and modeling techniques and will build the first large-scale bacterial-community-based network. Gained knowledge will be directly applicable to other single or multi-species bacterial communities.

86,67971,Yes,Explosive eruption risk and decision support for eu populations threatened by volcanoes,"In the last few decades the population worldwide has become concentrated in age conurbations at high risk from volcanic disasters. The most serious hazards are represented by the occurrence of pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout at European cities on explosive volcanoes and volcanic islands. Whatever the policy to mitigate such a huge risk might be, quantification of risk in association with a range of eruption scenarios, their impact, and mitigation are the fundamental priorities. This project addresses these critical issues by advancing critical scientific and technological facilities (i.e. the infrastructures), needed in volcanic risk assessment and mitigation, such as the computer models to simulate the process dynamics, the vulnerability databases, and the probabilistic risk assessment protocol. The project also aims to apply these facilities to those European volcanoes at high risk Vesuvius, Soufriere, Sete Cidades, Teide) so that they become a technology platform for exploitation at volcanoes throughout the world capable of supporting officials in deciding development and planning priorities as well as decision making in volcanic crises.",1,1
623,201605,Yes,Identifying biomarkers of Exposure leading to Lung Cancer with Adductomics,"Over 20% of death by cancer in the world are due to Lung Cancer (LC).  Tobacco, and recently, exposure to air pollution, are considered the main causes for LC, thus specific carcinogens have been only partially identified. The complex composition of tobacco smoke and air pollution makes it difficult to identify the specific compounds responsible for the carcinogenesis process. To understand the mechanisms of LC onset, methods are needed to characterize specific toxicants that people are exposed to. We propose to develop a new method to identify exposure-specific (tobacco or air pollution) markers of LC. This new method is based on the measure of the ensemble of electrophile-carcinogens and human serum albumin adducts in human serum:  the Adductome. Electrophiles present in blood are highly reactive species that have been long suspected of causing cancer because of their ability to bind DNA and proteins. Protein adducts provide more suitable markers of exposure as they have a longer life span in the blood and are present in much higher concentrations, but have been poorly investigated. In EXACT we hypothesise that protein-carcinogen electrophiles adducts can be used as markers of LC carcinogenesis and that different markers can be identified for tobacco-induced or air pollution-induced disease. Our objective is to improve the current analytical methodology for adductomics analysis and develop a new methodology for adducts structural identification in order to characterize adduct profiles in 400 samples of human serum from the EPIC cohort. Statistical analyses will be carried out to link adducts profiles to smoking status, air pollution data and methylation profiles. The elucidation of the markers structure will allow us to establish a database of candidate compounds responsible for the carcinogenicity of tobacco and air pollution. EXACT will serve as a proof of concept to develop a novel technique based on the use of the Adductome to elucidate disease causality.",1,1
370,186743,No,Resource Allocation and Policy Choice through Democratic Bargaining or Conflict,"When a group of agents has to choose one action from a given set of feasible actions, it faces a collective-choice problem. If agents have different information about the consequences of each action, or different preferences over consequences, agents have different preferences over the action they want the group to take. The group must make a choice aggregating these divergent preferences. For instance, citizens of any given country have different policy preferences that are aggregated to generate a policy outcome. One way to aggregate conflicting preferences to make a choice is through conflict: agents exert competing costly efforts in a confrontation, and the group choice is determined, perhaps probabilistically, by these efforts. Alternatively, in democratic societies, group actions, such as policies, are chosen by means of bargaining and voting. In an indirect or representative democracy, citizens elect representatives, who bargain over policy proposals. Ultimately, a policy is approved by voting, and becomes the group choice. I propose to study the problem of resource allocation and ideological policy-making, both at the national level in the realm of domestic political economy, and at the supranational level in the context of international relations, through the lens of the game-theoretic advances in collective choice and social choice theory. I will study the problem of allocating a fixed amount of a resource or desirable good to a set of agents (citizens, regions, industries, or countries) with conflicting claims, and the related problem of choosing an ideological policy outcome when agents affected by the policy have divergent preferences over outcomes, and I will compare the solutions that are obtained if outcomes are determined by conflict, or by voting in a representative democracy with a presidential, or with a parliamentarian system.

Spectral Photon Counting Computed Tomography (SPCCT) is a new imaging modality, currently in development, with a totally new type of detection chain designed to provide high count-rate capabilities while offering energy discrimination with high spatial resolution of 200µm. Based on this discrimination, SPCCT can detect and quantify accurately a large variety of atoms (including Gadolinium, Gold, Bismuth…) by using the K-edge technique. SPCCT, by a more accurate, less invasive (in comparison with IVUS and coronary angiography) and reliable evaluation of vascular inflammation will allow earlier disease diagnosis such as plaque inflammation before rupture, leading to improved clinical decisions and outcomes. This will be achievable with a high spatial resolution combined to the newly developed vascular inflammation specific contrast agent detected with high quality K-edge technique that can only be provided by a multi-spectral X-ray system. The project will therefore provide a complete tool (acquisition system and specific probes) dedicated to CV imaging. It will finally contribute to: Improved early diagnosis of atherosclerosis, prevention of acute event (MI, stroke) and personalized preventive treatment; Improved management of patient presenting with an acute CV event and clinical validation of treatment efficiency; Sustainability and harmonization of healthcare systems, as costly disorders of heart failure and stroke-related disability would be better prevented and efficiently treated; Economic growth in the EU diagnostics sector, through the development of new targeted contrast materials for SPCCT by SMEs.",1,1

The SENIEUR protocol, developed under EURAGE, specifies criteria for the healthy elderly for inclusion in studies on normal ageing. As a consequence some generally accepted age related changes were proven not to be due to ageing but to disease processes. These changes include a decrease in the number of immunological T-cells and an increase in the frequency of autoimmune phenomena. During ageing involution of the thymus occurs leaving the elderly with a lack of immume reactivity especially against new infectious challenges. New strategies were developed for the improvement of both overall immunity and vaccination efficiency in the elderly. Combined European clinical and experimental studies in the field of influenza vaccination are currently underway. In the field of brain ageing and dementia, diagnostic criteria have been set out in neuropathology. Catalogues of brain tissue banks from normal and demented persons have been made available with a view to investigation of a genetic basis for senile dementia. Studies on lens ageing were aimed at the development of strategies for cataract prevention or to delay the progression of early opacities by the use of anti cataract agents or the elimination of risk factors. The results indicate that anti oxidant therapy is not likely to be successful, most probably inhibitors of oxidant metabolism will be more useful. A study of hepatic ageing allowed the clarification of the mechanisms of impaired drug clearance in the elderly and the development of new techniques for the study of the increased sensitivity of ageing organisms to drug effects. Also the relation between Kupffer cell functions and the susceptability to infection in old age was thoroughly investigated in conjuncti on with metabolic and endocrine response to injury and trauma. Finally, EURAGE resulted in the formal classification of 4 categories of monoclonal gammapathies resulting in new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients suffering from these disorders. In most European countries the over-65 age group constitutes the most rapidly increasing segment of the population and, thereby, presents unprecedented challenges to the medical care systems of each country. The resources which are presently available and those planned for the near future fall far short of the projected needs brought about by the virtual doubling of this population segment by the year 2020.   The past record of the success of biomedical research in controlling human diseases and the ensuring savings resulting from reduced morbidity and mortality justify a substantial investment of funds and resources for the stimulation and coordination of European research activities. These should be directed at a detailed understanding of the genetic and biochemical basis of age-related diseases and the fundamental causes of the ageing process itself.   The increase in the number of older Europeans, as well as the incidence of age-related diseases and the large monetary sums allocated to health care for elderly persons led to the EC's concerted action in the discipline of medial gerontology (EURAGE).",1,1
374,73342,No,Learningful Work - Increasing Employees' Learning Opportunities' at Work. An International Comparison.,"The research project studies the elements of meaningful work: work enabling an employee to learn and develop. The importance of continuous learning at work cannot be exaggerated in the complex world, where organizational success has to be built on employees&apos; individual and collective competencies. Work in itself has to be &quot;learningful&quot;. To complement professional training and companies&apos; training efforts, daily work has to offer opportunities for learning - for continuous individual and organizational development.  The research project has the following objectives: first, to study work and organizational characteristics conductive to or hindering meaningful work; second, to contribute to the development of a method enabling the assessment of the degree to which work is meaningful; third, to study how organizational cultures and managerial approaches contribute to the meaningfulness of work; and fourth, to study national differences in organizational cultures and managerial approaches contributing to meaningful work and the existence of work and organizational characteristics conductive to it. The objectives are achieved by studying packaging industry companies in Finland, Germany, and Sweden with a research method called &quot;the Meaningful Index&quot; combining interview, observation, and survey data on a work process. The project brings together a promising researcher, a research project allowing her to gain further competencies both relating to scientific expertise and methodological proficiency, as well a host institute providing the researcher an opportunity to work on the research project together with a research group with complementary skills and competencies to her own. While the candidate is proficient in qualitative methodology and &quot;good work&quot;-studies, the host institute brings in the project its personnel&apos;s quantitative methodology competencies as well as expertise in learning at work.",0,0
129,69858,Yes,Mechanisms of ochratoxin a induced carcinogenicity as a basis for an improved risk assessment,"Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin which contaminates a variety of human food. In experimental animals, ochratoxin A is nephrotoxic and induces tumors, in the kidney, but also in other organs of rodents. In humans, exposure to high levels of ochratoxin An in diet has been linked with chronic renal disease (Balkan endemic nephropathy, interstitial nephritis) and an increased incidence of urinary tract tumours. The proposal includes novel approaches to study mechanisms of ochratoxin A tumorigenicity to kidney and combines studies in vivo and in relevant in vitro models to investigate the occurrence and nature of damage to DNA and other macromolecules induced by ochratoxin A and its metabolites. These studies include sophisticated analytical chemistry and applications of molecular biology to a toxicological problem. After completion, an improved understanding of mechanisms resulting in DNA-damage by ochratoxin A will be obtained.",1,1
390,196024,No,New Disruptive Platform Technology for Water Treatment and Process Intensification,"Millions of m3 per year of chemically and biologically contaminated wastewater from medical and specialty chemical sectors contaminate Europe water resources and has the potential to be reused using a novel cost-effective technology that developed in OsciLEDs. This proposal will evolve a disruptive platform technology for treatment of fluids (e.g. wastewater), which synergistically exploits two highly innovative processes: i) an oscillatory baffled column (OBC) and ii) wireless power of suspended UV light emitting diodes (WP UV-LEDs). This highly innovative combination intensifies the treatment of contaminated fluids by maximizing mixing and reactants mass transfer, while minimizing to the limit the irreducible volumetric irradiation gradients present in photoreactors. The synergistic effect of these two highly innovative processes will result in at least one-order of magnitude improvement in fluid effluent quality in comparison with the current state-of-the-art, an estimated 50% reduction of operational costs and one-order of magnitude reduction in reactor footprint. This is a completely new concept of photoreactor design, representing cutting-edge technological development for environmental applications, and in the photochemical synthesis sector (e.g., pharmaceuticals). Dr Lucas (Experienced Researcher, h-index 11, > 650 citations) has a significant background in the field of environmental remediation. Prof. Li Puma (PI, h-index 26, > 1600 citations) is a world leader in photoreactor design. During this project, an OBC recently commissioned and patented at Loughborough will be further developed to incorporate WP UV-LED sources. The performance of a new pilot-scale photoreactor will be evaluated for removal of emerging contaminants and for treatment of real hospital wastewater effluents. The purpose is to protect the IP generated and developing commercial prototypes for application in drinking and wastewater treatment, improving water quality and reuse.",0,0
266,74241,No,"Sustainability Impact Assessment: Tools for Environmental, Social and Economic Effects of Multifunctional Land Use in European Regions","Sustainability of land use in European regions is a central point of policy and management decisions at different levels of governance. Implementation of European policies designed to promote and protect multifunctional land use requires the urgent development of robust tools for the assessment of different scenarios' impacts on the environmental and socio-economic sustainability. The technical objective of SENSOR is to build, validate and implement sustainability impact assessment tools (SIAT), including databases and spatial reference frameworks for the analysis of land and human resources in the context of agricultural, regional and environmental policies. The scientific challenge is to establish relationships between different environmental and socio-economic processes as characterised by indicators considered to be quantitative measures of sustainability. Scenario techniques will be used within an integrated modelling framework, reflecting various aspects of multifunctionality and their interactions. The focus will be on European sensitive regions, particularly those in accession countries, since accession poses significant questions for policy makers regarding the socio-economic and environmental effect of existing and proposed land use policies. SIAT will utilise the statistical and spatial data continuously collected by European and regional agencies. SENSOR will deliver novel solutions for integrated modelling, spatial and temporal scaling and aggregation of data, selection of indicators, database management, analysis and prediction of trends, education and implementation. SIAT will be made available to decision makers at the European and regional level, providing user-friendly interfaces and scientifically sound procedures for the assessment of environmental and monetary responses of policy options. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of policy implementation will be an integral part of the SIAT's functions.",0,0
542,225718,Yes,Revealing dendritic cell-CD4+ T cell communication by using synthetic biology in vivo,"CD4\ T cells are crucial component of our immune system: they support distinct types of proinflammatory responses key for pathogen clearance, maintain tolerance and suppress harmful inflammation. To perform this multitude of functions, naïve CD4\ T cells first undergo activation through direct contact with dendritic cells (DCs), a highly heterogeneous compartment including several populations of migratory and resident cells. These interactions lead to selection of antigen specific T cell clones, followed by their proliferation and differentiation into distinct subsets showing specialized effector programs or polarizations. Despite the essential role of dendritic cells in the activation and polarization of naïve CD4\ T cells, we have limited information available on both the identity of DC involved in priming and the molecular messages exchanged upon DC-CD4\ T cell interaction in different types of response. Recently, I developed an innovative technology that allows us for the first time to label interactions between immune cells in vivo. This method, which we called LIPSTIC, relies on the labeling of genetically engineered receptor–ligand pairs mediated by the enzyme Sortase A. After the enzymatic reaction takes place in vivo, the history of ligand–receptor interactions is revealed by the presence of reporter tags easily detected by flow cytometry. This proposal aims to determine how interactions between dendritic cells and T cells instruct CD4\ T cells toward distinct fates using LIPSTIC and by implementing other technologies designed ad hoc to measure and understand the biological consequences of relevant cell-cell interactions on T cell fate decision. The combined approaches described here will contribute to the characterization of the molecular signals governing CD4\ T cell response in vivo.",1,1
606,89288,Yes,Study of the functional role of microRNAs in the eye,"The eye is a highly specialized organ whose development and function requires a precise coordination and timing of morphogenetic and cell differentiation events. However, in spite of the recent significant advances in the field, also facilitated by the human and the mouse genomic sequencing efforts, the transcriptional control of this complex network of events is still poorly understood. This project aims at gaining further insights into the control of gene expression in eye tissue and cell types, by identifying novel microRNA-mediated mechanisms that may greatly contribute to this complex function. microRNAs are 21-25 nucleotide small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Although several microRNAs are reported to be expressed in ocular tissues, their role in the eye transcriptome is completely unknown. In this project, we aim at the identification, detailed characterization and functional analysis of microRNAs expressed in the non-retinal parts of the eye, such as lens, cornea and ciliary body. In particular, we will select and characterize microRNAs with a presumptive role in eye development and function, by first carrying out detailed expression analysis in mouse by RNA in situ hybridization to establish their spatiotemporal localization. The selected eye-expressed miRNAs will be further evaluated to identify, by bioinformatics approaches, followed by in vitro experimental validation procedures, their putative target genes. Finally, these miRNAs will be analyzed from a functional point of view, by means of overexpression and loss-of-function studies, both using in vitro (cell cultures) and in vivo (medaka) systems. We believe that this effort should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling gene expression in the eye and may also contribute to the identification of novel pathogenetic mechanisms for eye pathological conditions.",1,1
491,100081,No,Comprehensive European Approach to the Protection of Civil Aviation,"Security has become a major factor in civil/commercial aviation. In recent decades, the number of threats to aviation security has grown significantly, especially after 9/11. This has led to ever more security regulations as the threats evolve. Security procedures have become exceedingly complex and invasive to passenger privacy; the number of security measures as well as personnel and therefore costs are growing steadily. At the same time passenger and cargo traffic are expected to double in the next 15 years. Already today, security is one of the main reasons for delayed take-off. It is clear that the current complex security system cannot be adapted to such a growth without a large rise in costs. It has already and will increasingly become a major market restraint. Therefore, the proposed project COPRA aims to answer two questions: • How does the threat situation in civil aviation evolve in the future, taking into account both existing and new technologies and their continuing development and proliferation? • Which opportunities arise from the development and proliferation of new technologies and security procedures to overcome the current complex and expensive security situation and to enable sustainable growth for the future? COPRA’s main objective is to answer both questions in a way that will constitute the optimal balance between security, privacy, public acceptability, mobility and costs, while providing ideas on how to increase flexibility and resilience of the whole aviation system against threats. To that aim COPRA brings together a well balanced consortium of research organisations, industry and major air transport providers with a wide range of European stakeholders. End-users, technology providers, policy makers and think tanks will be involved in COPRA through the formation of expert groups. The involvement of these expert groups is essential to the success of COPRA’s objectives.",0,0
447,209252,No,Behavioural Economics in Network Games,"Three aspects of social interaction shall be combined, namely the diffusion of information in a social network, the formation of social networks, and behavioural (i.e. irrational) aspects in decision making. These three areas are crucially interdependent:  1) unwelcome information and irrational behaviour may lead to a change in a person’s circle of friends and thereby to a change in the social network; 2) the network itself and the (potentially irrational) processing of information influences the information diffusion in a society; 3) the decisions that have to be made with respect to network formation can be influenced by the disutility of unwelcome information rather than the utility of being correctly informed and thereby lead to irrational behaviour. This shall allow for an integrated approach in the analysis of social dynamics. While the three parts of this project already form an ambitious project that will provide considerable academic impact, they will also lead to interesting follow ups and spin-off research that is highly relevant in the upcoming years, such as the analysis of information diffusion in social networks prior to the European Election in 2019, and to applications outside academia, such as optimising product placement and advertisement in social networks, or the development of measures that prevent vigilantism in social networks. The combination of network formation, innovation diffusion, and behavioural economics is not only a novel approach to these rather young research areas with potential impact in economics, psychology, social sciences, and even computer sciences; it is also a highly relevant topic for modern societies where social media play a crucial role in daily communication and information aggregation. This project will therefore not only add to our understanding of social dynamics and  thereby push the academic boundaries, it will also have clear practical implications that allow for a broad exploitation of the research results.",1,0
356,22828,No,REFRIGERATION AND AUTOMOTIVE CLIMATE SYSTEMS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,"A completely new refrigeration cycle for air-conditioning with carbon dioxide technology was developed. The main emphasis was placed on the thermodynamic calculation of the cycle and the components according to a revised specification, the development of the components such as compressor, heat exchangers, means for control and expansion, storage vessels and refrigerant hoses, test bench investigations, construction of two vehicles, vehicle tests in wind tunnels and road tests and the evaluation of safety and costs aspects. Following this, a direct comparison to a current serial air-conditioning system under commonly acknowledged conditions became possible.  An automotive air-conditioning system is often operated above the critical temperature of CO(2) at 31.1°C. Therefore a CO(2) system will mostly work in a transcritical cycle mostly. At supercritical conditions (critical pressure: 73.8 bar), pressure and temperature are independent of each other. The conditions in the evaporator remain subcritical. In this transcritical cycle the refrigeration capacity, the compressor work and thereby the cycle efficiency depend on the existing discharge pressure in accordance with the heat rejection temperature. The optimum discharge pressure is a function of the ambient temperature. The refrigeration circuit control should provide sufficient cooling capacity at high efficiency with satisfying passenger comfort, largely independent from the momentary driving and climate conditions.  The vehicle refrigeration circuit consists of a compressor, gas cooler, expansion device, evaporator, accumulator and internal heat exchanger. The packaging shows only slight differences to series vehicles. The small cross-section of the refrigerant pipes makes it easier to find a route through the tight engine compartment. The refrigeration cycle with CO(2) operates at high pressure levels, but this does not represent an significantly increased risk with adapted components. Due to refrigerant properties the new developed components remain nearly comparable in respect of weight and dimensions.  The RACE project has shown that with CO(2) systems undiminished efficiency, capacity and passenger comfort and safety can be reached. At high thermal load, the system performance can be considerably better. This applies to comparisons made with highly developed state of the art systems. The physiological characteristics of CO(2) must be taken into account by careful design and by adjusted production, service and use in the vehicle. This will result in extra components, like sensor and will require a higher level of skills.  The direct effect of refrigerant emissions from HFC-based automobile air-conditioners is a significant part of the TEWI. The leakage scenario of R134a defines the amount of reduction on global warming. The assumed extra weight for the air-conditioning CO(2) system is 3 kg. The system environmental evaluation with a European and North-American user profile and emissions scenario showed a reduction in global warming emissions of 18% to 70%. For a mid sized vehicle, the diminishing of the overall global warming by phasing out HFC-134a refrigerant is between 2% and 8%. The energy consumption for operating CO(2) systems is in the same range as conventional HFC systems. The CO(2) A/C-system allows high passenger comfort with a maximum of ecological compatibility. Serious technical arguments against a vehicle long-term application of the transcritical cycle are not seen during the project. The cost reduction potential of a conventional cycle cannot be reached by the CO(2) system. A successful introduction of the new refrigerants needs a world wide acceptance from the international car industry, only one 'Mobile Air-Conditioning Standard Refrigerant' is suitable in the future. The proposed research is directed at developing a refrigeration cycle for use in automotive air conditioning systems. The new cycle will use a naturally occurring gas as a refrigerant. Because of the new refrigerants properties and the common working conditions of an automotive a/c cycle it will be necessary to develop a completely new transcritical vapour compression system.  Major tasks are:  (I) Calculation of thermodynamic cycle and of components based on typical car specifications  (II) Development of components - compressor, heat exchangers, expansion device, control device, receiver and hoses -  (III) Bench tests  (IV) Construction of prototypes  (V) Car tests in windtunnel and in-field  (VI) Safety & Acoustics evaluation  Successful completion will provide a long-term solution for an environmentally harmless refrigeration system.",0,0
646,78570,Yes,Breath-gas analysis for molecular-oriented detection of minimal diseases,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the western world. Diagnosis of cancer often happens late in the course of the disease since available diagnostic methods are not sufficiently sensitive and specific. An early diagnosis of cancer could save thousands of lives a year. There is strong evidence that particulate cancers can be detected by molecular analysis of exhaled air. Breath analysis represents a new non-invasive diagnostic which can provide information beyond conventional analysis of blood and urine. Recent results suggest that detection of cancer is possible by means of breath analysis in very early stages of the disease. This project is focused onto the diagnosis of minimal disease and early stages of lung and oesophageal cancer. The analytical techniques used will be GC-MS, PTR-MS, SIFT-MS and laser spectrometry. In order to establish a reliable clinical method for the diagnosis of minimal residual cancer diseases clinical expertise, basic research and technical development is necessary. The European consortium set up for this proposal represents exquisite knowledge in the field of basic and clinical research and technical development. Based on its competence, the consortium has the expertise to investigate and screen for hundreds of molecules in the exhaled breath and the statistical tools to identify specific cancer markers. The objectives of the project are - the development of sensitive and specific markers for the detection of early cancer stages based on human breath - reliable analytical methods to determine these markers in the clinical environment - easy-to-use and non-expensive equipment establishing breath analysis as a novel cancer screening tool. To get a better understanding of the interplay between blood and breath concentrations of volatile components, the blood-gas kinetics will be modeled. Two SMEs will devesubsequent use in clinical applications.",1,1
692,86647,Yes,Recuring breast cancer early genetic diagnostic on a chip,"The overall objective of RBCE-GenoDiagnoSens is to exploit breakthroughs at the confluences of micro-, nano- and bio-technologies to initiate the creation of a low-cost minimally-invasive intelligent diagnosis system using a nanotechnology-based device for the early detection of DNA biomarkers involved in breast cancer, especially found in circulating tumour cells (CTCs). The device will consist of an array of nano-biosensors for the consecutive RNA/DNA analysis of cancer cells. The advantages of the exploited biosensors for RNA/DNA analysis are their sensitivity, their inherent selectivity, their versatility and their cost effectiveness.  Death from cancer is usually due to metastases that are formed by hematogenic or lymphatogenic spread of cancer cells from the primary disease site. Fortunately, only a subset of these persist and have the ability to form vascularised macro metastases. Therefore, the quantification and characterisation of circulating tumour cell mRNAs in order to define the metastatic potential is of clinical relevance and may prove valuable for monitoring disease progression and patients response to treatment, and assessing the risk for metastasis or recurrence. With prognostic implications, the quantities of mRNA markers in blood could indicate the stage of cancer progression and the need for more intensive therapeutic intervention to better the outcome of cancer patients. In the frame of the RBCE-GenoDiagnoSens, the leading research scientist will design, taylor and test the optimum surface chemistry for the functionalisation and operation of the nano-biosensors, following his established expertise in the field, while the host institution will provide the complementary knowledge and training in microfabrication, DNA expertise, mass-manufacturing, regulations and commercialisation consideration as routes for the researcher to establish his own autonomy and his progression to become a successful principal investigator within the European Union",1,1

The main activities that will be performed by the network include: a) building a Database on Impact Assessment Development in European Member states (DIADEM); b) exploring the relationship between the type of impact assessment, on one hand, and various regulatory quality indicators (e.g. legitimacy, efficiency, effectiveness, advocacy and private sector involvement in regulatory processes); c) disseminating knowledge on the current methodologies used for regulatory impact assessment and sustainability impact assessment; d) development of a website aimed at collecting and sharing relevant information on better lawmaking in Europe (www.enbr.org); e) performance of inter-disciplinary studies and analyses aimed at knowledge-sharing and lesson-drawing; f) organisation of thematic workshops for the purpose of improving awareness of the relevance of impact assessment for better lawmaking and sustainable development; g) publication of Annual Progress Reports on the state of implementation of impact assessment in EU member states, including also policy suggestions for national governments; h) exploration of new lines of research on better lawmaking from a multi-disciplinary perspective; i) networking activity aimed at fostering the coordination/harmonisation of impact assessment procedures in EU member states; j) ongoing dialogue with Commission and Council Working groups, with the Director and Experts of Better Regulation and with the OECD's Regulatory Reform Programme.",0,0
806,48065,No,Wildlife vaccination against rabies in difficult and emergency situation and its potential impact on the environment,"Sylvatic rabies has been partly eliminated from large parts of several Member States by oral immunisation of foxes, but a dramatic increase in fox population densities renders a complete eradication of the disease more difficult. More likely an irrepressible come back of the disease will be seen in the future in areas freed from the disease just a few years ago. This threat comes from remnant focii centralized in rabies-free areas and from non member-states where rabies remains present or on the increase. Selvatic rabies is an economic problem. It has a welfare impact, and constitutes a hindrance to free movement within the E.U.   The main organisations in charge of the control of rabies in 5 European countries and one laboratory of animal ecology are proposing the development of testing appropriate countermeasurements instead of the currently used and often non efficient classical oral vaccination of foxes. Information on the possible negative impact of rabies elimination must also be obtained which includes a significant increase of fox population. While several European teams are now organising heavy field trials aimed at vaccinating fox cubs, nothing is known about the immunological competency of fox cubs. Other new measures in practice consist in increasing the density of baits deposited or vaccinating the same areas two times within a short delay. These measures multiply the cost of rabies control.   This (suggested) project includes three trials on fox cubs including vaccination of pregnant vixen, and testing on fox cubs subsequently vaccinated or not. Also one must determine the stability of vaccines in use. In fact huge amounts of vaccines are made of viruses very temperature-sensitive.   In most European countries, no titre control is done after vaccine distribution. Well standardized protocols will be organised in every Partner country, which will probably give clues to the origin of some failures currently seen.   Also of importance is to define the optimal density of baits that need to be deposited in correlation with fox density. We will organise a specific field protocol in two Member States in areas inhabited by various fox population densities and three different densities of baits will be distributed. However the perequisite for this protocol is to define a common method for indexing fox density. In order to do this we will  (i) set Up one or two abundance indexes of fox density that will be easy to record by veterinary services, and  (ii) calibrate these indexes with more elaborate methods in order to correlate them with real (fox) density.   Double short delayed oral vaccination protocols will be tested on caged adult foxes for verifying that they provide a booster response significantly more protective than one single vaccination and the most appropriate delay between the first and the second distribution of baits will be determined.   It is impossible to compare national or regional vaccination programs because: (1) areas are not characterised with the same index or with correlated indexes of fox density, (ii) and even if the sampling of fox sera is consistent in areas, the ELISA methods in use in the Member States give very divergent results. We want to identify the main factors that influence efficacy of vaccination programmes, therefore, in order to compare the increase in the ratio of immunized foxes between areas vaccinated after campaigns, we will standardise and calibrate an ELISA test for fox serum samples taken in the fields. Using this standardised ELISA test, sera will be re-tested to allow a retrospective analysis in regard with the density and type of vaccine bait used, dates of campaigns, and methods of deposit.   Using this newly calibrated index of fox density and ELISA methods, an evaluation of the ongoing vaccination campaign will then be carried out. Relation between fox density, control methods and rabies advance or elimination will be investigated using mathematical models.   The results will allow the development of a computer programme package ready to use by veterinary units. A common tool for the molecular characterization of rabies strains is not currently employed in the surveillance and control of rabies in the E.U. An objective of this proposal will be to do this in one laboratory, in order to identify both the geographical and the species origin of isolates from remnant or unexpected focii. The main possible negative impact of the increase of fox density is a greater risk of the transmission of Alveolar echinococcosis to Humans. Methods for determining the frequency in fox feces of the causative agent of this disease (Echinococcus mulltilocularis) will be developed. This project will be carried out over a three year period. All results will be delivered to involved veterinary units, then published in scientific international journals. The benefit expected from this proposal will be to optimise the use of current funds already allocated by the E.U. for oral vaccination of foxes, no commercialisation will be considered from obtained results.",0,0
474,216189,No,The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response,"Mitochondria—organelles specialized in energy harvesting through oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos)—critically influence metabolism, health and lifespan. Evolved from endosymbiotic proteobacteria, mitochondria retained the vestige of the bacterial genome, the mitochondrial DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the Oxphos complexes, while the remaining ~80 Oxphos components and the rest of the mitochondrial proteome are encoded on nuclear DNA, translated in the cytoplasm and imported in the mitochondria. The control of the mitochondrial proteome by two genomes exposes these organelles to proteotoxic stress in case of an imbalance between the nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Upon such stress, several mitochondrial protein quality control (mtPQC) pathways, including the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), will sense, transmit and re-establish mitochondrial proteostasis through mitonuclear regulatory circuits. Although a robust UPRmt circuit improves health and lifespan in C. elegans, much less is known about mtPQC in vertebrates. We propose here to characterize UPRmt pathways across 3 species by: (1) mapping mammalian UPRmt genes and networks in vivo after the induction of the UPRmt in a large murine genetic reference population at 3 different times throughout life with 2 different inducers; (2) integrating these UPRmt networks with a wide set of clinical, mitochondrial, and molecular phenotypes collected throughout life to establish links between UPRmt mechanisms and health- and lifespan; (3) mechanistically validating the most important UPRmt pathways, using loss-of-function studies in cells, worms and mice; and (4) clinically translating promising UPRmt hits, using genetic association studies in human cohorts. The insight gained will mechanistically define the UPRmt networks from worms to humans and will provide the next step in translating the benefits of activating the UPRmt—initially observed in invertebrates—into targeted human therapies.",1,0
172,214241,Yes,The industrialization and market entry of a novel bioengineered hydrogel grid to standardize stem cell cultures for precision medicine.,"The ability to generate miniature organ models in a dish, termed organoids, from patient stem cells has opened endless possibilities for applications in precision medicine. SUN bioscience SA, a spin-off company of EPFL in Switzerland, was founded in 2016 with the ambition to move these organoid cultures from basic research to the Health Care industry.   To reach this goal, SUN bioscience has developed Gri3D, a microstructured biocompatible hydrogel platform, and aims to establish this technology as a new standard for growing organoids at industrial scale and precision. Gri3D prototypes have been field tested with over 30 European academic and pharmaceutical R&D groups. In addition, SUN bioscience has developed an industrial automated manufacturing mechanism for Gri3D that is now being translated into the world-wide first machine, Hydra I, that auomates liquid handling with hydrogel microembossing.  The objective of this feasibility study is to verify the technical, economical and practical viability of Gri3D and to ensure its successful market entry in Europe. Specifically, the first step is to validate the production capacity of Hydra I by producing 1’000 Gri3D units, which corresponds to one tenth of the total annual target production volume. In a second step, SUN bioscience aims to validate the market by commercializing these 1’000 Gri3D units to existing customers and to expand its customer base to a total of 20-40 recurrent clients.  According to our current strategy, SUN bioscience will run at maximum single line production capacity with cumulative revenues of >€2M within 3 years after market introduction of Gri3D. The 3D technologies market is expected to reach €600M by 2021. The long-term business objective is to implement organoid assays on Gri3D and to establish SUN bioscience as a leader in clinical diagnostics with the intention to initiate a phase 2 SME instrument project along this path.",1,1
594,64753,Yes,Human and animal metapneumovirus molecular and clinical studies for disease control,"A newly discovered virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), responsible for respiratory disease in young children, is closely related to subgroup C isolates of the prototype metapneumovirus, avian pneumovirus (APV). APV is a major cause of significant economic losses in the poultry industry in Europe. Current diagnostic techniques cannot detect these metapneumoviruses and as a result the significance and distribution of hMPV subgroup C APV are not known. Thus the burden of disease from these agents cannot be assessed. The proposal addresses these problems by generating new, standardised, detection and characterisation assays, developed for commercial use. Using reverse genetics techniques for both hMPV and APV, the molecular biology, aspects of pathogenicity and host specificity will be analysed This will also generate recombinant viruses which will be the foundation for future rational vaccine design.",1,1
57,105876,Yes,"Simulation of the Kinetics and Inverse Problem for the Protein PolymERization in Amyloid Diseases (Prion, Alzheimer’s)","Amyloid diseases are of increasing concern in our aging society. These diseases all involve the aggregation of misfolded proteins, called amyloid, which are specific for each disease (PrP for Prion, Abeta for Alzheimer's). When misfolded these proteins propagate the abnormal configuration and aggregate to others, forming very long polymers also called fibrils. Elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of these chain reactions is a major challenge of molecular biology: do polymers break or coalesce? Do  specific sizes polymerize faster? What is the size of the so-called nucleus, i.e., the minimum stable size for polymers?  On which part of the reactions should a treatment focus to arrest the disease ? Up to now, only very partial and partially justified answers have been provided. This is mainly due to the extremely high complexity of the considered processes, which may possibly involve an infinite number of species and reactions (and thus, an infinite system of equations).  The great challenge of this project is to design new mathematical methods in order to model fibril reactions, analyse experimental data, help the biologists to discover the key mechanisms of polymerization in these diseases, predict the effects of new therapies. Our approach is based on a new mathematical model which consists in the nonlinear coupling of a size-structured Partial Differential Equation (PDE) of fragmentation-coalescence type, with a small number of Ordinary Differential Equations. On the one hand, we shall solve new and broad mathematical issues, in the fields of PDE analysis, numerical analysis and statistics. These problems are mathematically challenging and have a wide field of applications. On the other hand we want to test their efficacy on real data, thanks to an already well-established collaboration with a team of biophysicists. With such a continuing comparison with experiments, we aim at constantly aligning our mathematical problems to biological concerns.",0,1
477,200197,No,"High Nature Value Farming: Learning, Innovation and Knowledge.","'High nature value (HNV) farmland designates “those areas in Europe where agriculture is a major land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both”. They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure. For national and local authorities, the European Union and the Common Agricultural Policy, and for stakeholders, the challenge is twofold:  •  to avoid further degradation and disappearance of HNV farming and increase their socio-economic viability: this could be done by collating, evaluating and disseminating innovations as tools for their development;  • to maintain their “natural value”, i.e the environmental services they provide to the society.  For these reasons, our consortium, an EIP Agri Focus Group and new partners, propose a network dedicated to supporting HNV farming, networking HNV areas covering a range of different farming systems across the EU, and to focussing on innovations improving simultaneously “socio-economic viability” and “environmental efficiency”.  Conceived as a “support service” for knowledge and innovation exchanges, the HNV-Link network will give a decisive new impetus to this sector, and will provide tools to organisations, actors and networks supporting HNV farmlands. The marginality of HNV areas in conventional research and development means that HNV farming-related innovation is rarely discussed in academic exchanges. Our thematic network, both grassroots-based and transnational, can really make a difference, by connecting farmers and innovation actors in line with the vision of the EIP-Agri “operational groups'.

730,88692,Yes,The Drosophila homolog of the human disease genes SPG6 and ichthyin - its role in BMP and TGF-beta signaling,"Spichthyin (Spict) is the Drosophila homolog of the human disease genes SPG6 (mutated in some hereditary spastic paraplegias) and ichthyin (mutated in some ichthyoses). The host lab has recently assigned a cellular role to this protein family, by showing that Spict is an endosomal membrane protein that antagonises the BMP signaling pathway in neurons and S2 cells, causing internalisation of receptors from the cell surface to the endosome. The main goal of this project is to understand how Spict affects BMP signaling. Binding partners of Spict will be identified, and validated by biochemical and microscopic methods. Effects of manipulating binding partners, on localisation and trafficking of Spict and BMP receptors, will be tested. Trafficking pathways of Spict, BMP receptors and if possible of any novel binding partners, relative to other membrane-bound markers relevant to BMP signaling,, will be investigated, using both fixed and live preparations. Using these approaches we aim for a better understanding of the intracellular membrane trafficking pathways of BMP receptors. This will be important both for our basic biological knowledge of a pathway of wide important in development and neuronal function, and for understanding mechanisms of pathology that may be relevant to a range of motor neuron and axonal degenerative diseases.",1,1
171,216583,Yes,Stepping Up mRNA Mutanome Immunotherapy,"Immunotherapy is expected to fundamentally change the treatment of cancer patients. Personalized vaccines eliciting immune responses against individual cancer mutations have moved into the spotlight. We have pioneered the field and moved ´cancer mutanome vaccines´ from a mere vision into a disruptive medical concept compatible with current standards of drug development and health care practice. Solving key scientific and technological challenges and building on extensive preclinical studies, we showed in a first-in-human trial potent tumor-directed immunity in every single vaccinated patient, and clinical activity of a novel mRNA-based mutanome vaccine. Given that mutations are a hallmark of cancer, mRNA mutanome vaccines are universal drugs the efficacy of which are unaffected by the cancer type. The aim of this proposal is to ignite the next wave of advancement by addressing four key constraints challenging a full clinical realization of such vaccines. We will address the scarcity of point mutations in many tumors by extending neoepitope discovery to the full spectrum of genetic aberrations. Cancers are heterogeneous and outgrowth of clones unaccounted for by the vaccine is an efficient escape mechanism. We will develop neoepitope prediction algorithms deciphering clonal heterogeneity to inform rational vaccine design and countermeasures against selection of target escape variants. Tumor cell resistance to vaccine-induced T cells due to antigen presentation defects will be addressed by developing strategies for mobilizing the full repertoire of immune effector mechanisms, including antibodies and NK cells. T-cell exhaustion will be tackled by vaccination protocols promoting long-lived memory responses and by combination treatments counteracting tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Finally, we will drive the seamless clinical translation of the scientific findings by close interdisciplinary collaboration with strong and established clinical and industrial partners.",1,1
3,105361,Yes,A Multi-Stage Malaria Vaccine,"A highly effective malaria vaccine is a major goal of global health research and will likely require a multi-stage product. MultiMalVax will develop a highly effective multi-stage malaria vaccine to the point of proof-of-concept phase II testing in Europe, prior to trials in malaria-endemic areas. Remarkable recent advances in vaccine design for all four stages of the P. falciparum parasite’s life-cycle allow testing of a multi-stage multi-component vaccine for the first time, with strong chances of success. These advances are i) the availability of a new vectored prime-boost vaccination regime based on the ReiThera Srl's chimpanzee adenovirus technology that has been found to induce exceptionally potent CD8\ T cell responses and high titre antibodies against multiple malaria antigens; ii) the development of an improved version of the leading partially protective RTS,S sporozoite vaccine candidate, termed R21, that lacks the excess of HBsAg in RTS,S; iii) the identification, using a vector technology screen, of the blood-stage antigen RH5 as the first antigen to induce potent strain-transcending neutralisation of blood-stage parasites in in vitro growth inhibition assays; and iv) the demonstration that vector-induced antibodies against two mosquito-stage antigens can induce 100% transmission blocking against field isolates of P. falciparum in Africa. We will undertake four phase I / II clinical trials to assess the pre-erythrocytic, blood-stage and mosquito-stage components individually, and then together, using state-of-the art immunomonitoring, key functional assays of vaccine-induced immunogenicity, and sporozoite and blood-stage parasite challenges to measure efficacy prior to field testing. This SME-led collaboration of a leading SME, two universities, the major European product development partnership for malaria vaccines, and a global pharmaceutical company will provide complementary abilities to accelerate development of this promising product.",1,1
897,104,No,EUROPEAN PREVISIONAL MODEL BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM USING AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL DATA (P.M.D.A.),"Knowledge based support systems, to assist crop management decisions, are required to ensure that the treatments applied are economically advantageous and environmentally acceptable. The knowledge base may contain predictive models for various aspects of crop management such as crop growth, disease susceptibility, nutrient and irrigation requirements. Agrometerological data is an essential input to the knowledge base and there is a need to develop a standardized format for this that will allow interfacing with predictive models and farm management systems. Work is being done to select and integrate some well tested predictive models with agrometerological data networks to create interactive decision support systems for farm management.  Software is being developed for 3 crops, namely, wine graphs, apples and wheat that can be used to improve the accuracy of farmers' weather related decisions, in particular, the timing and frequency of chemical applications and irrigation. Formats of meterological data used in agrometerological networks have been collected and compared. A programme is being developed for transferring data from weather stations to microcomputers via telephone lines for storing the data in a structural query language (SQL) database. Predictive models have been surveyed for wine graphes, apples, wheat and irrigation and some of these are being adapted for implementation. These include models for evapotranspiration, water balance and plant development and models covering a range of vine diseases. In particular, the model of risk analysis for plasmopara viticola is being developed for the north of Italy. At present, wide scale implementation of P.M.D.A. is hindered by various causes.  For example insufficient established and adapted models, insufficient integration of previsional models with agrometeorological data networks and insufficient standardization of interfaces to agro meteo networks.  This situation calls for a well thought out intervention to coordinate model testing and implementation.    The tasks of project SYBIL are :    a) attain integration of well tested Previsional Models for wheat, wine, apple and models for irrigation into regional Agro-meteorological data networks within interactive Decision support systems for individual farm adapted crop management advice to fill the gap between models and networks;    b) establish a methodology for ensuring modularity, portability and extensibility to additional regions of P.M.D.A. by introducing uniform software engineering, including uniform choices for data structures, computer platform and user interface;    c) to disseminate validated P.M.D.A. addressing preeminent application - irrigation, fertilization, pest control - making them available for field testing and use by technicians in export regions with regional model adaption.",0,0
188,94188,Yes,Interferon-focused Innate Immunity Interactome and Inhibitome,"After a decade of development in model organisms and later in mammalian cells, mass spectrometry-based functional proteomics approaches have come of age and are ready to enable a systematic study of the innate immune system. We propose to cross the large-scale proteomics and innate immunity disciplines to obtain a functionally annotated map of the molecular machinery involved in viral recognition and leading to the hallmark interferon response, through a three-pronged approach: 1. Map the interactome of innate immunity proteins in macrophages to establish the network of components leading to interferon production; 2. Chart the interactions of molecular patterns, mostly nucleic acids, to identify the receptors and sensors at the non-self/self interface; 3. Study viral pathogenicity factors as molecular jammers of the anti-viral response and elucidate their mode of action to uncover critical nodes (inhibitome). Datasets are integrated and released at regular intervals with embargoed windows allowing a network of collaborators/own laboratory to do in-depth validation. New components at data intersections will be tested through loss-of-function experiments and standardized read-outs for the interferon pathway as well as genetic association with autoimmune diseases. Because of its unbiased/large scope and its cross-validating approaches, wherein the newly mapped circuitry is modeled, challenged by inducers and perturbed by viral agents, i-FIVE has the potential to promote a systems-level understanding of the interferon branch of molecular innate immunity. This insight may in turn create medical opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, septic shoc, arthritis as well as in boosting anti-viral responses.",1,1

Different items will be developed: natural sources and bioavailability of polyphenols, chemical and biochemical reactions cell regulation and disease epidemiological evidence of health effects. The best specialists in this research area are invited. The meeting received the agreement of SFRR European committee to be the annual meeting of the SFRR European Region. (SFRR: Society for free Radical Research). The objective of this meeting is to better understand which benefit for health people would obtain by consuming polyphenols in diet (vegetable, fruit, wine, tea).  The role of these compounds is still controversial and scientific evidence are required to establish nutritional recommendation in order to prevent diseases such as cancer, cadiovascular disease and neurovegetative disorders. In relation with aging; one of the major problems for food nutrients such as polyphenols is their absorption and bioavailability. Numerous studies are carried out to determine the molecular and cellular role on polyphenols as natural antioxydants. Epidemiological studies on polyphenol consumption and health effects suggest that high amount of polyphenols in the diet may lower the mortality from coronary heart disease although many data are still controvertial. This meeting will contribute on advances in the field of quality of life in relation with nutritional aspects. This meeting will contribute to improve our knowledge on the role of nutrients such as flavonoïds and polyphenols in health-care. It will favour the exchange of information between scientists and health professionals to develop a preventive medicine based on optimal intakes of antioxidants.

136,110207,Yes,CO-OPTION OF THE NKG2D LYMPHOCYTE RECEPTOR AS AN ONCOPROTEIN PROMOTING CANCER STEM CELL TRANSDIFFERENTIATION AND CANCER AUTONOMY,"The stimulatory NKG2D lymphocyte receptor expressed on natural killer cells and T cells and its tumor-associated ligands enable the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. This role of NKG2D is well recognized and efforts are underway to target NKG2D and its ligands for cancer therapy. However, cancers adopt diverse strategies to safeguard their survival. With advanced human cancers, NKG2D ligand expression favors tumor progression, which has been ascribed to ligand-induced immune evasion. In a surprising conceptual twist, Dr. Spies’ laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has found that cancer cells themselves express NKG2D together with its DAP10 signaling adaptor. Above-threshold expression of NKG2D–DAP10 in ligand-bearing tumor lines activates oncogenic signaling cascades and induces differentiation changes characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular reprogramming process that leads to increased cancer cell motility and metastatic dissemination. Intertwined with EMT is the generation of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are main culprits of failed cancer therapies. These findings challenge current concepts as cancer cells may co-opt NKG2D as an oncoprotein serving their own benefit.  In a preliminary assessment, this role is supported by significant correlations between proportions of cancer cells that are positive for surface NKG2D and criteria of tumor progression. This proposal seeks to establish that cancer cell NKG2D has a major role in the development of CSCs. The experimental approach involves tissue culture-based studies using model tumor cell lines and functional testing of patient-derived NKG2D bearing CSCs for their tumor forming capacity in a mouse model. The results may have profound biomedical implications by establishing a previously unrecognized mechanism that promotes tumor autonomy, and may impact translational approaches targeting NKG2D or its ligands for cancer therapy.",1,1
851,92815,No,"Investigation of the O2-dependent function of HELZ, an RNA helicase interacting with the oxygen-sensing prolyl-4-hydroxylase PHD2","A crucial step in the adaptation of mammalian cells to oxygen deficiency is the transcriptional activation of hypoxia-inducible genes. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are master regulators for the up-regulation of these genes under physiological as well as pathophysiological conditions, such as tumor development and metastasis, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. HIFs are O2-dependently hydroxylated at conserved prolyl residues by recently discovered prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs). Therefore, PHDs function as molecular oxygen sensors by determining the protein stability of HIFα subunits. Importantly, non-HIFα proteins have been reported to represent PHD hydroxylation substrates, indicating that O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation might be a more common post-translational modification than previously expected. The aim of this grant application is to study the function of the RNA helicase HELZ that was identified to interact with PHD2. HELZ has been shown to be important for the function of SMYD3, a histone lysine methyltransferase which has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Preliminary data demonstrate O2-dependent regulation of HELZ protein abundance and suggest that HELZ might be a novel PHD2 hydroxylation substrate. The goal is to generate a conditional HELZ gene targeting model to characterize the O2-dependent function of HELZ in vivo and to investigate PHD2-dependent HELZ protein hydroxylation by mass spectrometry.",1,0
565,24299,Yes,PANCREATIC ALPHA-AMYLASE,"In most European countries, the amylase test is the main enzymatic test in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease. Furthermore, it has been reported that elevated alpha-amylase in serum also occurs in mumps, renal disease and abdominal disorders such as cholecystitis. Usually total serum amylase activity is measured without discriminating the organ sources. Recently the use of inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies has enabled the pancreatic amylase to be specifically measured, enhancing the diagnostic value of the test. Measurement of amylase in serum is carried out in a majority of the European clinical chemistry laboratories (about 75 %).   The project aims at producing a preparation of purified alpha-amylase from human pancreatic tissue. The project will also include the study of assay methods to select that which should be used for assigning the value to the concentration of amylase in the enzyme material.   STATUS   Purified alpha-amylase was obtained from human pancreas. Two pilot batches (one liquid and one lyophilized) were prepared for an interlaboratory exercise -which gave good agreement- and a stability study, showing that the material is adequately stable. Results of this feasibility study have been published as report EUR 13629 (1991). A final lot is currently being lyophilized and certification is expected in 1992-1993.",1,1
30,3995,Yes,"ANTIOXIDANTS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND BREAST CANCER","The EURAMIC multi-center case-control study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that male myocardial infarction (MI) cases and female breast cancer (BC) cases have a lower antioxidant status than control subjects without these disease. Antioxidant status is assessed as the concentration of vitamin E and beta-carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails. The European study on antioxidants myocardial infarction and cancer of the breast (EURAMIC) multicentre case control study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that male myocardial infarction (MI) cases and female breast cancer (BC) cases have a lower antioxidant status than control subjects without these diseases. Antioxidant status is assessed as the concentration of vitamin E and beta carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails. Data collection ended 31 October 1992 for the MI study, and 31 December 1992 for the BC study. For the MI study biomarker data has been collected for 712 cases and 733 controls. For the BC study the number of cases and controls is 318 and 466 respectively. The distribution of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in the different centres has been analysed for 90% of the data. Classical risk factors like smoking, hypertension and diabetes are significantly more prevalent in the cases. Laboratory analysis of antioxidants has not yet been completed. Mean alpha tocopherol and beta carotene levels, as well as a risk estimate for low pressure levels have been produced for 40% of the data. Remarkable differences exist between centres, southern countries showing a relatively low beta carotene level, but also the variation within centres is large. Small numbers for some centres in the analysis do not permit any conclusions to be drawn so far. Estimates of the relative risk of MI at low antioxidant levels show an increased risk for low adipose tissue beta carotene, but none for alpha tocopherol. These findings need further exploration, including possible interactions. Results for selenium status for about 1200 subjects have been obtained recently and data analysis is in progress. Many studies have implicated free radical oxidative reactions in age-related disorders, such as cardiovascular and malignant disease. Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidative reactions by scavenging reactive oxygen-derived radicals and/or by interfering with the chain-reaction of peroxidation. Both vitamins (e.g., alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid) and enzyme-linked trace-elements (e.g., selenium, copper, zinc) are essential components of the antioxidant defense of the body. It is hypothesized that the risk of developing age-related diseases is influenced by the balance between oxidant stress and antioxidant defense. The fat-soluble antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene and the trace element selenium were investigated in the EURAMIC Study. These three substances may all be derived from usual dietary sources. Although the protective role of these substances has been studied separately in epidemiologic studies, their joint action over a wide range of dietary intake and antioxidant status is not well elaborated. As antioxidant requirements are related to fatty acid intake, especially of polyunsaturates, fatty acid composition is of additional interest.  Acute myocardial infarction and breast cancer have been selected as the diseases of interest. The sudden clinical occurrence of a first myocardial infarction and the diagnosis of breast cancer in an early stage, avoid secondary changes in life-style and exposure status. Acute myocardial infarction is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in men and postmenopausal women. In addition to increased disease risk from smoking, elevated serum cholesterol and blood-pressure, antioxidants may beneficially affect cardiovascular disease risk by reducing oxygen-induced damage to lipids, lipoproteins and endothelial tissue. Breast cancer is the most important cancer among European women. In addition to reproductive and hormonal factors, which do not lend themselves to preventive measures, dietary factors including the natural antioxidants may be involved. Antioxidants may prevent oxygen-related DNA-damage in ductal epithelium of the mammary gland.  For acute myocardial infarction and breast cancer, the following hypotheses were tested in the EURAMIC Study: 1 The concentration of alpha-tocopherol and beat-carotene in adipose tissue, and of selenium in toenails is lowered in cases as compared to healthy population controls. 2 The shape of the antioxidant-disease relationship is non-linear, i.e. the increased risk may be most pronounced at low antioxidant concentration. 3 The antioxidants affect disease-risk synergistically, in particular for alpha-tocopherol and selenium. Furthermore, the alleged protective effect of beta-carotene may be particularly important at low alpha-tocopherol/selenium status or in smokers experiencing high oxidant stress.",1,1
48,41663,Yes,Identification of new antigenic peptides recognized on human tumor cells by cytolytic t lymphocytes,"Research objectives and content  Several antigens have been identified that are recognized on human tumors by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). Many of these antigens are encoded by MAGE genes that are very selectively expressed by tumor cells. Therefore it is now reasonnable to try to immunize cancer patients against such tumor antigens to induce tumor rejection. Nevertheless, patients would be eligible for such immunotherapy only if their tumor cells express the relevant HLA molecule together with the gene coding for the antigenic peptide.  We intend to find new antigenic peptides encoded by the MAGE genes, in order to allow more patients to benefit from antitumor vaccines containing these antigens. Because some of these MAGE genes code for large proteins, we expect that some peptides corresponding to several regions of these proteins can combine with other HLA molecules to form antigens for anti-tumor CTL. A first strategy consists in searching the protein sequences for peptides containing HLA binding motifs, testing their binding in vitro to the relevant HLA molecule, and using the best candidates to stimulate T lymphocytes. An alternative method is to transfect dendritic cells or to load them with recombinant protein, and use these modified dendritic cells to induce primary antigen-specific CTL response in vitro. Advantages of this strategy include the covering of a complete protein with fewer experiments, and a more physiologic selection of the CTL epitopes by the antigen-presenting cells themselves. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The first objective of this training is learning techniques in molecular and cellular immunology in order to be able to identify potential tumor specific antigens. The Cellular Genetics Unit of the ICP have pioneered these techniques in the past and seems to me a very good place for postdoctoral training in tumor immunology. The development of efficient in vitro-priming protocols would be a new tool for many tumor models, and I will then be able to apply these techniques in other institutions. The possibility for me to pursue my postdoctoral position in the Cellular Genetics Unit will let me time enough to bring this project to issue and finally will offer me the best chances to get a position in a research institution like INSERM on my return to France.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  Recombinant proteins for several tumor antigens such as MAGE-3 will be used for in vitro loading of antigen-presenting cells. This recombinant protein will be produced within one year by the Smith Kline Corporation phamarceutical company. This protein will also be available for clinical trials organized in several european clinical centers.",1,1

In addition to these polypeptides, medina also encodes all the ribosomal and transfers RNA necessary for their intramitochondrial synthesis. Remarkably, although defects of medina cause a series of severely debilitating genetic disorders, our understanding of many of the fundamental processes involving the genetic expression of medina remains rudimentary.

724,201055,Yes,Elucidating the role of Arid1a in adult liver,"Liver cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in men and the eighth in women worldwide. Of note, liver cancer is tightly associated with tissue damage due to the high metabolic and drug detoxification activity of the liver. Increasing evidence demonstrates that toxic agents induce the activation of a resident ductal-progenitor population capable of regenerating the tissue. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms governing liver progenitor cells is essential for preventing tumour initiation and progression.  The aim of this proposal is elucidating the role of Arid1A (the DNA-binding subunit of the nucleosome-remodelling complex SWI/SNF) in adult liver progenitors by using novel 3D-organoid cultures, which allows long-term expansion of adult ductal-progenitors derived from the healthy liver. Moreover, genome-wide analysis and in vivo approaches will be implemented for accomplishing the goals of the project. Supporting a crucial role for Arid1a in liver progenitors, Arid1a expression is high in organoid cultures and is up-regulated in the adult liver upon damage as compared to the healthy liver. Importantly, Arid1a and other SWI/SNF subunits are mutated in liver cancer, suggesting that Arid1a and SWI/SNF exert a tumour suppression function. In line with this, our preliminary results indicate that depletion of Arid1a and SWI/SNF components increases organoid formation efficiency.  Overall, this research plan will shed light on the function of Arid1a and the SWI/SNF nucleosome-remodelling complex in adult liver progenitors and mouse liver regeneration, providing novel hints into their role in carcinogenesis.",1,1
20,88751,Yes,"Multiscale Micro-to-Macro Material and Structural Models for Aortic Heart Valves: Native, Porcine and Prosthetic Valves","Aortic valve (AV) disease expressed by tissue inflammation and calcification is one of the major causes for cardiac related illness and deaths in the world. Calcific stenosis leads to leaflet stiffening and abnormal AV mechanical-structural performance: larger deformation gradients and stresses. Current AV computational models are somewhat qualitative and do not capture the local complex nonlinear tissue and structural behaviors. Nonlinear multiscale (heterogeneous) material and structural (MMS) models have been developed and used in the analysis of many traditional and advanced engineering materials. These MMS modeling approaches can also be used for the analysis of biomaterials and bio-systems. New refined MMS models for the AV tissue will be developed at the microscale that can be integrated for the mechanical analysis of the AV structure at the macroscale. The overall goal is to introduce refined MMS for predictive simulations of native, porcine and a class of prosthetic AVs under in vitro pulsatile flow conditions. The proposed predictive modeling framework will be verified using sophisticated imagery measurements to examine the kinematics and deformations of both normal and stiffened (diseased) porcine AV systems. A major aspect of this proposal is to introduce new heterogeneous material models for the prosthetic and native leaflet tissue to be used in the AV-MMS simulations. The new modeling approach employs collagen fiber network (CFN) discrete multiscale model depicting the actual bundles of collagen fibers embedded in the leaflet. The in-situ elastin and collagen mechanical properties are explicitly recognized and a unit-cell (UC) micromechanical modeling approach is used to back-calculate (inverse problem) their properties from traditional tissue tensile tests. The proposed MMS is an important research tool towards imagery-based diagnostics of diseased native AV. This paradigm will also allow better design of new prosthetic AV systems.",1,1
952,195781,No,An astrochemical study of the early evolutionary stages of sub-stellar mass objects,"Astrochemistry is an inter-disciplinary field that provides an insight into the complex physical and chemical processes at play during the early evolutionary stages in star-formation. Over the last decade, while astrochemical studies have been conducted to understand the early evolutionary stages in high- and low-mass stars, similar work is essentially missing for the least massive stars, called brown dwarfs (BDs). BDs are ‘sub-stellar’ objects with insufficient mass to burn hydrogen in their cores and shine like stars, but are found as abundantly as Sun-like stars in star-forming regions, making them an equally vital constituent of our Galaxy. ABDES is an innovative inter-disciplinary project, which will deliver radically new advancements in our understanding of the astrochemical processes that occur during the early evolutionary stages in BD-formation. The objectives of ABDES are to characterize the physical and chemical structure of early-stage BDs, and study the fundamental role played by the accretion and outflow processes in shaping their evolution. With the advent of high-class telescopes and instruments with unparalleled sensitivities, it is now feasible to probe deep into the early evolutionary stages of BDs. To achieve these objectives, I have built the largest sample to date of early-stage BDs, using a new set of deep, high-sensitivity, multi-wavelength observations. ABDES will combine these observations with chemical/physical modelling techniques, and provide the first measurements on the astrochemical properties of early-stage BDs. Being an inter-disciplinary research division, the Centre for Astrochemical Studies at MPE, under the supervision of Prof. Caselli, is a great fit to this project, and provides excellent expertise and infrastructure for its successful implementation. ABDES is a pioneering study that will highlight the origins of the faintest stars in our Galaxy, and complete our understanding of star-formation toward the lowest mass end.",0,0

Electronics on the scale of atoms and molecules require fields that are able to trigger and to steer electrons at speeds comparable to their intrinsic dynamics, determined by the quantum mechanical laws. For the valence electrons of atoms and molecules, this motion is clocked in tens to thousands of attoseconds, (1 as =10-18 sec) implying the potential for executing basic electronic operations in the PHz regime and beyond. This is approximately ~1000000 times faster as compared to any contemporary technology.  To meet this challenging goal, this project will utilize conceptual and technological advances of attosecond science as its primary tools. First, pulses of light, the fields of which can be sculpted and characterized with attosecond accuracy, for triggering as well as for terminating the ultrafast electron motion in an atom or a molecule. Second, attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet, which can probe and frame-freeze the created electron motion, with unprecedented resolution, and determine the direction and the magnitude of the created currents.  This project will interrogate the limits of the fastest electronic motion that light fields can trigger as well as terminate, a few hundreds of attoseconds later, in an atom or a molecule. In this way it aims to explore new routes of atomic and molecular scale electronic switching at PHz frequencies.",0,0
896,88760,No,MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF THE REGULATION OF LXR ALPHA TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY BY ACETYLATION IN MACROPHAGES,"Liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha (a) and beta are nuclear receptors that act as metabolic sensors for cellular cholesterol. LXR agonists increase HDL cholesterol levels, have anti-inflammatory properties and improve insulin sensitivity. Therefore LXRs are now considered promising drug development targets for the management of human metabolic diseases. The search for LXR ligands void of their deleterious hyper-triglyceridemic actions has been traditionally based on their effects on receptor binding. We propose, as an alternative strategy, that regulation of post-translational modifications of LXR could be employed. My previous studies reveal that modulation of post-translational modifications of the receptor, such as phosphorylation, regulate LXRa actions in a gene-specific manner. Our preliminary studies indicate that, in addition to phosphorylation, LXRa is subject to acetylation and that treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, affects LXRa protein concentration. Thus we hypothesize that acetylation of the receptor could also affect the activity of LXRa in macrophages in a gene-selective fashion. In this proposal our main goals will be to: 1) Investigate the influence of LXRa acetylation on LXRa transcriptional activity and determine the mechanisms involved, 2) Elucidate the impact of phosphorylation and acetylation on LXRa protein stability, 3) Determine the crosstalk between phophorylation and acetylation of LXRa and 4) Identify and functionally characterize LXRa phosphorylation– and acetylation-modulated protein complexes employing a proteomic approach. In light of the pivotal role LXRa plays in cholesterol metabolism, identifying the role of acetylation in LXRa activity and the TSA-sensitive signaling pathways that acetylate LXRa is critical to our understanding of the different modes of action of these receptors. This could be exploited for the development of therapies against different metabolic diseases.",1,0
763,221508,No,Nanostructured Confined ABX3 Perovskite based Light-Emitting Devices,"The development of low-cost, clean, and scalable energy solutions is imperative to securing a peaceful and sustainable future. Optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) incorporating new, inexpensive materials show tremendous promise to alter the energy landscape by reducing the cost of energy consumption. However, the widespread adoption of LEDs demands new technologies to surpass the luminous efficacies of conventional LED light while having a full control over colour, brightness and directionality of the light source. Recently, a new class of semiconducting materials, ABX3 perovskites, is poised to revolutionise the LED field due to its ease of processing and outstanding electronic and optical properties. In this context, the ultimate goal of this proposal is the development of the first efficient white light LED based on luminescent nanostructured perovskites that feature tuneable on-demand emission properties. ConPLED will result in an alternative to commercial white LEDs, with the additional gain of having finely tuneable electroluminescence based on cost-effective materials processed at low temperature. The combination of perovskite nanocrystals that show quantum confinement effects with photonic nanostructures, an area where the researcher has demonstrated proficiency, will lead to fine control over the colour gamut, and the angular bandwidth of light emission. A deep understanding of the electro-optical and structural properties of such nanostructured emitting materials will lead to demonstrate efficient white light LEDs, which is one of the main activities of the Optoelectronics group at Cavendish Laboratory (University of Cambridge). The project covers the experimental realization of materials and their integration in devices as well as advanced characterization and performance tests, all of which lies in the common ground of physicists, chemists and technologists and, thus, will naturally broaden the area of expertise of the researcher.",0,0
944,203261,No,WADI,"The overall objective of WADI project is to contribute to the reduction of losses in water transmission systems and decrease the related energy consumption required for the process.  WADI aims to develop an airborne water leak detection surveillance service to provide water utilities with adequate information on leaks in water infrastructure outside urban areas, thus enabling the utility to promptly repair them.  The project idea relies on innovative concept of coupling optical remote sensing and their application on two complementary aerial platforms, i.e. manned and unmanned, typically used for distinctive purposes in infrastructure performance observation. The former is being used in long-distance monitoring whereas the latter in ‘particular’ areas observation, i.e. those with a limited/difficult physical access or requiring closer monitoring upon earlier detection of some anomalies in aircraft missions. Following the determination of cameras’ optimized wavelengths (suitable particularly for water leaks detection), the WADI technology will be applied in an operational environment represented by two pilot sites, i.e. in France (Provence region, case of water supply mains) and Portugal (Alqueva, case of multi-purpose mains serving irrigation, water supply, and hydro power).  The WADI proposal addresses the challenge of building a water (and energy) efficient and climate change resilient society by integrating the concept of ecosystem services through the recovery of up to 50% of the water lost at a cost which is lower by an order of magnitude than the cost of  terrestrial techniques – e.g. 50-200 EUR/km for airborne technology vs. 1,000-5,000 EUR/km for ground techniques. The project includes legal aspects assessment (related to data protection and regulatory standards for use of UAV), market analysis and strategy along with the corresponding business plan and a dissemination plan that addresses key stakeholders.",0,0
667,98580,Yes,Microbial recognition and adhesion on the nano scale using BIO-SPM,"Our main goal in this proposal is the elucidation of fundamental interaction processes between microbial systems and a living organism. This research will directly lead us to a so far missing understanding of the detailed mechanism of bacterial pathogen infection in vivo. The newly gained knowledge will be highly important for the development of antibacterial drugs against pathogen-related diseases and for the ultra-sensitive detection of pathogens using bio-sensors.  Bacteria have existed for several billion years by adapting to changes in their environment. Understanding how bacteria acquire new functions in response to environmental changes will advance our fundamental knowledge thereby enhancing our ability to design and tailor changes in biological structure. We will investigate local physical and biochemical variation in the bacterial outer membrane of live bacteria, at nanometer resolution, as bacteria interact with both abiotic and biotic surfaces.  For these studies we will use Escherichia coli (E. coli) primarily because it has been well studied and the genome sequence has been determined.  Biological scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is the tool of choice for these studies because it is the only instrument that allows studying living microbial organisms in their natural environment at the nano-meter scale resolution. A broad range of scanning microscopic techniques including Force spectroscopy, Topography and recognition imaging (TREC), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and Scanning microwave microscopy (SMM) will be utilized in these studies for looking into the dynamics of individual protein domains, local binding sites, and locations of charge centers of complex proteins at sub-nanometer, pico-Newton, and nano-Ampere resolution.",1,1
213,37587,Yes,Hiv nucleic acid vaccination - targeting of antigen presenting cells and induction of specific musocal and systemic immune responses,"The broad aims of this proposal are to develop an HIV nucleic acid-based mucosal vaccination strategy to facilitate the efficient development of a vaccine for AIDS. We propose to develop a well-characterised nonhuman primate model for mucosal HIV vaccine strategies. A principal goal will be to study antigen presenting cells (APC) involved in generating specific types of mucosal and systemic immune responses. This proposal aims to deliver nucleic acids (NA) via cutaneous and/or mucosal surfaces. This technology, combined with rodent and primates immunologic expertise coupled to the primate AIDS models, provides a critical competitive research resource for the development and evaluation of mucosal HIV-1 vaccines.  It is the aim to accelerate the preclinical understanding or development of: 1) processes involved in inducing mucosal immunity to HIV, including the understanding of APC-vaccine interactions. 2) new HIV-vaccine delivery systems for inducing mucosal immunity. 3) to develop a primate model system for the evaluation of mucosal DNA immunisation. 4) immune mechanisms of protection against mucosal exposure.  This knowledge will have spin offs and may enhance the development of European HIV-1 vaccine candidates as effective products to the clinic. This proposal combines a vaccine manufacturer, and adds complementary immunological knowledge from three different Universities with the pre-clinical AIDS vaccine development expertise of the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC). The primate facility and its experienced staff will utilise their unique primate resources in concert with these experts to facilitate vaccine development and immunological understanding of mechanisms of protective mucosal immunity. This is a new vaccine initiative which allows a methodical approach that will provide a better understanding of mucosal immunity in primates. This is of great importance for a systematic approach toward HIV vaccines designed to induce 'effective' mucosal immunity. In view of the predominantly mucosal route of entry of HIV and the distinct lymphocyte recirculation pattern for the mucosa, a basic understanding of this system and how it can be primed most efficiently is a pivotal point in the improvement of HIV vaccine strategies. APC will be targeted and their migration to draining lymph nodes, where they interact with specific B and T cells, will be studied in situ . Once targeting of specific APC is studied and migration of specific APC has been defined then HIV-1 immunogenicity studies will be performed in mice, and progress to monkeys. The immune responses which correlate with different APC targeting protocols will be assessed. Two well characterised model antigens which are in clinical trials (HIV-1 gp120 and HSV-2 gD ) will be used, in some cases together with SIV gag (for cases in which SHIV challenges will take place). Genetic constructs encoding the model antigens will be evaluated and compared for the humoral and cellular immune responses they induce mucosally as well as systemically. The accumulated knowledge will be applied to the last phase of the study which will involve a vaccine efficacy study in the rhesus monkey model, using HIV/SIV (SHIV) chimeras as challenge viruses. The last phase of the project will be undertaken to determine if the immune responses which correlate with the ability to protect from establishment of infection and/or disease.",1,1
727,31894,Yes,Clinical Pharmacology by Functional Imaging of D2-Receptors for Optimal Treatment of Schizophrenia,"To identify the receptors in brain which are targets for the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptic drugs. This information will be a cornerstone in future industrial antipsychotic drug development. To develop principles for more effective, safe and tolerable clinical antipsychotic drug treatment of the more than l million currently treated patients in Europe.  More than l million patients within the EU suffer from schizophrenia and are on long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs. The direct health care costs for schizophrenia are higher than 10 billion ECU's per year. Insufficient treatment response and intolerable side effects lead to relapse in psychosis and a chronic course. The industrial development of more effective drugs is hampered by the high costs. At least 150 million ECU's are required to develop a new antipsychotic. To improve clinical treatment and to speed up drug development it is of central importance to identify the targets for antipsychotic drug effects in the human brain. Research now benefits from the development of new imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). The sensitivity of these techniques is unsurpassed for direct studies on drug binding in the living human brain. High binding to receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine has been demonstrated by PET in large brain nuclei which are related to motor side effects. We have now developed the first method in the world that allows quantitative examination of dopamine receptor binding in the small limbic and cortical brain regions which are assumed to be 'sites' for the antipsychotic effect. To obtain the required number of patients three PET-centres will use the same strategy to examine patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Relationships will be examined among dose, drug concentration in plasma and degree of drug binding in brain. Principles will thereby be identified for optimal clinical treatment of schizophrenia. Biochemical targets for antipsychotic drug effects will be identified in distinct regions of the human brain . The new data can be used in industrial programs to tailor more selective, efficacious and tolerable drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia SPECT is a widespread technique with potential for routine clinical optimisation of treatment. To validate the SPECT-methodology a direct clinical comparison will be made between PET and SPECT.",1,1
674,74044,Yes,"Health benefits of exercise: identification of genes and signalling pathways involved in effects of exercise on insulin resistance, obesity and the metabolic syndrome","The European Union, like the rest of the world, is faced with an epidemic of the related chronic conditions, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Unless steps are taken to alleviate this crisis, the cost of treating the long-term consequences of these conditions could overwhelm our healthcare systems. Although genetic factors increase the risk of developing these conditions, their rapid current global rise must be due to environmental factors. Obesity and insulin resistance, both precursors of Type 2 diabetes, arise due to an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. This in turn may be due to two features of the modern urban lifestyle: (i) frequent consumption of processed foods with high energy and low fibre content; (ii) reduction in the amount of exercise taken due to changes in social and transport patterns. It is now well established that regular exercise, combined with an improved diet, provides protection against the development of these conditions, as well as a first line of treatment. The aim of the consortium is to provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, especially in terms of the signalling pathways and changes in gene expression, that provide these beneficial effects of exercise. Our consortium will address these questions using a range of multidisciplinary approaches including: (i) molecular and cell biology; (ii) studies of animal models; (iii) physiological studies in human volunteers of both genders; (iv) epidemiological and genetic studies of large human populations of both genders.  The consortium includes companies in the areas of food production, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, who will ensure rapid application of the findings made. Improved understanding of the molecular basis of the beneficial effects of exercise will yield applications not only in these industries, but will also provide a sounder theoretical basis for policies regarding promotion of good health.",1,1
102,226754,Yes,Oscillatory neural and autonomic correlates of social attunedness during early life: new mechanistic insights into how we learn to learn from one another,"We are a social species. Most infants, and young children, spend the majority of their early waking lives in the company of others. But, for practical reasons, almost everything that we know about how the brain subserves early attention and learning comes from studies that examined brain function in one individual at a time. This means that we understand lots about how children attend and learn from information presented while they are alone, viewing a computer screen - but little about how attention is shared between people during social interaction. ONASCA will develop new techniques to look, for the first time, at how two brains dynamically interact with one another during early learning exchanges. The project will determine how children’s active, participatory bids during learning lead to reactive changes in both members of the dyad – and how these changes, in turn, influence both partners’ subsequent attention, and learning. It will also determine how, and why, some infants, and some parents, show greater sensitivity during social exchanges than others. And, using targeted interventions, it will investigate whether social sensitivity can be improved. The question of how two brains dynamically influence one another during learning exchanges has been described as the ‘dark matter’ of social neuroscience. Yet nobody has looked at these questions before from the perspective of early learning. Our results may help us to move beyond viewing children primarily as passive recipients of information during learning exchanges, to a perspective that better appreciates children’s role as active participants in learning. Our findings may also have practical implications for educationalists, and clinicians.",1,1
225,102657,No,Modeling Milky Way History,"One of the biggest promises of astrophysics in the coming decades is to understand the history of our Galaxy and that of its immediate galactic vicinity. The European Union will play a key role in this effort through its cornerstone Gaia mission, which will map the Milky Way in unprecedented detail. Recovering the history of the Galaxy, however, will only be possible in concert with suitable theoretical models. We propose to carry out a research project at the University of Zurich, Institute for Theoretical Physics, in which we systematically explore effects vital for disk galaxy evolution - radial migration, substructure bombardment and gas accretion. These processes have always only been explored mostly in isolation from each other, and their combined effects on the evolution of a galactic disk are unknown. We will use proven state-of-the-art N-body \ hydrodynamics methods to explore for the first time the interdependence of these processes. The goals of the project are: to fully characterize disk evolution in the combined presence of disk dynamics and substructure bombardment; to produce observational tests relevant to the Gaia mission of different galactic evolutionary histories; to generate observational predictions of stellar diffusion, in order to provide a direct test of radial mixing in the Galaxy; to understand how cosmological gas-fueling influences disk growth. Beyond the scientific goals, the project aims to facilitate the researcher's return to Europe after a decade abroad. He will be involved in one of the largest research centers of its type, and given ample opportunity for collaboration with institutes across the EU, as well as teaching and technological training. The researcher will bring to the project his expertise in studying disk galaxy processes as well as current strong collaborative ties with U.S. institutions, thereby further solidifying the international cooperation between the U.S. and the EU in astrophysics research.",0,0
50,227451,Yes,Regulating Pathological Neural Connectivity in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and prevalent psychiatric illness that develops after exposure to a traumatic event, and involves symptoms of severe intrusive recollections and flashbacks related to the trauma, hyperarousal and reactivity, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood. Indeed, patients with PTSD are characterized by decreased prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulation on hyperactive emotion generation regions, such as the amygdala and brainstem. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback allows for brain regions to be self-regulated through neuroimaging signal feedback. Recently, the experienced researcher has shown that learning to decrease amygdala activation via real-time fMRI neurofeedback leads to a normalization of pathological neural circuitry maintaining PTSD, which was negatively correlated to symptoms. Critically, however, an intervention has not yet been developed to directly target suboptimal connectivity between emotion regulation regions (PFC) and emotion generation regions (amygdala and brainstem), where an urgent need for novel treatment interventions exists particularly among individuals suffering from PTSD. The objective of the current proposal is to determine the treatment efficacy of increasing the strength of connectivity from the PFC to the amygdala and brainstem via a real-time fMRI neurofeedback randomized clinical trial (RCT). Here, connectivity signals will be relayed back to the participant in the scanner as a simple thermometer that changes as directed connectivity between brain regions-of-interest fluctuate. Participants will be asked to self-regulate the neural signal displayed by the thermometer in real-time during PTSD emotion induction paradigms. The proposed study has the potential to develop into a novel treatment for PTSD, and is in line with current European research trends and societal needs to decrease the economic resources required to support mental health treatment.",1,1
415,13618,No,STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS IN ALLOSTERIC CARBAMOYLTRANSFERASES FROM MESOPHILES AND EXTREME THERMOPHILES,"Understanding at the molecular level the conformational transitions underlying catalysis and the transmission of regulatory signals in enzymes is a major goal in fundamental science whereas, in biotechnology, such knowledge is required to lay out the principles of a rational protein design. This question is investigated in a family of proteins, including enzymes from highly thermophilic bacteria, a potential source of thermostable biocatalysts.  The aim of the project was to characterize intrachain and interchain interactions involved in the regulatory behaviour of a model allosteric enzyme of known 3-dimensional structure: aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) of Escherichia coli, a protein consisting of distinct catalytic and regulatory subunits. ATCase catalyzes the carbamoylation of aspartate by carbamoylphosphate (CP). The enzyme is inhibited by cytosine triphosphate (CTP) and activated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It consists of 2 catalytic (C) trimers held together by 3 dimers of regulatory (R) subunit which is itself composed of an effector binding domain and a Zinc binding domain. CTP and ATP bind competitively to the same R site. Each R chain interacts with 2 C chains belonging to different C trimers, giving rise to the so-called R1-C1 and R1-C4 interfaces.  In order to investigate the interchain contacts involved in the cooperative interactions between the catalytic sites, a series of modified forms of the enzyme was prepared by site directed mutagenesis. The results obtained show that the R1-C4 interaction is essential for the establishment of the enzyme conformation having low affinity for aspartate (T state), and consequently for the existence of cooperactivity between the catalytic sites. From similar experiments, it appears that the contact between the carboxyl terminal region of the R chain and the 240s loop of the C chain (R1-C4 interaction) is essential for the transmission of the CTP regulatory signal. None of the modifications made in the R1-C4 interface altered the sensitivity of the enzyme to the activator ATP suggesting that the effect of this nucleotide involves the R1-C1 type of interface. These results are in agreement with the previously proposed interpretation that CTP and ATP do not simply act in inverse ways on the same equilibrium. The behaviour of a remarkable mutant with a single substitution at the interface between the 2 domains of the E chain, where the effect of ATP is reversed without affecting the CTP response, also supports this view.  Site directed mutagenesis was used to check the catalytic role of residue C his 134, which is in a position to interact with the carbonyl group of CP, and was a candidate for bearing a group whose deprotonation is involved in catalytic efficiency. The results establish that C his 134 is indeed the residue interacting with the carbonyl group of CP but that it is not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism.  Understanding at the molecular level the conformational transitions underlying catalysis and the transmission of regulatory signals in enzymes is a major goal in fundamental science whereas, in biotechnology, such knowledge is required to lay out the principles of a rational protein design. This question is investigated in a family of proteins, including enzymes from highly thermophilic bacteria, a potential source of thermostable biocatalysts.  The aim of the project was to determine the structure of a highly regulated carbamoyltransferase consisting of only 1 type of subunit, the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to identify residues and domains involved in the allosteric behaviour of this protein (Prof Haas, Zuerich).The catabolic OTCase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is unable to promote the anabolic reaction because of a pronounced sigmoidal carbamoylphosphate (CP) saturation curve and a high CP concentration for half maximal velocity. The structural basis for this kinetic specialisation was examined. THe OTCase lost most of its homotropic cooperativity and gained anabolic activity when residue glutamic acid (Glu) 106, near the CP binding site, was replaced by alanine (Ala) or glycine (Gly). When the corresponding Glu NH2 residue of Escherichia coli anabolic OTCase was exchanged for Glu, no cooperativity resulted, however. Thus, in catabolic OTCase other features in addition to Glu106 are important for sigmoidal CP saturation and such a sequence was identified in the carboxyl terminal part. Indeed when the 9 carboxyl terminal residues of catabolic OTCase were replaced, using an in vivo gene fusion technique, by the homologous 8 amino acids from anabolic E. coli OTcase, the homotropic cooperativity was markedly reduced. This gene fusion method should be generally useful for directed enzyme evolution.  Understanding the structure function relationships in this and other carbamoyltransferases requires 3-dimensional stru ctural determination. With this purpose in mind both the wild type and a muted form (without sigmoidal kinetics) of the enzyme were crystallised. 1 crystal form was used to solve the symmetry of the oligomer. Starting with the data collected on an area detector, a self rotation function was computed. This function shows clearly an assembly with cubic 23 (T) symmetry. Taking the molecular weight into account, the enzyme is therefore a dodecamer. A molecular model was constructed using molecular replacement methods. The model will be useful for solving the 3-dimensional structure of this and other carbamoyltransferases such as those from thermophilic bacteria.  Critical interchain and intrachain contacts involved inthe transmission of allosteric effects in Escherichia coli aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) have been identified. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP) have been shown to exert their effects by different pathways even though they bind to the same regulatory site. Progress has been made in understanding substrate binding. Critical residues and domains involved in the allosteric behaviour of Pseudomonas aeruginosa catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) have been identified. The enzyme (wild type and regulatory mutant form) has been crystallized and shown to be a dodecamer. An in vivo gene fusion technique has been devised to study directed enzyme evolution. The pathway of arginine biosynthesis in several thermophilic eubacteria and archaebacteria has been clarified. OTCases and ATCases have been purified and partially characterized from Thermus aquaticus, Thermotoga maritima, Sulfolobus solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus. Several instances of extreme heat stability (in particular in the presence of substrate and/or products) have been brought to light. The genes for Thermus aquaticus and Thermotoga maritima ATCases have been cloned.",0,0

860,81820,No,Identification and characterization of the factors involved in CYP3A4 inter-individual variability,"The molecular basis that makes a therapeutic drug become toxic has an enormous clinical relevance: it has been estimated that the fatal adverse drug reactions are between the 4th and 6th leading cause of death in developed countries. In addition, the lack of therapeutic effect of a drug by a deficient formation of the active metabolite or by its fast elimination can also lead to death.  The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are the most relevant enzymes catalysing the biotransformation of drugs, and many of the fatal adverse drug reactions, as well as a lack of therapeutic effect of drugs, are due to an abnormal CYP activity. In the human liver the most important enzyme catalysing the biotransformation of drugs is the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).  This CYP is involved in the metabolism of 50% of currently used therapeutic drugs. As a consequence, variations in CYP3A4 activity have a major impact on pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate of drugs, drug-drug interactions and toxicology. In the population there are great differences in CYP3A4 activity and the result is a great inter-individual variability in the susceptibility to toxics, optimal drug doses and adverse reactions.  Nowadays, CYP3A4 activity variability is unpredictable, since the molecular mechanisms responsible for it are still unknown. Several studies have shown that this variability is genetically determined, ruling out environmental factors. In this project we intend to identify the critical mechanisms regulating CYP3A4 expression and then investigate whether these mechanisms are susceptible of inter-individual variability.  In a first step, the obtained information (genetic markers) will be used in connection to cardiovascular diseases, trying to find an association between them and the pharmacological effect obtained with different drugs. Finally, we intent find a simple test, in connection with selected genetic markers, able to predict CYP3A4 activity.",1,0

552,221638,Yes,FundaMentalHM: Innovative methods for better estimation of Fundamental Health Metrics associated with Mental disorders and other general medical conditions,"The contribution of mental disorders to the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study is now well recognized – mental disorders account for 6.8% of the total burden worldwide. Because the GBD’s health metric Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) combines the impact of both morbidity (Years Lived with Disability; YLDs) and mortality (Years of Life Lost; YLLs), it has foregrounded the previously neglected contribution of mental disorders to the global disease burden. However, this health metric does not account for comorbidity adequately, which leads to an underestimation of excess morbidity and mortality associated with mental disorders. This bias has serious implications for service planning and resource allocation. The focus of FundaMentalHM is to use aggregated data from the GBD Study and register-based individual-level data from the whole Danish population to fill the existing methodological gaps, by developing and applying new methodologies in order to better estimate the burden of mental disorders. FundaMentalHM will (i) provide the most comprehensive detailed analysis of comorbidity between mental disorders and other general medical conditions, (ii) advance the area of science related to health metrics by incorporating dependent (instead of independent) comorbidity to the estimates, and (iii) use innovative methods to better estimate the excess mortality associated with mental disorders. In accomplishing FundaMentalHM’s objectives, I will provide a more accurate, unbiased view of the true burden – including true number of deaths – associated with mental disorders. These estimates are essential in order to guide the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, I expect that the suite of methods developed as part of FundaMentalHM project can be applied to a wide range of other disorders.",1,1

Their growth is characterised by infiltration of surrounding healthy tissue, rapid proliferation, and the formation of a necrotic core. GBM growth often creates biomechanical forces that cause compression and displacement of the surrounding brain tissue. This mass-effect is of direct clinical importance; it correlates to functional loss and pressure-induced brain herniation is the leading cause of death for 73% of patients, however this is not used to inform treament. Overall long term prognosis for GBM remains poor, with median overall-survival below 1.5 years and 5-y survival rates below 3%.  We hypothesize that  biomechanical Glioma “phenotypes” can be distinguished by mathematical models that estimate the forces that produce tissue displacement. Forces building up as a result of tumour growth might alter the behaviour of cancer cells and can reduce blood perfusion by compressing intra-tumoral blood vessels thus affecting drug delivery. We therefore expect that biomechanical factors may have direct implications not only on the biophysical level, but also for clinical decision making, affecting treatment response and outcome.  This project seeks to understand the role of biomechanics in the formation of different GBM phenotypes, and to identify “biomechanical markers” that can be used to inform clinical decision making for individual patients. A mathematical model of tumour growth and biomechanical tumour/healthy tissue interaction will be developed and characterised in a multi-step validation procedure. This model will be tested with clinical data and may allow for characterisation of the biomechanical fingerprint of individual patients. Its impact on treatment outcomes will be investigated in in silico studies with clinical data.",1,1
1056,188521,No,Vortex Robot for Rapid Low Cost Scanning and Improved Non-Destructive Testing of Large Concrete Structures,"Large public infrastructure facilities around the world like dams, cooling towers and bridges use cement as the main building material. Although made from a durable material many of these large assets have begun to age and are in need of periodic inspection to ensure their integrity. Current inspection routine involves setting up scaffolds that have to be moved around for personnel to reach to the whole of the surface. The VORTEXSCAN proposal seeks to develop a vortex robot that will autonomously navigate the vertical surfaces of such structures while deploying a combination of non destructive inspection techniques. Air suction through a nozzle of a specific geometry will create a vortex and initiate a force that attaches the robot to a vertical surface while its wheels move it around. Novel phased array Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) will be one of the two NDT equipment carried by the robot. Low frequency ultrasonics will also be deployed and an innovative fusion of data from the two techniques will be performed. The fusion will diminish the drawbacks of each technique and create an accurate representation of the underlying material and its defects. VORTEXSCAN will create a system that can rapidly and economically inspect large vertical concrete structures saving huge amounts currently spent during the manual periodic inspections. The system will target EUs electrical power industry structures such nuclear reactor containment, dams and cooling towers as a large number of these infrastructure types are beginning to age; some of them having been built nearly a century ago.",0,0
373,12985,No,THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELECTIVE OXIDATION CATALYSTS FOR THE CONVERSION OF METHANE TO METHANOL OR FORMALDEHYDE.,"THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL EFFICIENT CATALYSTS FOR THE SELECTIVE OXIDATION OF METHANE TO METHANOL OR FOLMADEHYDE.  The selective oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde over a series of supported molybdenum catalysts and vanadium catalysts has been investigated for a wide range of experimental conditions.  Silica supported molybdenum catalysts are suitable for the transformation of methane to formaldehyde at ambient pressure and at elevated pressure in the temperature range 500 to 600 C, but improved performance in terms of conversion of methane and selectivity to formaldehyde can be achieved by doping the catalysts with small amounts of sodium, copper or iron.  Formaldehyde is the only selective oxidation product observed at ambient pressure, but a mixture of this product and methanol forms at pressures of 5 bar and above. At ambient pressure, conversion of methane increases as the methane partial pressure is decreased but selectivity to formaldehyde is not affected. At higher pressures selectivity to methanol and formaldehyde is less but the total amount of methane consumed is greater. The performances of catalysts which show diminishing selectivity to methanol and/or formaldehyde for increasing methane consumption are compared at ambient pressure and at elevated pressure.  An infrared spectroscopic investigation of supported molybdenum catalysts revealed the presence of methoxy species and oxymethylene species on the catalyst surface, following exposure to methane in typical reaction conditions.  Research was carried out into development of selective oxidation catalysts for the transformation of methane to methanol or formaldehyde. Little was known concerning these reactions so that it was important to establish the extent to which the desired transformations could be achieved.  The factors which determine the propensity of the catalyst system to yield formaldehyde only, or a mixture of formaldehyde and methanol, as the selective oxidation product(s) have been established. The rates of formation and the gas phase pressures of formaldehyde or methanol produced compare with those produced in many conventional selective oxidation processes. However, yields appeared to be low because the system was operated in methane rich conditions (methane to nitrogen oxide ratio of 5 to 1) so that a small fraction only of the available methane was converted.  A general finding to emerge from the research was that most catalysts studied were sufficiently active in the experimental conditions employed to convert appreciable amounts of methane, but the best catalysts were those which did not lead to an excessive amount of formaldehyde decomposition in subsequent reactions. In general, it was necessary to add a dopant to the system to achieve reasonable activity and retain an acceptable selectivity. MOST OF THE WORLD PRODUCTION OF METHANOL IS AT PRESENT DERIVED FROM SYNTHESIS GAS. DIRECT CONVERSION OF METHANE ON MOO3/SIO2 CATALYSTS WITH GOOD SELECTIVITIES AT LOW CONVERSION RATES HAS RECENTLY BEEN REPORTED. THREE APPROACHES ARE ENVISAGED BY NIHE OF LIMERICK WITH A VIEW TO NEW CATALYSTS FORMULATIONS:      .- SCREENING OF A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL CATALYSTS FOR THE SELECTIVE OXIDATION OF C3 AND C4 HYDROCARBONS, MAINLY OF THE V, P OXIDES AND BI MOLYBDATE TYPE. THESE WILL BE SUITABLY MODIFIED BY ALTERING P/V AND BI/MO RATIOS TO CONFER THE DESIRED PROPERTIES;      .- PREPARING A NUMBER OF BIPHASIC MATERIALS CONSISTING OF AN OXIDE PHASE WITH STRONG LEWIS BASE CENTRES (WITH DEHYDROGENATING PROPERTIES), SUCH AS ZNO OR CUO, AND AN OXIDE, SUCH AS MOO3, CAPABLE OF ACTING AS RESERVOIR OF ATOMIC OXYGEN.      .- OBTAINING MEMBRANE CATALYSTS WITH A HIGH OXYGEN ION MOBILITY IN THE LATTICE. THE METHANE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH ONE SIDE OF THE MEMBRANE WILL REACT ONLY WITH THE OXYGEN DERIVED FROM THE LATTICE, THUS GIVING RISE TO SELECTIVE PRODUCTS. OXYGEN WILL BE PRESENT AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MEMBRANE. MOO3-DERIVED MATERIALS WILL BE INVESTIGATED FIRST. EACH TYPE OF CATALYST WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY MEANS OF A NUMBER OF MODERN TECHNIQUES.   TESTING IN A BATCH REACTOR (50 ATM.) AND IN A CONTINUOUS-FLOW REACTOR AT AMBIENT PRESSURE WILL ALSO BE CARRIED OUT. FT-IR AND MASS SPECTROMETRY IN D2 EXCHANGE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE USED TO STUDY THE INTERACTION BETWEEN METHANE AND THE CATALYST SURFACE.

The project revolves around cities in European history and identity. A huge quantity of fictional and non-fictional AV works (from the end of the 19th century onwards) in their collections describe cities in all aspects, including physical transformation and social dynamics. Such material could prove of enormous value to scholars in different fields of study. I-Media-Cities plans integration and technical development work to push interoperability among 9 archives and generate two types of e-environments to be used by researchers and innovators for research and other creative purposes. This will allow new approaches to research in social sciences and unleash creativity, in new forms of delivery and consumption of that content which the creative industry would be able to propose for instance in tourism or in the cultural economy. To make that possible, the project relies on collaboration among three main components: a) FHI (Film Holding Institutions); b) research institutions in different areas of social sciences; c) expertise in exploitation processes of digital content. At the end of the project, we will deliver a digital content access platform (interoperable and multilingual), made available to a growing community of researchers and creatives Europe-wide to push the boundaries of what we can learn, through AV material on cities, on European history and identity. The legacy of I-Media-Cities will be a new model for research on digital sources (applicable also to other subject areas), plus appropriate exploitation plans to consolidate and expand the platform into the European reference initiative on AV digital content.",0,0

SEE-LIGHT project is currently establishing dark-fibre backbone in the region, and SEE-GRID-SCI empowering strategic regional user communities in common use of the eInfrastructure. Close collaboration of National Research &amp; Education Networks and National Grid Initiatives in the region was crucial in materialising this vision. The above initiatives have also raised awareness of national ministries for the necessity of local programmes and financial support for eInfrastructures: a number of ministries have contributed to local network funding and regional interconnections, as well as national Grid programmes. SEERA-EI will capitalise on this momentum and link national-level programme managers and provide an open forum for information exchange, in order to enable coordination of national programmes in eInfrastructures, and to set the framework for a common regional agenda. The project will gather and exchange information regarding current programmes and carry out a state-of-the-art analysis; produce set of best practices and guidelines for national eInfrastructure programmes; and identify areas for joint regional activities, ranging from short-term soft actions, mid-term policy-level actions, to preparatory activities for long-term actions. SEERA-EI will reduce fragmentation of national programmes, create a harmonised approach to national-level initiatives in eInfrastructures, ensure local commitment, and pave the way towards common regional vision, strategy and sustainable cooperation which will give the region a common voice on European and international stage and strengthen the ERA as a whole, enabling collaborative high-quality research across a spectrum of scientific fields.",0,0

235,22088,No,High-Density IC Card,"The objective of the project is the development of a new generation of smart cards, which will combine high density non volatile memory technology with state of the art computer architectures and advanced security features, based on public key algorithms.  An innovative EEPROM memory cell will be developed, based on ST's current flash memory technology, which will offer a density 2/4 time better than current state-of-the-art EEPROM processes, while keeping the same low power dissipation. A programming time in the range of 1 ms and a cell size of about 12 micron{2} are targeted for the final technology implementation in 0.6 micron technology. Cell size will be compatible with the realisation of 1 Mb EEPROM embedded blocks.   The smartcard will present the following features:   - single power supply, down to less than 2.5 V  - very low power consumption sleep mode  - high-speed data rate (> 100 Kbit/s), achieved with the use of a SRAM buffer and parallel writing of NVM  - enhanced security features, based on a public key algorithm, with key length up to 1024 bit  - a coprocessor able to perform exponentiation in about 0.5sec, at a clock rate of 3.57 MHz  - small chip area (<15 mm{2}).   The new cell architecture will be first demonstrated in 0.8 micron technology on a 256 K stand-alone memory in the first year of the project. This memory will be used to qualify the memory cell technology and to identify all possible reliability hazards. A device shrink to 0.6 micron design rules will be made possible by the use of special 'shrinkable' rules in the first design phase.   Development of critical process steps and investigation on cell reliability and intrinsic cell security will be carried out in parallel, with the help of two research institutions (NMRC in Ireland and EPFL in Switzerland).   A new operating system will be developed to manage the large embedded memory and the more powerful security features, based on public key algorithm.   Prototyping of the 0.6 micron technology smartcard is scheduled for 1995, while full product validation is expected in 1996, at the end of the project. The project will include card fabrication, and validation of the full system on a typical application.   At present, a device with 64 Kbit of embedded EEPROM and a public key algorithm is foreseen as the demonstrator of the new smartcard technology.

It builds upon expertise developed in three previous cross-national projects concerned with the impact of intra-Community mobility on families and careers.  The proposal examines the issue of scientific mobility from Europe to the US in the political, legal and cultural context, considering formal barriers to mobility such as for example work permit, security check for scientists and their families. The project seeks to develop an understanding of the processes shaping scientific mobility both in terms of the pull factors - the attractiveness of the US and also the push factors - encouraging out-mobility and also restricting return. It aims at an understanding of the migration and career decisions of women and men in science.  The project demands careful attention to a wide range of variables including national and regional labour markets, higher education systems, cultural, social and personal/life-course factors set within the wider parameters of EU/international policy. It is based upon a combination of the following research methods: documentary and legal analysis, statistical analysis of available secondary data and detailed qualitative empirical work in the US, UK and Italy.  The inclusion of policy evaluation and in-depth qualitative work alongside other methods constitutes an important means of achieving the level of contextualisation necessary in comparative analysis.

383,212468,No,A disruptive innovation for the minisation of railway mantenance costs,"European rail infrastructure managers spend yearly over 869M€ (from public funds) in repairing railway track damages caused by the poor conditions of train wheels. The existence of wheel defects implies however other significant costs, such as those associated with delays caused by incidents (over 1M€ per year only in UK) and the important economic, material and potential human losses due to derailments (only those involving dangerous goods cost Europe over 200M€ per year). This is however not due to maintenance overlook of train operating companies, as they spend yearly around 2.293M€ in inspection, maintenance and renewal operations of wheels. This is rather because even small changes in wheel condition (not detectable by current technologies) lead to huge damages in railway infrastructure.  AMINSA has developed DTD SYSTEM, an innovative system capable of detecting with high precision wheel defects at its onset, using this information to design a predictive maintenance plan. DTD SYSTEM´s added value compared to competing systems is: 1) Higher accuracy in identifying wheel defects, 2) Reduction in track maintenance needs, 3) Easier and personalized service attending to each user’s needs, 4) Reduction in wheel inspection and maintenance and renewal costs.  The successful execution of Phase 1 has led to the definition of a business model to deploy DTD SYSTEM as a service and reach EU market, establishing strategic alliances with stakeholders, users as well as commercial suppliers. Our overall objective in Phase 2 is to implement advanced demonstration units of DTD SYSTEM in the most complex and demanding conditions, as well as develop the tools needed to introduce DTD SYSTEM in the railway market.  As a result, the exploitation of DTD SYSTEM will lead by the 5th year to cumulative sales of 21.5M€ and benefits of 13.6M€, while saving railway industry over 550M€ in track maintenance costs and 148M€ in inspection and maintenance cost.",0,0

262,46311,No,Improving text quality in two languages - the role of linguistic markers of text structure,"Research objectives and content  In the European community, communication by means of written texts is getting more and more complex, not in the least because the European and national governments are faced with citizens who speak many different languages, while foreign language knowledge and mastery is very often deficient, especially in writing. In this project we want to investigate how communication through expository texts may be improved by making its text structure explicit. We expect this to be important for mother tongue (L1) readers, but even more so for foreign language (L2) readers. To reach this goal, we will deal with theoretical as well as empirical investigation techniques both in (text) linguistics and psycholinguistics. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  (i) access to a vast corpus of analysed coherence examples, (ii) detailed exchange of Dutch and French corpus results in the area of causation. (iii) confrontation of different classification heuristics, (iv) benefit from the host group's expertise in the domain of causality on different levels of abstraction, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view, (v) introduction into the domain of text quality and evaluation.

109,22139,Yes,European study group on viral hepatitis,"The specific aims of this European concerted action were the following:  - to assess the natural course and outcomes of patients with chronic HBV infection.  - to construct prognostic indices of chronic hepatitis B aiming for rational application of therapeutical approaches, namely antiviral drugs and/or liver transplantation.  - to study viral antigen expression in liver and serum and relate it to markers of the specific and general immune response in the liver and blood.  - to perform meta-analysis on completed and ongoing clinical trials on antiviral treatment of chronic HBV infection.  - to construct prognostic indices for treatment-induced events in chronic HBV-infection.  - to determine the therapeutic gain in survival after liver transplantation for chronic viral hepatitis.  - to assess the efficacy of hepatitis B immunoglobulin in the prevention of recurrence of viral hepatitis after liver transplantation.  Viral hepatitis, in particular chronic viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, is an important health problem in Europe. In the high-endemic countries like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal there are at least 2.5 million virus carriers; in the low-endemic countries of North-Western Europe chronic viral hepatitis predominantly affects haemophiliacs, homosexuals and drug addicts, but 30 percent of virus carriers do not belong to specific risk groups.   Chronic viral hepatitis appears to run a variable natural course. Subjects from North and Central European countries usually become infected during adult life, often through sexual practice, have high levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and core protein (HBeAg) in the serum, and after a variable number of years clear HBeAg and HBV from the serum with remission of the inflammation of the liver. In Southern Europe, intrafamilial spread is common giving rise to infection early in life. Clearance of HBeAg occurs frequently, but HBV-replication with active liver disease can persist in antiHBe-positive patients. The existence of an emerging variant strain of the virus has been demonstrated. Moreover, hepatitis D virus (HDV) superinfection is particularly common in Southern Europe both in relation to intrafamiliar spread as well as to drug addiction. Conceivably, the ongoing pandemic of human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is spreading predominantly among homosexuals in North-Europe and among drug addicts in Southern countries, might modify the epidemiological, clinical and virologic patterns of the disease. The pathobiology of chronic viraemia is only partly understood and further study of immunology, environmental factors (lifestyle, virus-virus interaction) and molecular biology could elucidate why a small proportion of infected persons develop chronic viral hepatitis.   All types of chronic viral hepatitis are now amenable to treatment by antiviral agents or liver transplantation. Alpha-interferon is being tested widely and will be licensed in Europe. This treatment is costly and only effective in a minority of patients. Similarly, the very costly therapy of liver transplantation is increasingly applied to patients with liver failure due to chronic viral hepatitis, although the effectiveness of this treatment modality appears uncertain. The evaluation of the modification of the natural history by such treatments is impossible by the incomplete knowledge of the prognosis without treatment. Furthermore, indications for intervention should be based on both prognosis and the expected benefits of the treatment. Results of antiviral drugs and liver transplantation vary widely from centre to centre, probably related to different characteristics of the patients and variable modes of treatment. In order to restrict treatment to subgroups of patients with chronic viral hepatitis who are most likely to benefit from it, cooperative research in both assessing prognosis as well as benefits and risks of treatments is mandatory.   In addition to the studies on epidemiology, antiviral therapy and liver transplantation, the Eurohep programme includes a section on pathobiology aiming to diffuse standardized laboratory methodology for measurement of virus or virus antigens, and to facilitate basis research on blood or tissue samples from patients in the clinical research programmes.",1,1

The scientific goal of NANOHOST is the experimental and theoretical investigation of a number of functionalized carbon nanostructures, and in particular nanohorns, selected according to their properties and expected technological applicability for energy conversion systems. In the NANOHOST project, a substantial reinforcement of CNSLab is proposed in terms of i) recruitment of experienced researchers, including possible repatriation of nationals, ii) exchange of know-how and experience through research visits between staff of CNSLab and that of prominent collaborating teams as well as by interaction with other scientists in the context of conferences and meetings, iii) acquisition/upgrade of research equipment, which will enable CNSLab to remain at the forefront of this very competitive area internationally and iv) strengthening of the status of CNSLab, nationally and internationally, through the organization of an international conference, through the promotion and exchange of ideas and knowledge as well as knowledge sharing by other dissemination activities. Such activities will include a website creation and operation and publications as well as participation in international conferences and workshops, popularization activities and public lectures.

245,37418,No,EUROPEAN HARMONIZATION OF METHODS FOR RABBIT FEED EVALUATION,"The rabbit production in the EU (50.000 breeding units) show a deficit in the UE and is in active competition with east countries and China. As the feeding cost represent the two-third of the total cost, the optimisation of the feeding (feed quality and control of nutritive value) is a key-step to maintain the level of profitability of this production. The central objective of this UE concerted action is to harmonise and to improve the methods for evaluating compound feeds and raw materials used in rabbit nutrition. In addition, the project aims to conduct research for developing new methods for the prediction of the nutritive value of feeds, in order to replace in-vivo experiments and offer to professionals efficient routine methods. These objectives could only be achieved if a complete concertation and cooperation between the different research teams is obtained. Thus, a network structure is indispensable for such a project aiming to harmonise feed evaluation methods in the EU. In this way, from 1990, 6 European research teams 'ECRAN' (European Group on Rabbit Nutrition) decided to cooperate on a common research program aiming to study the rabbit nutrition, and in a first step the methodology of feed evaluation. EGRAN will be the basis of this concerted action project. The project is divided into 3 main inter-connected tasks (fig. A), and the total duration is five years. Task 1: Standardisation of in-vivo digestibility determination of compound feeds (STAND). The first aim is to harmonise, not only the in-vivo procedure, but also the whole analytical chain necessary to obtain precise digestibility measurements (sub-task 1.a: STANDIT). It is in continuation to a preliminary study on standardisation of in-vivo digestibility determination, performed between 1991 and 1994 by the EGRAN group. Harmonisation of chemical analyses is also a necessary step to improve the precision of prediction equations of feeds and feedstuffs based on chemical criteria (task 3). The second aim concern the improvement and the harmonisation of ileal digestibility procedures (sub-task 1.b: STANDIN) Task 2: Study of the nutritive value of raw materials (NWAR). Two aims are considered here. The first one concern the achievement of a database (FEDA) containing nutritive value of feedstuffs used in rabbit nutrition. The second one concern the proposition and the validation of methods for the in-vivo study of the nutritive value of feedstuffs (including the adoption of a common energetic system) and more especially those implicated in digestive associative effects (MEV). Task 3: Development and validation of prediction methods for the evaluation of compound feeds and feedstuffs (PREVAL). Three methodologies will be used, based on: near-infrared spectrophotometry, enzymatic and caecal incubation methods, chemical parameters (rasp. NIRS, SIMUL, PRECHEM). The aims are: - Development of new in-vitra evaluation methods based on previous preliminary studies performed by EGRAN members in the past three years: application of the NIRS methodology to rabbit feed and feedstuffs, simulation of the rabbit digestion using one-step or two step incubation methods. - Improvement of prediction equations using chemical parameters. The main results of the project will be the achievement of a synthetic book or handbook containing: European standardised invivo and in-vitro evaluation methods of the nutritive value of raw materials and compound feeds for the rabbit, European tables describing the nutritive value of raw materials. Additional results will be the constitution of an electronic database on feedstuffs nutritive value. Intermediate results will be: scientific publications and work progress reports. Economical benefit will be obtained through the optimisation of the feeding, the use of vegetal by-products and through a reduction of digestive diseases. The optimisation of the feed utilisation corresponds also to a reduction of the nitrogen and mineral output (faeces and urine) in the environment. Maintaining the rabbit breeding in the UE presents great Socioeconomical benefits, as rabbit is mainly produced in small scaled units (without specific conditions of implantation, climate etc..) thus sustaining an active rural tissue whatever the region.",0,0
153,214939,Yes,Studying brain representations as a distributed process: from neural code to behavior,"We know coffee not only by its taste, but also by its name and association with caffeine. How our brains enable this association between stimulus-aspects and guides our behavior accordingly (e.g. determining whether we should drink coffee or discuss it) is one of the core questions of cognitive neuroscience. Neuroimaging research of brain activity indeed confirm that the brain simultaneously processes stimuli across distributed areas, each selective for a specific stimulus aspect. However, the computational research of stimulus representations (how fine-grained activity patterns relate to specific stimuli), is currently constrained to the detailed inspection of isolated brain areas. The proposed project offers a new formalism and method that may link these two research streams, initiating the study of representations as a distributed neural process.  By combining the computational and experimental knowledge of the host with the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) expertise of the researcher, the proposed project aims to reveal: 1) what computational principle underlies representations of different stimulus-aspects across brain areas, 2) whether distributed representations can co-express to form an overall knowledge of a stimulus, and 3) what mechanism regulates the expression of representations to allow flexible behavior. These questions will be addressed by studying brain activity evoked by stimuli composed of multiple aspects (visual, phonetic, associative) and by drawing from fMRI, brain stimulation and computational methods. Hence, the proposed work will provide the researcher with diverse training-through-research and a platform for establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. Expected results may bridge between the two major streams of cognitive neuroimaging to form a new understanding of how neural computations underlie distributed cognitive processes, which in turn gives rise to complex human behavior.",0,1
219,87722,No,Intramolecular force mapping of enzymes in action: the role of strain in motor mechanisms,"A fundamental but unexplored problem in biology is whether and how enzymes use mechanical strain during their functioning. It is now evident that the knowledge of atomic structures and chemical interactions is not sufficient to understand the intricate mechanisms underlying enzyme specificity and efficiency. Several lines of evidence suggest that mechanical effects play crucial roles in enzyme activity. Therefore we aim to create detailed force maps that reveal how the intramolecular distribution of mechanical strains changes during the enzyme cycle and how these rearrangements drive the enzyme processes. The applicability of current nanotechniques for the investigation of this problem is limited because they do not allow simultaneous measurement of mechanical and enzymatic parameters. Thus we seek to open new avenues of research by developing site-specific sensors and passive or photoinducible molecular springs to measure force-dependent chemical/structural changes with high spatiotemporal resolution in myosin. Since force perturbations occur very rapidly, we are able to combine experimental studies with quasi-realistic in silico simulations to describe the physical background of enzyme function. We expect that our research will yield fundamental insights into the role of intramolecular strains in enzymes and thus greatly aid the design and control of enzyme processes (specificity, activity, regulation).

MAIA uses the System of Environmental Economic Accounting – Experimental Ecosystem Accounting  (SEEA-EEA) as the methodological basis for NCA. The SEEA EEA provides a consistent framework for analysing and storing information on ecosystem assets and flows of ecosystem services, in both physical and monetary units. The SEEA EEA follows a spatial approach, requiring extensive (spatial) data and models as inputs into the accounts.  In MAIA, a flexible approach will be followed, allowing for adaptation of the SEEA EEA framework to the conditions of individual EU countries. In particular, MAIA will: (i) assess policy priorities for accounting; (ii) test, pilot and mainstream NCA in 10 countries; (iii) test innovative approaches for NCA in the European context; and (iv) support NCA in the EU through various communication and dissemination activities including the development of guidelines, a web-based information system and other facilitating actions. MAIA will involve in-country work in Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain but there will be outreach to all EU member states through exchanging data, guidelines and experiences.   The MAIA consortium includes a balanced mix of partners with backgrounds in statistics, ecological modelling and environmental economics, including three statistical agencies. In addition, MAIA has 18 supporting partners including statistical and other government agencies in 10 countries. Institutes with more experience will mentor and assist those with less experience. MAIA partners are involved in a range of other initiatives such as the SEEA London Group, MAES, ESMERALDA and IPBES, and includes partners supporting KIP INCA, which will facilitate exchanging experiences. Overall coordination of MAIA is with Wageningen University.",0,0
706,200727,Yes,Holding hands: cell-cell junctions in breast cancer metastasis and resistance to therapy,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, resulting in as many as 500000 deaths per year worldwide. Patients with breast cancer die unequivocally because of the development of incurable distant metastases and not because of symptoms related to the primary site. Understanding the complex, yet fundamental mechanisms driving breast cancer metastasis is critical to develop therapies tailored to this disease.  The current understanding of how metastasis occurs is derived primarily from mouse models and largely dominated by the notion that single migratory cancer cells within the primary tumor can actively disseminate to distant sites and develop as metastatic deposits. Unexpectedly, our very recent study on patient blood samples has shown that cancer cell groupings, held together through strong cell-cell junctions, can break off the primary tumor and form a metastatic lesion up to 50 times more efficiently than single migratory cancer cells (Aceto et al, Cell, 2014). These findings lead to new open questions, yet highlight a previously unappreciated and targetable mechanism of cancer dissemination. Our preliminary data suggest that, among all types of cell-cell junctions, desmosomes and tight junctions are involved in this process, and therefore represent unprecedented options for developing a metastasis-tailored therapy for breast cancer. The two predominant goals of this proposal are: first, to define the role of specific desmosome (DSG2) and tight junction (CLDN3 and TJP2) components in the development of metastasis. Second, to address their involvement in cellular signaling and response to therapy. These studies will not only use our first-of-a-kind in vivo models developed from patients with breast cancer metastases, but also cross the boundaries between basic science and clinical applications. Our research has the long-term ambition to lead to a novel class of therapeutic agents tailored to block cell-cell junctions and prevent metastatic spread of cancer.",1,1
561,81898,Yes,Cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease,"The aim of CARDIOVASC is to provide training for early stage researchers in the specialized and highly competitive area of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) under the tutorial of highly experienced scientists in the field at the Centre for Cardiovascular Research (CCR), a multidisciplinary research and training facility at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.  Its research focus is to better understand the molecular mechanisms and the pathophysiology of CVD, the major cause of mortality in Europe, and to provide new strategies for the treatment of widespread diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart and renal failure.  Ultimate consequences of CVD are the damage of endorgans, e.g. the heart, kidney and the vascular wall itself. Research projects therefore apply systematic and hypothesis-driven approaches in molecular, cellular and physiological biology focusing on these organ systems.  A structured training programme with special emphasis on the integration of basic and clinical research i s provided to bundle and integrate these questions. This interdisciplinary programme brings together molecular biologists, biochemists, pharmacologists and physicians under one roof, the CCR.  Our objective is to train a new generation of scientists and clinicians with the capacity of working at the interface of genetics, developmental biology, physiology and human disease. Therefore scientists and physicians in the early stages of their careers will be educated by specialists of the different disciplines an d have the possibility of interacting across the traditional boundaries.  The training programme will be based upon three columns: - Personalized training guaranteed by a direct supervisor and a mentor, as well as the steering committee. - Instruments for structured training, e.g. seminars, lectures, workshops, meetings and e-cooperation. - Regular and interactive quality control of the fellows and the supervisors.",1,1
555,37482,Yes,Statistical methods and software tools for the genetic analysis of monogenic and multifactorial diseases,"- To develop parametric and non parametric methods of linkage analysis to handle more complex situations with the aim of elucidating the genetic mechanisms and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of multifactorial diseases.  - To develop faster computing algorithms to facilitate the rapid fine location of genes causing monogenic disorders and to accelerate analyses with the complex methods developed for the genetic analysis of multifactorial diseases.  - To validate the methods and algorithms through computer simulations.   - To implement these methods and algorithms in user-friendly computer programs to be ultimately merged into a unique modular package.  - To make these techniques and computer programs easily available to the scientific community.  Many disease genes have been identified via linkage analysis approaches which test for co-segregation within families of the disease trait with a random marker locus. At least 400 disease genes have been mapped by linkage approaches already, but the majority of these are genes for monogenic Mendelian diseases with simple patterns of inheritance. Now human geneticists are beginning to study the genetics of multifactorial diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and obesity. Multifactorial diseases are caused by multiple genes interacting with each other and with environmental factors. Identifying and characterising the genes involved in these disorders is a difficult task because it requires substantial resources including very large collections of family data, highly informative genetic markers which span the genome, and specifically developed statistical approaches which deal with multifactorial disease. As data sets on multifactorial disease have been generated, it has become clear that there is an urgent need for better methods and programs, which, for example, handle multilocus disease models, environmental effects, and covariates which may interact with the genetic factors. This project will meet this need via a European collaboration between three groups of statistical geneticists (Oxford, Paris, and Berlin), who will be aided by talented computer scientists and post-doctoral fellows. This collaboration will pursue the objectives described above.   Identification of genetic variants contributing to susceptibility to multifactorial diseases will have important consequences for public health, especially since multifactorial diseases are quite common in European countries. Many multifactorial diseases are degenerative and are becoming increasingly common as the European population ages. Greater understanding of the susceptibility genes will enable the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies as well as contribute to the knowledge of the aetiology of complex disease.",1,1
113,4108,Yes,The effects of selection on gene stability and transfer in populations of bacteria in soil,"The objectives are to determine the effects of selection on the stability of antibiotic resistance genes amongst populations of soil bacteria. Resistant phenotypes will be selected for in soil by addition of antibiotics and by their production in situ. Subsequent effects on gene stability and transfer will be determined for chromosomal, plasmid and phage borne genes. The role of natural or artificial selection in soil must be measured to accurately assess the fate of genes in the natural environment and evaluate any risks associated with new gene introductions. Enabling technology is being developed to study the process of selection in the soil within a realistic time scale. In order to carry out the study it was first necessary to obtain genetically marked Streptomycetes. Genes for antibiotic resistance to thiostrepton and neomycin were sought as these antibiotics had been selected for subsequent soil enrichments. The second objective was the development of a soil microcosm system which required the selection and characterization of soil at specified sites, and use of batch, fed-batch and continuous microcosms with methods for the extraction of bacteria and antibiotics from the soil. The characterization of selected soils, involved physical, chemical and biological study. The latter required assessment of indigenous resistance levels to thiostrepton and neomycin in streptomycete populations. Antibiotic extraction techniques were required for detection and identification of antibiotics produced in soil and added to soil. As the former was known to be very low, a high level of sensitivity was required. Cell extractions were required for monitoring both populations and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in soil. The aim here was to enable monitoring of cell replication during sporulation. Thus methods allowing differentiation of spores and vegetative cells were needed to determine if the fed-batch and continuous microcosms were allowing rounds of replication. Molecular methods were intended as a secondary source of information concerning the fate of introduced genes. In this case differential extraction of DNA from spores and vegetative cells was needed together with exploitation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to improve sensitivity for detection of genetic markers.  Transposons were found to be extremely unstable and an alternativ e strategy forchromsomal marking was developed. This involved the use of the plasmid series pGM (Muth et al 1989) which allow insertion of markers into the streptomycete chromosome as these plasmids act suicide vectors, unable to replicate at 35 C.  The development of a new soil model microcosm, the fed-batch system has been accomplished which allow continuous rounds of germination. This will provide a more accurate and realistic assessment of antibiotic resistance gene transfer and stability in soil. New methods for sensitive extraction and identification of antibiotics produced in, or added to soil have been developed.  The project is continuing. The survival and dissemination of genes in soil microbial populations may be influenced by their selective advantage. The project aims to investigate the ways in which selection might act for antibiotic resistance in soil bacteria using the genes for thiostrepton resistance (tsr) and aminoglycoside resistance (aph I, II, V). A number of aspects will be considered to determine how these genes might spread in soil populations and if indigenous resistance is affected by the selection pressure imposed. The three participating laboratories will investigate gene stability by introducing resistance genes on plasmids, transposons and within amplified sections of the chromosome. Parallel experiments involving continuous soil columns will be run to allow comparison between the different sources of the genes.   The mobility of tsr within populations of introduced and indigenous streptomycetes will be studied at all three laboratories while Tn5 (aph II) will be studied in marked plasmids and transposons. The aph II gene being selected for work with amplified sequences on the chromosome. The stability of genes aph I and II will also be investigated in pseudomonad populations introduced into soil. Selection for the genes will be simulated by the enrichment of soil with antibiotic solutions and by introduction of antibiotic-producing streptomycetes (in nutrient-enriched soil). Genes will be tracked by direct probing and PCR of soil DNA and by analysis of phenotype and genotype of soil isolates.   Our aim is to determine the following:   Can selection for antibiotic resistance genes occur in soil?  Genes thought to be lost, following die-off through death of unfit inoculants, can reappear with selection?  The location of the gene is important for stability and mobility, but to what extent does this matter after several generations in soil?",0,1
74,186474,Yes,Revealing the hidden secrets of the MEP pathway to engineer new bio-resources for humanity,"The recently-discovered methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway produces isoprenoids in plant plastids and most microorganisms. Its absence in animals makes it a promising target for antibiotic development. In addition, many isoprenoids have important industrial applications (pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, fuels, rubbers, etc.). In order to fully exploit this pathway as a drug target and successfully engineer isoprenoid bioproduction, we must understand its regulation. Emerging disciplines like systems biology, synthetic biology, and computational modelling offer powerful tools to address this problem. However, combined expertise in these disciplines is available in few places in the world.  The first objective is to study carbon flux through the MEP pathway using systems and synthetic biology. This will enable a detailed understanding of the complexity of regulation in the context of the whole metabolic network. Moreover, it will provide engineering targets to improve flux through the pathway (which thus far has met with little success). Targeted engineering will be linked to bio-production of carotenoids, essential isoprenoid nutrients associated with protection against chronic human diseases.  The second objective is to target deoxyxylulose reductase (DXR), a key enzyme that represents a species-specific variant pathway node. The metabolic conseqeunces of this variant node for pathway flux will be examined. Moreover, structural analysis will be used to develop DXR-specific drugs. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to a general decline in their efficacy, and availability of new antibiotics is desperately needed; this approach promises a route to powerful, species-specific antibiotics with fewer side-effects.  It is expected that this research will lead to the generation of fundamental knowledge about the MEP pathway regulation and antibiotic development. This will have wide-reaching applications in biotechnological production of isoprenoids and health.",1,1
659,91923,Yes,Significance of TDP-43 in the population in relation to dementia,"The incidence and prevalence of dementia is rising as the world-wide population ages. Determining biomarkers for the early detection of underlying biology that will predict dementia progression reliably or, the monitoring of biological processes once present to track progression and treatment is necessary. Furthermore, these biomarkers will aid in the differentiation of dementia from normal ageing and between its subtypes, and in the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic and treatment methods. The current study will be the first to assess a new protein-aggregating biomarker of dementia, TAR-DNA-binding-protein-43 (TDP-43), in a population-based sample. TDP-43 was implicated in the biology of dementia in 2006 however its relevance to the population is unknown. This study will assess the significance of TDP-43 in relation to dementia in a population sample of older people who have undergone brain donation. The sample (n=350) is from the European Clinicopathological Studies in Europe (EClipSE). Each participant has been tracked longitudinally for up to twenty years (dependent on date of death), with clinical (e.g., dementia and other diagnoses such as diabetes, cognition and psychological symptomatology) data available. The three study objectives are: • The determination of the prevalence of pathological TDP-43 expression in a population-based sample of older people as a whole and relative to dementia status. • The determination of the relationships between pathological TDP-43 expression and other neuropathological markers of dementia as well as longitudinal cognition and psychological symptomatology. • The development of clinical criteria which are sensitive and specific to the presence of pathological TDP-43 expression during life. These investigations will have significant implications for the diagnosis, management and treatment of dementia syndromes, with the aim of decreasing the social and economic costs of dementia.",1,1
253,194575,No,Negotiating early job-insecurity and labour market exclusion in Europe,"Through an innovative use of four key concepts (resilience, capability, active agency and negotiation) and primary data (life course interviews, vignette experiments), NEGOTIATE will deliver gender-sensitive comparative knowledge about consequences of early job insecurity. We move beyond the state-of-the-art by investigating the linkages across macro, meso and micro levels as mechanisms of early job insecurity. General labour market processes and a severe employment crisis currently define the macro level. The micro level is characterised by young people with unequal opportunities to influence individual job prospects. The organisation of meso level structures creates differential access to public and private support within and across countries. NEGOTIATE’s core question is how young people’s scope for agency interacts with different layers of structural conditions in a multi-level governance system. By actively involving national and European stakeholders – including young people – NEGOTIATE will contribute to policies that promote the employability of young Europeans, thus maximising societal and scientific impact. We will observe the present, learn from the past and project the future to inform policies that help prevent early labour market exclusion and adverse effects of job insecurity in the short and long term, thereby leading Europe closer to the Europe 2020 goals. A trans-disciplinary Consortium of nine research institutions – from BG, CZ, DE, EL, NO, PL, ES, CH, UK – and one international CSO will implement NEGOTIATE. The participating countries are differently affected by the economic crisis and display historical variations across key institutional factors, such as welfare state arrangements, employment relations and youth transition regimes. The participation of SOLIDAR will strengthen NEGOTIATE’s policy impact. Overall, the participants’ wide set of research skills enable a rich combination of advanced quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses.",0,0
308,52720,No,Development of new production techniques for highly efficient polymorphous solar cells ('H-ALPHA SOLAR'),"Objectives and problems to be solved: The general aim of the project consists in the development of industrially applicable production techniques for solar cells using polymorphous silicon with stable efficiencies above 10%, exploring in-line batch as well as continuous roll-to-roll techniques, aiming to ultimately obtain a system cost of 1 EUR/Watt-peak (1EUR/Wp). The module manufacturing cost reduction aimed at will be reached by simultaneously increasing the photovoltaic efficiency, improving the production yield, increasing the feedstock utilisation efficiency, and decreasing the cost of ownership by enhancing the growth rate. Description of the Work: In this project we will cover the two mainstreams of production technology: in-line batch processing and continuous roll-to-roll processing. On the one hand, the inline batch process allows for fast progress since the technology is mature. On the other hand, the continuous roll-to-roll process offers a perspective to dramatically reduced production costs, but it requires much more process development time. In both cases, the projected improvements will be obtained in existing deposition hardware, where only the operational protocols and the configuration will be modified. Applying robust plasma process monitors, which will be developed and calibrated during the project, will control this modification. The work will be divided in 6 work packages. Their titles are. Materials and devices (optimisation)2. Process monitor (for control and quality assessment during production)3. Batch pilot line (The present technology: high-quality low-throughput)4. Continuous pilot line (Future technology: high-throughput)5. Assessment (of industrial perspectives)6. Coordination Expected Results and Exploitation Plans: The take-off of the photovoltaic solar energy requires to broaden the accessible market base in the competition with other sources of electrical energy. This can only be achieved by a significant reduction of the cost/Wp of photovoltaic solar modules and by the development of thin film solar cell technologies. The effort has to be placed at three levels : increased conversion efficiency per unit area, lower manufacturing cost per unit area, and economy of scale by mass-production experience. The present project is in line with these three issues. By using polymorphous Si thin films instead of standard a-Sigh films, the long-lasting problem of the low stabilized efficiency of a-Sigh based solar cells could be overcome without increasing the complexity and cost of the device structure. Therefore, lowering of solar cell manufacturing costs and reaching economy of scales in mass production are possible by a strategy of reduction of the cost of ownership of the PECVD equipment, which can also have advantages for TFT-Displays technology. The project partners will be the first to exploit the results. The focus of the exploitation and dissemination will be in Europe.",0,0
46,98849,Yes,Towards targeting chemokine receptors CCR7 and CCRL1 to control the crossroads of tumor-host interactions,"'Current immunotherapeutic strategies to combat cancer are hampered by the ability of tumors to escape immunity necessitating new mechanistic insights into underlying molecular and cellular processes. Through orchestrating complex cellular moves and determining the positioning of immune cells, chemokines govern both productive immune responses and their silencing. Chemokines signal through classical G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) but also bind atypical receptors (ACRs). ACRs modulate chemokine availability and create functional chemokine patterns by either degrading or transporting them. Besides their essential role in tumor immunity, GPCRs can be expressed by the tumor cells themselves and contribute to the formation of metastases, a major cause of death in cancer. Importantly, ACRs are also expressed in tumors but their role in tumor-host interactions is not clear.  The aim of this project is to take a comprehensive look at the contribution to tumor-host interactions of a paradigmatic chemokine axis with pleiotropic involvement in induction and suppression of immunity and driving tumor metastasis. We will investigate the roles of CCL19 and CCL21, their GPCR, CCR7, and ACR, CCRL1, in regulating tumor progression and orchestrating anti-tumor immunity and its suppression, including in the setting of experimental tumor immunotherapy. The proposed work will entail studies of transplanted murine tumors with hosts and tumors having modified expression levels of chemokines, their GPCR and ACR as well as using models with disrupted function of specific immune cells. The host provides state of the art facilities and profound immunological expertise, whereas the applicant brings complementary competence in molecular biology and cancer and will be able to synergize in order to reach the research objectives. This work should lead to a better understanding of chemokine-driven tumor-host homeostasis and suggest novel ways to treat cancer and promote anti-tumor immunity.'",1,1
464,6714,No,ADVANCED BUILDING MATERIALS OBTAINED BY RECYCLING TOXIC WASTES AND FLY ASHES,"A pilot production of aggregates starting from powdered mixtures of waste materials was essentially carried out by a process of mixing/grinding, granulation/drying and sintering at 1100ö1200 C.   The equipment for the granulating/drying phase was designed and assembled on purpose. It is a two-step, continuous-line unit composed of a turbo-agglomerator and a turbo-dryer with a co-axial thermic jacket for indirect heating through a cylindrical reactor wall and a thermic-oil exchanger for air heating.   The selection of a technology for the thermal treatment of aggregates was addressed towards a multi-step rotary kiln. This technology is believed to be the most appropriate for an innovative process, thanks to a higher output allowed by the last generation of rotary kilns, an increased operational reliability and an improved accuracy in process control. The pilot sintering equipment was assembled starting from an existing kiln, to which additions and modifications were applied according to the engineering study. It is a rotary kiln composed of a pre-heating/firing section powered by a natural gas burner, and a cooling/heat-recovery section. Construction industry components having better thermal and sound insulation properties, and improved mechanical characteristics and lifetime can be obtained using new secondary materials, derived from the recycling of industrial wastes (steel industry flue dusts and fly ashes coming from coal or urban wast combustion). These wastes are thermally treated to obtain granular aggregates, completely inert in acid and basic environment. A laboratory phase finalized to optimize sample composition and process parameters, will be followed by a technological phase where industrial tests of the process will be carried out, and will abut in an industrial applicability phase aimed at evaluating the technical and economic advantages of the proposed final products, and of the process indutrialization.",0,0
974,42320,No,Combined high-precision torque magnetometry and structural studies of high-tc and other superconductors,"The physics of vortices in the high temperature superconductors continues to attract attention, and is of theoretical and technological interest. Their complex defect structures influence the different vortex phases, and it remains an experimental challenge to correlate structural observations with those of magnetization. The project will study thermally activated and quantum creep, focusing on different structural influences. A newly developed high-precision torque magnetometer will be utilised, while structural characterisation will be undertaken with CEA Saclay. Quantum creep will be studied as a function of field and defects in heavy ion irradiated single crystals. Different types of pinning will also be investigated in chemically doped samples.  The high-field quantum creep regime will be investigated, in organic superconductors, to distinguish between 'bundle flow' and 'plastic flow' The vortex dynamics of heavy fermion superconductors, which have transitions below 1K, have never been carefully investigated, and the project will be extended to these.  The project will provide an important link between structure, the pinning, and the vortex dynamics in the quantum regime, and extend the range of this new field of physics.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The training will be in torque and magnetisation techniques, as well as furthering my already comsiderable experience of structural studies, equiping me with a rare combination of skills in two powerfully complementary areas.",0,0

A representative YAC library for P. vivax will be constructed. The DNA material will be obtained from patients and from primates infected with an Indian isolate of P. vivax.   * Assortment of P. vivax YAC clones into chromosomal contig maps. Chromosomal YAC contig maps will be generated using a 'top down' approach based on advanced filter hybridization strategies. YAC filters will be screened with random cDNA clones from P. vivax.  * Isolation of P. vivax var genes. The UNIEBP primers developed to amplify P. falciparum var genes will be used to identify and clone homologous genes from P. vivax. The production of full-length gene sequences from P. vivax will be useful for comparison to the P. falciparum var genes, particularly for functional comparison as it is believed that P. vivax-infected erythrocytes do not adhere to host endothelium.  * Production of a 3D7 clone tree and cloning of expressed var genes. To study the mechanism of var gene switching in P. falciparum, a clone tree from the P. falciparum isolate 3D7 will be generated by limiting dilution. The resulting clones will be analyzed for antigenic similarity using the mixed agglutination reaction with hyperimmune sera. Using RT-PCR, the expressed var gene will be identified and sequenced. The sequence will be correlated with the adhesive properties of this variant.  * Mapping a rosetting locus in P. falciparum. Using the existing progeny from the genetic cross between the rosetting clone Dd2 and the non-rosetting clone HB3 we will follow the segregation of the rosetting phenotype in this cross and determine a candidate locus. This candidate locus will be screened for the possible expression of var genes, to explore the possibility that rossetting is mediated by a particular var gene variant.  * Genomic analysis of var genes. Using existing, and yet to be constructed, YAC contig maps of P. falciparum and P. vivax chromosomes, the genomic location and organization of the var gene family will be studied in both P. vivax and P. falciparum.  * Analysis of var genes in field samples (P. vivax and P. falciparum). To determine the degree of var gene variability in field populations, longitudinal studies will be carried out in Brazil and India. The expressed var gene variants will be determined by RT/PCR amplification using the UNIEBP oligonucleotides as primers. The resulting fragments will be cloned and sequenced. This will generate a data set of expressed var genes within given spatial and temporal locations.",1,1
912,187004,No,Multi-Robot Systems,"The study of multi-robot systems originated from work on distributed robotics in the 1980s and has since promised powerful applications that still have to come to their full realization. The impact that even current technology applied as a multi-robot system can have is aptly demonstrated by the innovations pushed forward by Kiva Systems. These are revolutionizing the automation of warehouses across the U.S. and were acquired by Amazon.com for $775M. This example merely scratches the surface of what is possible with multi-robot systems whose study greatly benefits from a rigorous interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of robotics, control theory, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction.  The overarching objective of the proposed work is to provide a scientific and practical foundation for the design of multi-robot systems through an application-centric and interdisciplinary approach. The chosen application domains are search and logistics and contributions include the design of models, formal analysis, design and implementation of algorithms, as well as building, testing, and evaluating real systems with human operators. Innovations include multi-objective optimization for adaptive multi-robot coordination in complex environments and the application of crowd-sourcing in combination with cognitive modeling to multi-robot systems.

17,106047,Yes,Targeting macrophage CD163 for treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,"'Macrophages play a key role in inflammatory diseases. One of the goals of the TROJA ERC program has been to explore drug targeting via the haemoglobin scavenger receptor CD163, which has a high and exclusive expression in macrophages.  We have now developed new biodegradable anti-CD163 antibody-drug conjugates by linking drugs directly to anti-CD163 antibody and by encapsulating drugs in liposomes with anti-CD163 antibodies linked to the surface. The CD163-targeting technology has been proven in in vitro and in vivo models. A very promising line of results show that we by use of this technology in a rat inflammation model can show a fifty-fold increase in the potency of synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone). At the same time we observe virtually no systemic effects, which are known to cause the serious glucocorticoids side effects such as bone mobilization, muscle mass loss, infections and metabolic alterations. We now want to investigate the effect of CD163-targeted glucocorticoid in a major inflammatory liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common, often “silent” disease but anyway a major treat against general health.  A fatty liver is an important pathogenic factor in line with the fact that the steady increase in incidence of the disease correlates with changes in life style and obesity. The full-blown NASH with macrophage-driven inflammation and damage of liver tissue is a serious a condition with the risk of lethal liver cirrhosis. There is no current medical treatment of the condition The present approach of targeting the liver macrophages with 'safe' glucocorticoid may effectively dampen the acute inflammation and reduce mortality. The TROJA team expects to have PoC in the NASH indication within 12 month whereafter the project can be taken over by an industrial partner for completion of preclinical validation to obtain approval for clinical testing.'",1,1

However, the species of this family are notoriously difficult to identify because of the great variability within the species and the ease with which they hybridise. At present there is no univ ersally accepted classification of Salicaceae s.str.  The project will characterise both genera, Salix L. and Populus L., of Salicaceae s.str. comprising about 620 species worldwide. It will result in the creation of a comprehensive database of characters, taxonomically validated names, synonyms, bibliographic details, geographical distribution, illustrations and taxonomic comments. On the basis of this database, a checklist will be created and published as a book and on the Internet. An interactive key will also be made available on the Internet. Using the collected morphological data, a worldwide classification system will be constructed, for the first time, for these two genera.  This classification will be combined with the results of a molecular genetic analysis of the species using both plastid and nuclear genetic markers, which will also establish phylogenetic relationships within these two genera. In doing so, DNA from species acquired from the field and from contacts and herbaria around the world, will be added to the DNA bank at the host institution. The project will combine one of the most experienced systematic botanists specialising in the family Salicaceae s.str. with one of the foremost botanical collections and laboratories in the world, to create a definitive classification of an economically important group of plants.

Hundreds of thousands of nodes based on them will constitute the future exascale systems.<br/>TEXT is centered on the vision that the key component to support high productivity and efficient use of a system is the programming model, and we defend that MPI/SMPSs is a hybrid approach that can today be demonstrated and show the way to follow on the path to exascale. The SMPSs model provides the necessary support for asynchrony and heterogeneity as well as enabling incremental parallelization, modularity and portability of applications. By integrating it within MPI we can propagate its characteristics to the global application level. This is also a way to leverage and provide a smooth migration path for the huge number of applications today written in MPI.<br/>The focus of the TEXT project is to install the MPI/SMPSs environment at several HPC facilities of partners and demonstrate how seven real and relevant applications/libraries can be improved using it. The codes fall in the areas of basic linear algebra libraries, geophysics, plasma physics, engineering and molecular dynamics. They have been selected considering  the impact in their respective scientific communities.<br/>We will actually validate our claim by evaluating the ported applications with different end users and collect their feedback to further improve the technology. We will also promote the use of the model to other application developers beyond what is feasible to integrate as committed project partners.<br/>In order to exploit the opportunity window and really achieve global impact the project proposal is for 2 years. The TEXT proposal is composed of three networking activities, three service activities and two joint research activities.",0,0
396,199873,No,Robotics Coordination Action for Europe Two,"The FP7 coordination action RockEU has been extremely successful in building a strong European robotics community, leading to the creation of euRobotics aisbl - the private partner of the SPARC PPP and development of the Strategic Research Agenda and the Multi-Annual Roadmap, which are the main guidelines for shaping European robotics R&D&I.   RockEU2 builds on and extends this successful community integration by providing analysis of innovation and skills and by developing major outreach activities. This extension is achieved by intensifying and strengthening collaboration within the community and by taking a leading role in the development of strategy. This includes activities in market observation, technology watch, innovation support, analysis of funded proposals, regulations assessment, and standardisation support.  RockEU2 aims to Intensifying cooperation with international funding agencies (e.g. for joint calls), policy makers, and end-users as key enablers in the R&D&I process that contribute to the outreach and innovation themes.   Outreach to the cognitive science community is another key part of this proposal. Improving the uptake of cognitive science’s results by the robotics community is an important target, leading to more innovative robotics products and applications, boosting innovation.  Integration of activities started by the FP7-funded CAs euRathlon and RoCKIn on using robot competitions to foster research and innovation has great potential for improved public awareness of European robotics. Participation in robot competitions is attractive for young researchers and develops excellent engineering skills.

The project will demonstrate a number of ITS applications provided in different demonstration sites across Europe on the basis of technology developed in DIAMOND (IST-1999-11161), supporting the use of DAB and the service providers interested in utilising DAB for ITS services. Key actors in ITS and DAB have collaborated (vehicle manufacturers, terminal manufacturers, service providers, network operators, various public broadcasters and others) to create this European project for realising the opportunities. Demonstration sites are at Hannover (EXPO2000), Paris, Turin (ITS World Congress 2000) and south Germany (centred on Munich).  Objectives: Demonstrate the services specified and developed in IST-1999-71161 The improved DAB-based ITS services will be tested at four demonstration sites: Hanover, Paris, Turin and South Germany. The aims of these Demonstration sites are: - to act as a proving ground for the overall concepts and to provide the other sites with valuable information for fine-tuning their activities - early demonstration site at Hanover - to ensure that the data is relevant at the European level and that different modes of transport (road, rail, bus, tram, metro, air), different services and applications, and different operational cultures can be incorporated a number of main Demonstration sites in Paris, South Germany, Hanover again and Turin that provide comparable data but with specific differences - to provide publicity for the concepts at the highest and widest levels - a showcase demonstration site (Turin).

716,211798,Yes,Networking and Care: Helping young people with mental health problems through outreach and eHealth,"The aim of this project is to develop a mobile app which facilitates access to mental health services and treatments for young people with mental health problems; and to assess its feasibility, acceptability and potential clinical and cost-effectiveness. If successful, the app would: (1) increase access to mental health care by providing links to relevant existing services; (2) increase access to relevant evidence-based mobile health interventions and to address barriers to care and (3) allow individuals to review services they have used and provide feedback which can be accessed by other app users.  Insufficient awareness of available services and treatments and how to access them, and the stigma associated with using treatment, are two of the most significant barriers to mental health care for young people. As part of the ongoing ERC  APPLAUSE project, we have already collected data from a prospective community cohort of young people and found that among those with mental health problems, 40% wanted help but were not aware of how to get it. Thus, despite perceived need, many young people fail to find support.  The ERC APPLAUSE project cohort provides us with a unique opportunity to understand how and whether the app can change service use patterns. We will randomise cohort participants with mental health problems to intervention and control conditions in order to understand changes in service use in addition to estimating short- and long-term economic impacts associated with the app intervention.  Treatment can enormously improve outcomes for young people with mental health problems. Mental health problems experienced by young people can have many and often serious adverse effects, both early on and across the life-course. This app could help improve access to intervention and support, and hence alter developmental trajectories in a way that could improve the lives of these individuals and generate immediate as well as longer-term societal and economic benefits.",1,1
909,103747,No,Geo-acoustic mapping of benthic habitat distribution,"'It is widely recognized that important efforts must be done towards the protection and preservation of the Deep-Sea environments, which are increasingly threatened by human impacts (e.g.: trawl fishing and marine pollution). These efforts imply a further knowledge of the spatial organization of benthic communities in Deep-Sea and an implementation of efficient and cost-saving mapping methods. GEO-HABIT is a multidisciplinary project that will focus on a holistic study of the relationship between seafloor geology and biodiversity patterns. Important insights are expected on the role that physical elements play in the distribution of Deep-Sea habitats and in the development of an integrated and nested-scale method to map them. Data mainly consist of geo-acoustic data (high-resolution Multibeam bathymetry and Sidescan Sonar), HD videos from ROV (Victor6000-IFREMER) and Manned-Submersible (Jago-GEOMAR) and rock/sediment seafloor samples. The study will focus on geomorphic features (Submarine canyons, Seamounts) which are benthic ecosystem hot-spots due to their specific environmental settings and which, according to the European Community, potentially deserve site protection (European Habitats Directive), thus indicating the timeliness and relevance of the project. With the support of researchers from NOC (National Oceanographic Centre), with a long-standing expertise in the fields of habitat mapping, biotic and abiotic characters of the seafloor will be analyzed, classified and mapped at unprecedented detail through the use of cutting-edge geophysical instrumentation and their functional relationships will be explored through multivariate statistical analysis. As a second step, new methods based on geo-spatial analysis will be developed in order to derive statistically robust predictive models of benthic habitat distribution, with relevant impact for the conservation of biodiversity and science-based management strategies of natural resources.'",0,0
1000,52090,No,Advanced truck engine control system,"The future European emission standards (EURO IV and EURO V) for HD diesel engines demand new truck engine technologies such as an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), variable nozzle turbocharger (VNT) and exhaust gas after treatment systems. EGR and VNT do influence one another via the exhaust flow and exhaust backpressure. Therefore, within transient operation, a high precision control of EGR and VNT is required to avoid smoke and/or NOx emission peaks. The objective of the proposed project is a research program focusing on a new Advanced Truck Engine Control System ATECS including new strategies for engine control and ECU (electronic control unit) calibration as well as an uncoupling control strategy for EGR and VNT. To achieve this, two European truck engine manufacturers, two suppliers, four university institutes and one combustion engine development company, as co-ordinator will co-operate close together. The expected results are advanced truck engine control strategies for reduced engine out-emissions and improved fuel consumptions as well as an improved dynamic engine response and a reduced transient truck engine application effort. The objective of the ATECS project is a new Advanced Truck Engine Control System to reduce application effort and improve engine control within transient operation. Starting from the base of a state-of-the-art EURO 3 HD Diesel engine concept the potential of combined EGR and VNT-Turbocharger system application is investigated with focus on EURO 4 and 5 exhaust emission requirements. Special effort will be laid on the investigation of a simulation model for improved engine ECU (Electronic Control Unit) calibration under transient conditions including control algorithms for uncoupling control of EGR and VNT-turbocharger. A controller for uncoupled control of EGR and VGT was researched and tested for Heavy Duty Application. One important part was the generation of a time based non-linear model as development platform for this advanced controller. The non-linear model is programmed in Matlab/Simulink and consists on physically based formulas, which means the usage of maps or neural networks was avoided. By this, real time models are available which later can be implemented in the engine control unit and can be parameterised faster than maps calibrated.  The parameterisation of the model was done by taking engine mappings and turbocharger measurements and optimising the parameters with the least square method. The resulting overall model accuracy is within the range \/-5%, which is sufficient for controller design. Important for controller testing was to achieve a realistic dynamic of the system. Therefore not dynamically measurable values, like the exhaust temperature, were determined by process simulation. By this a reasonable transient model tuning was possible. The structure programmed in Simulink was then implemented in the ECUs of a 1L/Cyl. and a 2L/Cyl. engine. For the 1L/Cyl. engine the controller code was implemented in ASCET and for the 2L/Cyl. engine via target link directly implemented in the ECU code. On the test cell it could be shown, that the uncoupling of VGT and EGR is very effectively possible with the model based predictive controller. This was shown for a 1L/Cyl. engine with the control values air mass and boost, and for a 2L/Cyl. engine with the control values EGR mass and boost. The impact of the uncoupled control on emissions was investigated at load steps and within the ETC. It could be shown that under transient test conditions nearly the same NOx and PM emissions can be realised as they are measured under steady state conditions, this means the normally offset between transient and steady state emissions are negligible using the uncoupled control.",0,0

927,225499,No,"SMART, SUSTAINABLE & CONVENIENT UNIT DOSE PACKAGING","Of the total plastic demand, approximately 40% is used to make packaging that is discarded within weeks or days. These short-life plastics bottles, containers, unit dose packaging, secondary packaging have important disadvantages regarding their usage and disposal. Traditional plastics are derived from petroleum, a non-renewable resource, used to produce large quantities of plastics that go to waste (38% go to landfills). Due to the increasing awareness of such environmental impact, there is a growing demand for packaging made from bioplastics (polymers derived from renewable resources or biodegradable polymers). For almost every conventional plastic there is now a bioplastic alternative available on the market that has the same properties with additional advantages. Currently bioplastics represent around 1% of the total plastic produced annually (2M in 2017) but the market is booming (20% growth annually) and many big firms are introducing bio-packaging in an attempt to position their products as green and include the sustainability claim. Moreover, about 80% of European consumers want to buy products which have minimal impact on the environment and will be willing to accept an additional charge in their shopping bag for sustainable packaging. Our project, BIOSNAP aims at taking full advantage of the bioplastics market growth and opportunities towards more sustainable products. We are providing a ready-to market, sustainable unit dose packaging that is 100% bio-based for food applications (olive oil, ketchup, or mayonnaise). Furthermore, it will be made of biodegradable and compostable materials in compliance with UNI EN13432. Our end users (food firms) will benefit from a premium and unique unit dose packaging on the market, and final consumers will benefit from its versatility and ease of use (one hand opening system), being able to safely dispose the packaging with the organic waste.

Building on the researcher’s expertise in both EU law and risk regulation, and the supervisor’s pioneering ‘risk within rights’ framework, it focuses on EU and US case-law to create the first comparative map of judicial standards in this challenging field. It develops the role of law in pandemic preparedness; a crucial issue affecting all of us, and meets the aims of the 3rd EU Health Programme. In so doing, THEMIS recognises that lawyers do not act alone, and that the scholarly and the practical have a reciprocal impact. Thus it utilizes a ‘Lawyers meet Doctors’ dissemination strategy, facilitating inter-disciplinary impact on academic and policy experts. It features two inter-sectoral secondments enabling access to both key EU and global policy-makers (WHO; the Public Health Agency in NI), and cross-disciplinary knowledge-transfer and networking via international workshops co-run with the host institution’s Centre of Excellence for Public Health (one of five in the UK). The researcher’s home at Queen’s will be the Health & Human Rights Unit, the first such unit within a top 20 UK law school. Queen’s also enjoys ‘HR Excellence in Research Status’ and boasts a Gender Initiative for women staff and a long-established Human Rights Centre. Each of these supports the skills and training plan, as do the project’s varied outputs: including a monograph (essential for the researcher’s independent academic position), journal articles, and presentations to both the lay public and policy experts during the secondments. In line with IF objectives, THEMIS enables the researcher to use international mobility, new networks and training to attain a position of leadership in the scholarly community, and contributes to the need for a better understanding of how to prepare for, and respond to, the risks of global pandemics.",1,1

Current and ongoing developments on sources of EM coherent radiation with super-intense peak power and/or ultra-short duration (of at to second scale) at frequencies from the far infrared (fraction of eV) to hard X-rays (keV) makes the present proposal a timely and essential one.  The theoretical framework applies to multielectron quantum systems such as quantum dots, atoms, charged ions and molecules, systems that is known to be of particular importance in cutting edge research areas such as nanoscience, atomic and plasma physics as well as quantum chemistry.  In view of the latest technology developments the implementation of the present project can also contribute to the improvement of these sources through the characterization of the fields by predicting non-linear ionization yields (directly related with second-order autocorrelation measurements) and energy/angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.  By drawing together our complementary expertise around a well-defined subject, through a very successful theoretical approach, namely the R-matrix approach, this project is aimed to solve challenging problems, in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics.  To accomplish this objective, it will be indispensable to merge methods from quantum and computational physics, thus demanding development of numerical algorithms on high-performance architectures.  The host institution - is for several years actively contributing in breakthroughs in the field of the AMO physics - is participating in a number of related European projects and - has an excellent record in incubating successful careers.

Conceptualization of criteria for a scientifically-based selection of biodiversity indicators for organic/low-input farming systems; 2. Assessment and validation of a set of candidate biodiversity indicators in representative case studies across Europe (and in ICPC countries); 3. Preparation of guidelines for the implementation of biodiversity indicators for organic/low-input farming systems for Europe and beyond. Existing indirect farm management indicators as well as direct indicators for genetic, species and habitat diversity will be assessed for their scientific soundness, practicality, geographic scope and usefulness for stakeholders. Candidate indicators will be tested in a standardised design in twelve case studies across Europe and later in three ICPC countries. Case study regions will include pannonian, alpine, boreal, Atlantic and Mediterranean grassland systems (both organic and/or low-input), rain fed organic farms under temperate and Mediterranean conditions, mixed organic farming, organic special crops and low-input tree/agroforestry systems. Plot, farm and regional scales (where applicable) will be addressed. The investigation will include new agricultural practices, e.g. soil conservation, crop rotation management, seed and crop mixtures and economic issues relating to the costs of indicator measurement and to benefits of biodiversity as perceived by different groups of the population.

The catalysts will be constructed using components at the nano-scale in a bottom-up approach. Hereby, catalytically active metal complexes will be linked with nanoparticles such as polymeric microgels, hyperbranched polymers or hybrid systems consisting of silsesquioxanes attached to hyperbranched polymers. Further hierarchical organisation of HiCat catalysts will be accomplished by interconnected networks formed from the assemblies of catalytic nanoparticles using end-functional T-responsive polymers that can interact with functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles as binding agents. Recycling of the catalyst-nanoparticle entities in multi-batch operation will be studied utilizing the change of solubility of the polymer supported catalysts by external stimuli. Based on polymer-nanoparticles linked by T-responsive polymers, new types of films and membranes with graded porosity can be prepared by varying the size of the nanoparticles and the length of T-sensitive polymers. This opens new opportunities for integration of catalytic steps and separation within the hierarchically structured system and, hence for continuous reactor operation. The proposal combines the superiority of homogeneous metal-organic catalysts often possessing nearly 100 % selectivity with the advantage of efficient separation by grabbing a new concept for building up hierarchically organised catalytic systems. Structural principles of tailor-made ligands will be transferred into tailor-made functional surfaces of nanoparticles. For proof of principle of the concept, three types of reactions will be studied: olefin metathesis, CX coupling and enantioselective hydrogenation.",0,0

The theme chosen for this 36-months coordination action is 'sustainable urban management', thus covering the way how the various policy areas of urban development (energy/water/waste, transport, planning and design, social inclusion, etc) are integrated, rather than one of these themes in particular. This focus is based on the assumption that the decoupling of environmental degradation and economic growth can only be achieved through a better management and governance of the largely inter-dependent issues of urban development. Indicators and information systems, efficient and effective policy processes, and innovative public participation are the main instruments to set ambitious targets, gain wide acceptance, and implement behavioural changes in society.  The project is built around a series of events of different nature - so-called Connection Fora, Linkage Fora and Implementation Fora - linking into and building upon each other. They convene local governments from across Europe, researchers in the field of urban sustainability management, and national ministries and agencies dealing with sustainability policies directed at the local level in their respective Member States. A pilot dimension of the project is the 'explorative application' of two selected research-based tools for sustainable urban management by some 100 local governments throughout Europe. This application should explore the connectivity between research and policy-making and deliver criteria for its general enhancement in other thematic areas and in the future.

124,14313,Yes,"The assessment of human exposure from natural, medical and occupational exposure and the associated risks","The overall aim of the project is to develop reliable methods to measure the spectral and angular distribution of external radiation in the workplace and to use the results to estimate effective dose equivalent.  The technique for the measurement of energy spectra and directional distribution of photon fields has been reviewed and equipment changes made to reduce the risk of contamination in the workplace and increase the speed of measurement. Preliminary results have been obtained on the feasibility of using sodium iodine detectors, involving the use of special filters so that they can provide spectral and dose rate information at the same time. Installation of suitable collimation, so that directional information can also be obtained, is under investigation.  Work has started on the EGSA Monte Carlo computer code to determine theoretically the response of photon detection systems as a function of energy and angle. Work has been carried out to install the code onto personal computers and to validate its operation.  Operational improvements have been made on the neutron spectrometry system to reduce the time required to produce neutron spectra from raw data. A new version of the MCNP Monte Carlo code has been written that transports electronics besides neutrons and photons, incorporating the EG54 electron modules.  A tissue equivalent ion cyclotron resonance unit (ICRU) sphere is being used to determine backscatter factors with different X-ray beams from the ISO catalogue in roder to validate MCNP-E in this range of energies. Preliminary calculations have been performed in the kerma approximation in order to determine backscatter factors, mean energy and energy spectrum of the backscattered radiation on the axis of the beam frontally of the ICRU sphere for ISO narrow spectrum series and BIPM series ranging from 10 kV to 300 kV.  In roder to take into account the most recent trends of the ICRU the previous program has to be modified and a revised program is now under consideration.  An extensive review of the literature relating to particle clearance from the human respiratory tract was carried out. Draft documents were completed on: justification of the approach and assumptions in the proposed clearance model; particle clearance from the extrathoracic airways; partical retention in the thoracic lymph nodes. The results were used to select reference values for the proposed compartment model to describe particle clearance from the human respiratory tract.  The model proposed is intended for both dosimetry and bioassay. Target cells have been identified in each respiratory tract region, and the doses to these have to be evaluated, rather than simply the mean lung dose. A microcomputer program, LUDEP, has been developed to calculate doses to each region of the respiratory tract, doses to all other specified body organs, and excretion rates and retention curves. Test calculations were made. For example, for a 1 um AMAD aerosol of a long lived alpha emitter such as plutonium-239 in oxide or nitrate form, it was found that the main contribution to the effective dose from irradiation of the respiratory tract arises from the dose to the bronchial epithelium.  Comparison of the National Radiological Protection Board (NPRB) compendium of dose per unit intake values with data from the Bundesant fuer Strahlenschutz (BFS) has been undertaken. Agreement was very good for adults (97% of nuclides agreeing to within 10%), and slightly poorer for children.  The implications of the draft recommendations of the ICRP on internal dosimetry have been examined. The low weighting factor for bone surfaces allows an excessive dose per year from certain nuclides. Suggestions are made to remedy this, although it may not be relevant to practical situations.  An electronically controlled servopump for dispersion experiments in models of airways has been constructed, to study regional deposition in the human respiratory tract. The effect on particle dispersion of holding the breath for up to 1 minute has been investigated.  A method has been developed to produce submicron monodisperse radioactive particles at a sufficiently high concentration for measurements of clearance and regional deposition in humans.  The retention of radioactive particles deposited from small aerosol boluses in the conducting airways has been measured for different sizes of particles. The slowly cleared portion has been found to decrease from 60% for 1.6 um particles to about 25% for 6 um particles. Estimates of tracheobronchial and alveolar deposition as functions of particle size have been made. Error introduced by assuming the whole tracheobronchial tree to be cleared rapidly in significant, but within the natural biological variation of the data.  An improved spinning top aerosol generator has been constructed to produce spherical iron oxide (Fe 304) particles with a high degree of monodispersity and a high particle number concentration. Using these particles, the intracellular viscosity and the cell activity of lung macrophages have been studied in vivo. The intracellular viscosity has been found to be 65.3 Pa s. The macrophage activity has been characterised as a randomization process with randomization energy of 6.7 E18 J.  The algebraic regional deposition model, based on a statistical analysis of available data, has been extended to make allowance for age and sex, disease, and natural biological varability.  A review of breathing parameters and lung volumes for use in respiratory tract dosimetric models was made. Reference values were recommended for adults and children of several ethnic groups.  A study of the deposition of inhaled particles in the nose of adults suffering from rhinitis was made. Nasal deposition of a polydisperse aerosol of isopropyl myristate was measured in a group of 25 healthy subjects and 24 suffering from infections rhinitis. Anterior rhinomanometry was measured in each subject. Mass deposition was measured by comparing inhaled and expired aerosol concentrations. Nasal depositions of certain masses of particles (in the size range 0.5 to 6 um, 97% of the aerosol) were found to be significantly higher in subjects with rhinitis.  Eight subjects were studied twice, while healthy and while suffering from the disease, and showed clear differences in nasal resistances, pressure drop and aerosol deposition, before and during rhinitis.  An investigation was made of the slow clearance of particles administered by inhalation from the large airways of rats. Fischer-344 rats were exposed to an aerosol of fused aluminosilicate particles labelled with cobalt-57. At 1, 7, 28 and 112 days afar inhalation the animals were killed and the tracheas examined for cobalt-57. A measured length of trachea was defined in situ, then removed and washed repeadally with saline. The region of the first bifurcation was similarly removed and washed. The cobalt-578 content in the washings and the airway wall was determined by scintillation counting.  From 3 days after inhalation, the animals were regularly monitored in a small animal whole body counter, and excretion measurements, of cobalt-57 were made.  The retention of particles in the trachea has been analysed into 3 functional compartments. T1 represents material cleared rapidly, Ts represents slow or stationary material remaining on the surface of the epithelium, and Tur particles sequestered in the airway well. Expressed as fraction of the whole body retention at 1 day after inhalation, multiplied by 1E5 and normalized to a measured tracheal length of 20 mm, T1 decreased from 22 at 7 days to 0.6 after 112 days. Ts was 39 at 7 days and fell to 37 by 28 days and 7.0 by 112 days. Tw remained between 10 and 15 throughout.  The fraction of the inhaled particles estimated to remain stationary or slow moving on the epitherial surface was the largest of the 3 compartments at 7 and 28 days after inhalation, as order of magnitude greater than the rapidly cleared component at 28 and 112 days. It was found that nearly all the cobalt-57 was within macrophages. The study demonstrates that long term retention of particles on the surface of large airways in possible.  About 40 samples of foetal tissues and placentae from abortions at 14 to 19 weeks were obtained. For initial measurements of plutonium-239, combined samples of foetal and placental tissues were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Separate analyses of foetal and placental tissues are now in progress. Measurements of polonium-210, by radiochemistry, have shown concentrations to be about 3 orders of magnitude greater than for plutonium-239, with about 2/3 of the total activity in the placenta.  The transfer of plutonium to the developing embryo and foetus is being studied using rats and guinea pigs. Plutonium-238 was administered to the animals at different stages of pregnancy and transfer to the embryo and foetus determined by autoradiography and tissue analysis. Retention in the total foetoplacental unit (FPU) was similar in the 2 species and increased with advancing gestation. However, distribution of plutonium-238 within the FPU was different, with the yolk sac concentrating the greatest proportion in the rat while the placenta showed greater retention in the guinea pig. Transfer to the embryo or foetus accounted for a small proportion of total FPU activity, with greatest concentrations in early and late gestation and lowest in mid gestation. Preliminary data on the transfer of polunium-210 to the foetus in rats and guinea pigs show that, as far plutonium, the greatest concentrations were in the yolk sac. Concentrations of polonium-210 in the foetus were greater than for plutonium-238 at mid gestation but lower in late gestation.  The animal data have been used to estimate doses to the human foetus from material intakes. For a chronic material intake of plutonium-239 throughout pregnancy taking account of both in utero doses and activity retained by the newborn child, the overall lifetime dose to haemopoietic tissue of the offspring was estimated to be 2 orders of magnitude less than the equivalent material dose.  The rodent foetal gonads have been established as a more sensitive indicator of radiation damage than the foetal brain and levels of irradiation from incorporated radionuclides could be estimated up to 0.37 Gy/day protracted irradiation throughout gestation. The limits of this model are animal survival for the studies of brain histology and germ cell survival for the effect of the gonads. With acute gamma irradiation of 1 Gy on day 15 of gestation, a dose rate effect was observed in brain tissue at dose rates of 23.9 Gy/day and 239 Gy/day but the greatest effect on the testes was observed with 0.87 Gy/day. However, the results obtained after acute irradiation are not applicable to protracted irradiations.  A detailed investigation is underway of the distribution within the human foetus of natural alpha radioactivity using autopsy samples obtained from various stages of foetal development from 18 weeks to stillborn. Where possible samples comprising placenta, cord, liver, spleen, thymus and spine have been obtained. These were loaded against TASTRAK (CR-39) alpha track detector and stored for at least 1 year. The technique allows total alpha activity in a sample as small as 1 gram to be determined with a detection limit of approximately 0.01 Bq/kg. Of 45 cases currently under examination a completed analysis is available for 14 cases.  The alpha activity in the foetoplacental unit appears to be dominated by polonium-210 which is believed largely to be supported by lead-210. Total alpha activity in the placenta is around 0.025 Bq/kg with levels in the liver, spleen and thymus ranging up to 0.05 Bq/kg. Values in the cord appear to be higher at around 0.1 Bq/kg. The highest activities in the foetus are in the spine where values up to 2 Bq/kg with an average of 0.75 Bq/kg are found. The activity in the spine is sufficiently high that it is possible to resolve the level of radium-226 from the total alpha activity present. Here the ratio of total alpha activity to that from radium-226 is around 40 to 1 in comparison with adult bone where the ratio is around 10 to 1. The reasons for this difference could be due to different transplacental transfer factors for radium-226 and lead-210.  The work of mapping radon sources on a large scale have been progressing, with large numbers of measurements of radon in soil gas made and mapped. A method has been developed for transferring data on radon in homes in a given area in a way that preserves the detailed geographical information for correlation with geology without compromising the confidentiality of the radon results.  Measurements have been made of radon levels in new and existing homes with various antiradon measures. About 30 new homes on 3 building sites in a radon affected area are under investigation. The homes all have suspended concrete floors, some incorporating radon preventive measures such as a continuous membrane across the whole floor area and provision for subfloor ventilation. Measurements have shown low radon levels in homes both with and without preventive measures, due to the warm summer. Measurements are continuing through the winter to determine the effectiveness of the preventive measures.  Tests have been carried out in various existing homes and other buildings where radon remedial measures have been installed. In buildings with soild concrete floors, subfloor sumps attached to extract fans have been shown to be effective and durable. Remedial measures on suspended timber floors have proved to be more problematical. Sealing the top surface of the floors has proved to be difficult and disruptive for the householder. The provision of a continuous flow of air across the subfloor space in providing promising results. Underpressuring the space has proved to be less effective in reducing radon levels and more likely to cause problems with dampness. Tests in buildings where the natural underfloor ventilation has been increased by the provision of extra vents have shown this to be unreliable in reducing radon levels.  In order to measure the transport of radon in soil as a function of various soil parameters such as porosity, permeability, grain size distribution, radium content and water content, it was first necessary to design and construct equipment. A cylindrical stainless steel vessel with an inner diameter of 2 m and a height of 2 m was designed. Around the upper metre there is a ring filled with water to close off the air under the lid from the air in the laboratory. In the wall of the vessel are 12 pots for inserting probes. The design of the vessel has been completed and its is now under construction.  A multifunctional probe to measure the radon concentration in the soil gas, the permeability of the soil and the water content of the soil was designed and a prototype constructed. The main problem is the determination of the shape factor of the probe. The shape factor has to be measured to derive values for the soil permeability. For this purpose a perforated box has been designed to be placed near the bottom of the vessel and covering almost the complete cross section of the vessel. The vessel is filled with dry sand through which an airflow is induced via the perforated box. Using this simple geometry the permeability of the sand can be measured without the probes. Afterwards the shape factor can be deduced by measuring the permeability with the probes. In order to select the most suitable type of sand, various samples of commercially available sand are currently being tested for radium content, radon emanation factor, grain size distribution and pF curve.  A set of drilling tools has been made. This includes 4 20 mm coarsie drills with extension rods for depths down to 5 m, and 3 12 mm drills for sampling and for preparation of probe positioning. Also 2 soil samplers, capable of removing 25 cm{3} samplers of soft soil from depths down to 4 m have been made. In addition accessories like a 2.5 m long chisel and a hauling tool have been made. The drills are operated with a hand held electrical machine supplied from a portable generator. Experience with the drilling tools and a borehole casing technique have been gained during the period.  A radon emanation measurement system for small samples (50g) of soil has been assembled and tested. The system is based on scintillation cells with renewable scintillation foils. The air volume of the total system is kept as low as 150 cm{3} in order not to dilute the radon concentration. The results achieved so far indicate that the background count rate, even with fresh scintillation foils, is too high.  A probe for gas permeability measurements in soil has been made. The probe, which has a diameter of 16 mm, is led through the borehole casing tube to the measurement position. A packing procedure designed to prevent gas leaking along the casing has been tested in the laboratory. The necessary field instrument for the permeability probe has been assembled and preliminary laboratory and field measurements have been performed.  Soil gas radon concentrations at a depth of 0.5 m have been measured at a number of potential test site locations at Risoe National Laboratory and an area has been selected, where the test structure is to be established. The soil in the area is mainly moraine clay. This type of soil is typical of a large part of Denmark. In addition, the soil gas radon concentrations have been measured at 6 locations and the permeability at 1 location close to the planned site at depths of 0.5 m to 0.7 m.  Initial modelling efforts have been directed towards the design of the experimental site. Analytical expressions for a linear, cylindrical and spherical geometry have been used for estimating the effective soil gas resistance, the depletion of soil gasradon and the radon entry as functions of the geometrical parameters and soil permeability. A 2-dimensional, finite difference model for studying soil gas transport has been developed. It has been used to examine the influence of a high permeability layer at the interface between soil and test structure. It was found that the incorporation of such a layer would make the experimental situation less sensitive to possible soil inhomogeneities close to the entry point.  The possiblity of using the 3-dimensional finite difference code TRISCO for the evaluation of radon mitigation strategies in dwellings was considered. The domain of validity of the model was delimited and the following main hypotheses were justified: the radon transport from soil into a dwelling occurs mainly by pressure driven air flow; the air flow under the slab is assumed to be laminar; the steady state condition is assumed. The program calculates the pressure fields under the floor. Because all the details of the configuration can be included in a very simple way and because of the simple and useful graphical outputs, the code appears to be particularly well suited to calculating pressure fields in the soil, therefore allowing practical evaluations of mitigation systems performances.  Measurements have been made in a school with high radon levels and remedial measures recommended. The degree of permeability to air of the studied zone of the building was measured using the pressurization method. The air tightness of the inner walls of the various rooms was also evaluated. Measurements of tracer gas (nitrous oxide injected in the basement) concentrations in different rooms for different experimental conditions were made, as a function of time, together with radon concentration measurements. Conclusions were drawn concerning the radon entry paths and the influence of a number of factors on the measured concentrations and some remedial measures were recommended.  A model was developed to estimate the dose equivalent to the public due to soils and buildings, as a function of various soil and building parameters. The model takes the following radon sources into account: pressure driven radon transport via the soil into the underfloor space and dwelling; diffusion of soil gas into the underfloor space successive transport into the dwelling; exhalation of radon from building material. To calculate the respect we contributions, the numeric values of a number of input parameters were fed into the model. These parameters relate to: soil (porosity, emanation factor, radium-226 content); weather (temperature gradient inside to outside, wind direction and strength); location (watertable, geometry factors); building materials (surfaces, thickness, emanation factor); inhabitants (ventilation, residence time). The calculation was performed using typical parameter values encountered in the Netherlands and radiation doses were obtained which were in the expected ranges.  Field investigations have been carried out in an area which is underlain by carboniferous rocks ranging from limestones to mudstones and sandstones with intrusions of basic igneous rocks. Uranium concentrations have been identified which could give rise to high radon emanation. Survey methods have involved the measurement of soil gas radon and thoron, gamma spectrometric determinations of bismuth-214, thallium-208 and potassium-40 photopeak intensity in soils and rocks and have included the determination of total uranium and labile radium. Analysis of the data shows that most of the variation in total gamma activity can be attributed to variation in uranium concentration in rocks and soils. Statistical analysis indicates that there is a highly significant difference in the radon values in soil gas, in relation to rock types, so that the geological map provides a useful first indication of radon in soil gas distributions. Repeated traverses covering an area of contrasting geology, land use and rock permeability shows an identity in radon distribution patterns for different seasons. Laboratory studies for the determination of emanation coefficients of soils are underway and data is being compared with studies of carrier gas concentrations already undertaken. A provisional soil gas radon concentration map has been produced. Early data indicate that this provides a good indication of areas in which houses with radon values above the action level may be found.  2 houses have been instrumented for collecting continuous data, which includes environmental temperatures in a variety of locations indoors and outdoors, pressure differences across the building shell in a variety of locations and radon gas concentrations in different indoor and subfloor zones. The data is recorded electronically and hourly averaged data is stored on a computer located in the house. The 2 houses both have indoor radon concentrations which average between 100 Bq/m{3} and 200 Bq/m{3} in the living level and the source of the radon is the soil. The first house, labelled 901, consists of a basement with 2 attached crawlspaces and a single floor living level above the substructure. The second house, labelled 902, consists of a rectangular 2 storied house on top of a small crawlspace on top of the ground.  A radon flow model has been developed which takes as input time varying measured airflows and predicts the time varying radon concentrations in each zone specified indoors. Modelling efforts have been concentrated in 2 areas. The first has been to develop a simple formula for air infiltration into a dwelling which calculates the air infiltrating from the soil gas separately from the air infiltrating from the outdoor air. Also, the mechanisms driving air inflitration are limited to temperature differences between the indoors and the outdoors and to wind and these mechanisms are treated as separately as possible. The second effort has been to develop a procedure for calculating airflows between zones for use in the radon flow model. Some preliminary tracer gas measurements in house 901 have been completed, to give total infiltration into different zones but not interzone flows.  A hydroxypyridone derivative of desferrioxamine (DFO-HOPO), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DPTA) and a dihydroxamic derivative of DTPA (DTPA-DX) were tested at dosages of 30 umol/kg for their ability to remove plutonium-238 and americium-241 from rats after their intravenous injection as citrate or inhalation as nitrate. The 2 siderophore analogues were provided free of charge by Professor K Raymond, Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley. The most effective treatment regimen for onjected plutonium-238 was the repeated administration of DFO-HOPO. After 7 days the body content was reduced to 8% of that in untreated animals; the value after DTPA treatment was 15%. Repeated dosages of 3 umol/kg DFO-HOPO were as effective as those of 30 umol/kg DTPA. After inhalation of plutonium-238, repeated treatment with DTPA, DTPA-DX or DFO-HOPO reduced the body content and day 7 to, respectively, 10, 15 and 31% of controls. After inhalation of americium-241 DTPA-DX and DTPA were equally effective, the body content being reduced to 7% of control values with repeated treatment. Injection of DFO-HOPO was ineffective for enhancing the elimination of inhaled or injected americium-241. These results support the strategy of examining the use of siderophore analogues for the decorporation plutonium and americium. However, at present, DTPA should remain the agent of choice, particularly after inhalation.  The efficacy of calcium DTPA and zinc DTPA have been evaluated for removing thorium from the rat after its deposition as nitrate in the lungs. When the initial mass concentration in the lungs simulated human exposure to 4 times the average life intake (ALI) for thorium-232, the prompt (300 or 1000 umol/kg body weight at 30 min) or repeated (30 or 300 umol/kg body weight at 30 min, 6 h, 1, 2, 3 day) administration of calcium DTPA was at best only moderatly successful forenhancing the elimination of thorium-232. By day 7 after exposure, the body content was res pectively 74%, 65%, 90% and 74% of that present in untreated animals. When the mass concentration in the lungs simulated acute exposure to 1.7E-3 times the ALI for thorium-232, the efficacy of treatment was not increased appreciably despite the substantial reduction in mass. After the repeated administration of calcium DTPA at dosages of 30 and 300 umol/kg using the protocol above, the body content of thorium by day 7 was respectively 69% and 51% of that in untreated animals. Under comparable conditions, the efficacy of zinc DTPA was less than calcium DTPA. The results of these experiments suggest that more effective chelating agents are needed for the treatment of workers overexposed to water soluble thorium compounds.  In the past decade, several phenolic compounds have been investigated in animals for their ability to prevent fatal uranium poisoning. The most promising derivative appears to be sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulphonate (Tiron). In experiments conducted at National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), the compound was administered to rats in dosages of 30, 300 or 1000 umol/kg at 20, 60 and 180 min after the intratracheal instillation of uranyl nitrate. The amounts of uranium deposited in the lungs of rats were equivalent to intakes by workers of about 12 times the permitted daily limit of 2.5 mg. The average body content of uranium 5 days after exposure, using the treatment regimens above, was respectivly about 100%, 78% and 65% of that in untreated animals. These results suggest that the administration of Tiron is of limited practical value for enhancing the elimination of uranium from the bodies of overexposed workers.  This investigation concerns: the efficacy of the siderophore analogues code named DFO-HOPO (a hydroxypyridone derivative of desferriozamine) and DTPA-DX (a dihydroxamic derivative of diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) for enhancing the removal of plutonium and americium from the body of the rat after intravenous injection of the actinides; and the study of the reduction of bone tumour risk in plutonium-239 treated rats through the near lifetime administration of zinc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (zinc DTPA) in drinking water.  The study of the effects of continous oral zinc DTPA on bone tumour induction in male Sprague-Dawley rats injected with 37 kBq plutonium-239/kg body weight was completed when the last rat died. Preliminary analysis of the results indicates that treatment with 10E-3 M zinc DTPA as drinking water, beginning 4 days after plutonium-239 injection, reduced the bone tumour incidence from 3.75 \ or - 2.0% to 15.0 \ or - 2.5%. When the start of treatment was delayed until 30 days post plutonium-239 injection the tumour incidence was reduced only marginally but the survival time to death with a bone tumour was increased by about 17% as compared to untreated rats.  The effects of the 2 new chelators, DFO-HOPO and DTPA-DZ, were compared with that of DTPA in male Sprague-Dawley rats following a single intravenous injection of plutonium-238 and americium-241. Following subcutaneous injection of 30 umoles/kg at 1 hour after radionuclide injection, DFO-HOPO reduced plutonium retention in skeleton and liver, at 7 days postradionuclide injection, to 19% and 6%, respectively, of that in untreated animals. Similar treatment with calcium DTPA was less effective, reducing the skeletal retention to 39% and that in liver to 25% of that found in the untreated controls. DFO-HOPO had no effect on the retention of americium-241. The combination of DFO-HOPO with calcium DTPA was even more effective than DFO-HOPO alone in reducing retention in skeleton and li ver. DFO-HOPO given orally at a dose of 100 umoles/kg 3 minutes after the nuclides was as effective as the injected substance in reducing retention of plutonium-238 in the skeleton and liver. DTPA-DX, following either subcutaneous injection or oral administration, was less effective than calcium DTPA in removing plutonium from the skeleton and liver, or americium from the skeleton. Injected DTPA-DX did reduce the liver retention of americium by a factor of about 3 compared to calcium DTPA. The effectiveness of DFO-HOPO was found to decrease exponentially with time after plutonium-238 injection, the approximate half-times for the mobilization of the nuclide from skeleton and liver were 6 and 12 hours, respectivley. Within the dose range 0.3 to 10 umoles/kg, a negative linear relationship was observed when the mobilizing effect was plotted against the logarithm of the injected dose of chelator.  Continous chelate infusion, for 14 days aftr radionuclide injection, was achieved by means of implanted mini-pumps. In general, tissue retention was reduced to a greater extent than by the single injections of the chelators. However, with DFO-HOPO the continous infusion was no more effective than the single injection for mobilizing plutonium from skeleton and liver.  This work concerns the investigation of the efficacy of the siderophore analog 3, 4, 3-LIHOPO (containing 4 hydroxypyridinone groups) in comparison to diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) for enhancing the decorporation of plutonium-238 as a tributylphosphate complex (plutonium-238 TBP) after inhalation in Sprague Dawley rats. The first purified sample of 3,4,3-LIHOPO (50 mg) was tested by intravenous injections in rats previously exposed to an aerosol plutonium-238 TBP. 3 groups of rats were used: group 1, 5 rats exposed to plutonium-238 TBP as untreated control animals;groups 2 and 3 exposed to plutonium-238 and injected respectively by DTPA and 3,4,3-LIHOPO. The average initial lung burden was about 3.7 kBq (5.7 ng plutonium). Unique intravenous injection of the different chelates was performed 1 hour after the end of inhalation at a concentration of 30 umole/kg. The rats were killed 7 and 14 days after contamination and lungs, livers, kidneys and femurs collected. The different organs will be counted, results are not yet available.  This investgation concerns the study of the effect of haematopoietic growth factors o At present, techniques for measuring neutron spectra in the workplace are well developed and measurements will be made at various nuclear installations. For photons, NRPB has designed a simple method to obtain spectral and angular information using Geiger-Muller detectors. Alternative methods of obtaining such information will be investigated, using sodium iodide and germanium detectors.   These devices will be used for measurements in the workplace, and calculational methods will be developed to use these measurements to estimate effective dose equivalent from external photon radiations. Calculations and experimental measurements will be extended to other irradiation geometries for the evaluation of the response of personal dosemeters. The implications of such measurements for personal dosimetry will be investigated and the relationship between operational dose equivalent quantities and effective dose equivalent will be evaluated.   NRPB will coordinate this project, which deals with methods of measurement of the spectral and angular distribution of external radiations in the workplace and draws on experimental investigations and photon transport calculations by the Monte Carlo method. It will provide the expertise and facilities to develop reliable methods for measuring the spectral and spatial distributions. The implications of such measurements for personal dosimetry will be considered, including their utility in making estimates of worker doses.   In collaboration with the UKAEA, ENEA and CEA, NRPB will evaluate various methods to obtain spectral and angular information on external radiations and examine ways in which the data obtained can be used to estimate effective dose equivalent. The NRPB secondary standard calibration laboratory will be used to test various measurement techniques before they are used in the workplace. At present, the techniques for measuring neutron radiation spectra in the workplace are relatively well developed, so efforts will be concentrated on evaluating methods to measure the spatial and spectral distributions of photon radiations. Furthermore, the  feasibility of obtaining useful spectral information for beta radiation in the workplace will be investigated.",0,1
976,222961,No,"Choreographing Emigration: Japanese Tango Musicians in Shanghai, 1920-1945","Between 1920-1945, many Japanese tango musicians migrated to work at the Shanghai dancehalls. The cosmopolitan city of Shanghai was considered by the Japan musicians as the authentic place to work and to polish their skills as tango performers. There is evidence, however, that upon their return to Japan such musicians came to participate in the Japanese government's pro-emigration politics of this time. During 1920-1945, tango music and its eroticised visual images were used by the Japanese government for their pro-emigration campaigns to further encourage Japanese immigration to South America. Tango was used as representing South American-ness, and this propaganda motivated the Japanese immense fascination for the continent resulting in increased number of migrants, encouraged by the images of 'ideal gender relations' of the continent. This concept was produced through tango's visual images, and sexualised narratives in popular magazines, and through tango song lyrics in the newly established 'Japanese tango song' genre. Japanese popular musicologists, migration and gender studies specialists, Japanese and Latin American studies scholars have studied the political organisation of the Japanese fascination for South America, as well as China, using historical analyses and under the lens of modernity. The ER will use these methods in innovative ways to study the role of music in the orchestration of Japanese immigration to South America, 1920-1945. This project will contribute new knowledge on the Japanese tango musicians' activities in Shanghai and their roles as musicians and composers in the pro-emigration politics of this time. Through this project the ER will develop new skills in archival research, Chinese language skills, data analysis, publication preparation, presentation, dissemination, and social media communication skills. The ER will undertale fieldwork and archival work in 4 cities, publish 2 papers, present at 2 conferences, and organise a conference.",0,0
18,200003,Yes,Predicting Response to Depression Treatment,"The objective of the Predicting Response to Depression Treatment (PReDicT) project is to conduct clinical, health economic and commercial research to validate the clinical performance and to complete the pre-commercial development of the P1vital PReDicT Test (formerly the eHealth P1vital® Oxford Emotional Test Battery (eH-ETB)), a novel medical device to improve the treatment and management of depression in clinical practice. On completion of the PReDicT project, the P1vital PReDicT Test will be ready for market launch. Depression is a common, serious and in some cases life‐threatening condition, affecting around 350 million people in the world and 11% of EU citizens suffer from depression at some point in their life. It takes 4-6 weeks after starting antidepressant treatment before a physician can detect whether the treatment is working, the majority of patients with depression do not respond to the first treatment they are prescribed and it can take several months before an effective treatment is identified. During this time a patients’ ability to work and function socially is severely impaired, and they can spend many weeks or months absent from work placing a substantial burden on the economy and healthcare resources. The P1vital PReDicT Test addresses this problem by identifying within 1 week of starting treatment whether an antidepressant is working or not which can significantly reduce the time required to identify an effective treatment.  Patients benefit from this by returning to good mental health sooner. The aggregated economic cost of depression in the EU is €92 billion, amounting to 1% of the total European gross domestic product.  It is estimated that the P1vital PReDicT Test has the potential to reduce these healthcare and economic costs by more than 10%. Thus the PReDicT project focuses on a patient-centric, enabling technology that not only improves efficiency and outcomes for patients but also significantly reduces socio-economic costs.",1,1
62,205829,Yes,Insights into the role of phages on the bacterial resistome,"There is an imperative need to gain knowledge on the spread and evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Recent evidence from environmental, animal and human microbial studies shows that AMR is ancient and environments without contact with anthropogenic antibiotics possess abundant AMR genes. Bacteriophages are the most abundant entities in Earth and recent studies provide indirect evidence for the major role of transduction in the dissemination of AMR genes. Hence, phages might be of critical importance for evading one of the bottlenecks (ecological connectivity) that modulates the transmission of AMR genes from natural environments to animal and human biomes.  In this proposal, a holistic and multidisciplinary approach that combines molecular genetics, genomics, metagenomics, in-vitro experimental analysis, computational biology, bioinformatics analysis, and modelling will be followed to measure the potential of naturally occurring phages to be vehicles for AMR transmission and spread in environmental systems with different antibiotic selective pressure. This comprehensive approach will allow us to better understand the phage-bacteria interactions that drive the AMR spread in different ecosystems. From this understanding we expect to be able to design and develop new tools for the control of antimicrobial resistance in clinical and veterinary practice as well as in agriculture.  This project will contribute to the objectives of the Work Programme by: 1) allowing the researcher to gain new skills and additional training-through-research in phage and phage-bacteria interactions, computational and (meta)genomic analysis; and to become an EU leading specialist in a research field with emerging growth potential; 2) transferring the acquired knowledge to the EU; 3) establish a long-term collaboration between several centres of excellence that will enhance the quality of research of Europe and make it more competitive and attractive for high-profile researchers.",1,1
833,111564,No,Optical Quantum Control of Magnetic Molecules,"A revolution is underway, as molecular magnets are establishing a fundamental link between spintronics, molecular electronics and quantum computation. On the other hand, we know almost nothing on how a magnetic molecule is affected by electrons flowing through it or by the excitation of a molecular group. OptoQMol will investigate these uncharted waters by developing innovative, ultra-clean methods that will provide information inaccessible to established procedures. This will allow an unprecedented study of the interplay of electronic and spin degrees of freedom in magnetic molecules and of its possible use for quantum logic.  OptoQMol is a strongly multidisciplinary project, and makes use of an innovative mix of chemical and physical methods to overcome present experimental limitations, both in terms of time resolution and cleanliness. Instead of placing a magnetic molecule between bulk electrodes, we will directly grow photoactive groups on the molecule, so that electrons will flow through or close to the spin centers after a light pulse. This affords an ultra-clean system that can be studied in bulk, with a perfectly defined geometry of the magnetic and electronic elements. We will then combine optical and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques with ns time resolution, so as to observe the effect of electron flow on the spins in real time and measure the spin quantum coherence. Eventually we will use these innovative methods to control the interactions among spins and perform quantum logic operations.  The success of OptoQMol will answer two fundamental questions: How do molecular spins interact with flowing electrons? How can we use electronic excitations to perform quantum logic operations between multiple electron spins? The results will open a totally new area of experimental and theoretical investigation.

881,40156,No,Methodologies and design criteria for soil and water resource manag ement and policy formulation in peri-urban farming systems in Southern Africa,"The main goal of this proposal is to provide the economic, scientific and technological means to expand income generating vegetable farming activities in Southern African countries. This will be carried out through interdisciplinary soil, microbiological, environmental and agronomical research required to create methodologies and establish design criteria allowing for improved resource management in peri-urban areas through the use of mixed intercropping systems. It is envisaged that the results obtained with accompanying socio-economic studies, should also yield guidance and proposals to permit policy formulation at the regulatory and institutional levels that will lead to increased market driven food security in cities surrounded by informal settlement communities in Southern Africa. Other specific objectives include : * developing mixed intercropping combinations, including the use of appropriate indigenous vegetable crops, to optimize small-scale crop production in the peri-urban areas; * developing methodology for energy-balance relationships on small plots; * establish minimum additions of nutrient-rich materials needed to produce household compost with high soil-conditioning and soil water-conserving ability; * use neuronal networks to characterise microbial population dynamics so as to monitor and control nutrient availability in digesters and compost; * create a network of institutions and competent researchers in critical areas of soil, irrigation and plant science, environmental and soil microbiology to improve their capacity to manage the available resources in the peri-urban areas to provide for income generating, sustainable agriculture. Expected Outcome  The major benefits from the research hereby proposed is the development and expansion of income generating vegetable farming activities, carried out in the small plots of land available. This is a critical issue in the Southern African region and the conclusions and recommendations can probably be extended to other DC regions. Coupled with this major benefit, other social / developmental benefits will accrue, in particular the poverty alleviation and social uplifting of the residents, the improved diet intake with increased vitamin content and a clear amelioration of the environmental quality, health standards and greening of peri-urban settlement areas. This project will focus the research efforts on four major work packages : A. Household water and waste treatment processes using composting and waste water digestion to improve the recyclability of water, to recover nutrients and to provide soil conditioners; B. Low cost, high efficiency irrigation technology - to minimize the use of water for each of the cropping systems tested; C. Soil, water, plant interactions - to compare the agricultural productivity of the various crops under the different conditions existing in the participating Southern African countries, in order to establish viable and appropriate mixed intercropping farming systems; D. Socio-cultural, economic and institutional issues - incorporating socio-cultural approaches to choose 'best' solutions, to foster community residents' interest in the proposed solutions, to carry out economical evaluation of the systems' options and outputs, and identify the regulatory/institutional measures necessary to underscore the financing of infrastructure and the maintenance of communally managed systems.

100,226939,Yes,Algorithms and multiplex assays for integrated serological surveillance of malaria and neglected tropical diseases,"Malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma and schistosomiasis affect almost 2 billion people every year. Coordinated targeting of these diseases will aid future control and elimination campaigns, but this will require integrated surveillance strategies. Malaria surveillance is routinely implemented through cross-sectional surveys where blood samples are tested for parasites. A major barrier to routine NTD surveillance is the range of samples required for parasite diagnosis: stool, urine, blood, eye swabs and skin snips. Instead of direct detection of parasites, there is an opportunity to implement serological surveillance by measuring antibodies to multiple pathogens in blood samples collected for malaria surveillance.  This proposal has four aims: (i) Characterise the sero-epidemiology of malaria and NTDs in longitudinal cohort studies in Senegal, Ethiopia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea; (ii) Measure antibodies to 34 antigens from 12 pathogens from single blood samples; (iii) Model antibody kinetics and validate the use of serology for detecting infections; and (iv) Demonstrate how a population’s concurrent and past exposure to multiple parasites can be estimated by analysing multiplex data from cross-sectional surveys.  These aims will be achieved through innovative epidemiological studies, new technologies, and especially developed analytic methods, including: (1) utilisation of multiplex bead-based Luminex assays; (2) mixed-effects models in a Bayesian framework with data augmentation to identify serologically suspected infections, with validation against confirmed infections; and (3) statistical algorithms for reconstructing long-term and recent transmission trends.

These tools are designed to support a more collaborative relationship between doctors and their patients.  Project results are designed to support the provision of mental health services online and could accelerate the development of an 'e-Mental Health' service sector.  Work description: Develop Internet Based systems to improve availability and flexibility of diagnostic tools and services for eating disorder:  The project will develop Internet-based diagnostic systems for the four major eating disorders: Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder and Obesity. These tools will be developed as separate components and will target early stage detection, as well as interim diagnostics for detecting patient progress. They will provide treatment plans for both the patient and the professionals, whose help the patient is seeking. Existing knowledge and methods, which today is available from a few specialists, will be made available to many more people.  Qualitative success: will be measured by user response to ease of use and comfort as well as the volume of satisfied users. Quantitative performance will be based on measure such as time saved in terms of filling out diagnostic forms, the number diseases, and disease stages covered by the new tools, the ease of integrating the questionnaires into existing diagnostic practice, as well as the time saving in administration of patient information  Develop Internet Based Intelligent Natural Language Question-Answering System on Eating Disorders: The question-answering system will answer queries from users in natural language and find the most suitable answers to each question, by matching the question against the data base of answers in a more intelligent way than ordinary Internet search engines. Questions will be produced by experts on eating disorders and will be a collection of common questions they receive.  Success will be measured by asking users to directly indicate if the answer was appropriate and helpful to them. Questions and answers will be anonymously logged, and the log files will be used to successively increase the quality of the answers which the system produces.  Develop web based and mobile tools to support the implementation of a more convenient, mobile and cost effective therapeutic environment for eating disorders: SALUT will develop web based and mobile tools designed to help patients progressively achieve recommended behavioural and lifestyle changes. These tools will be based on a 'Self Help Guide' that is part of a cost effective strategy under development by the University Hospital of Geneva. (Potential collaboration with Stanford University, Palo Alto California, USA) The tools will be developed either as web based or mobile components running on PDA (personal digital assistants) or 3G web devices. Patients can choose for example to keep dietary records on their smart phone, look up and follow specific recommendation on their home computer, and monitor progress on their PDA. These components can be run as a stand-alone application or as clients connect to a server (or home computing platform) to centralise and collect information. The project will, as needed, consult experts on graphical design, web design, and application interface design in order to develop fully interactive, and convivial interfaces. These tools will also be tested in together with online community tools to assess their potential for extending support group sessions to remote patients, and for making expensive post treatment following more economically feasible.

1018,45048,No,High energy density sorption heat storage for solar space heating,"OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT   A primary technical obstacle to a wider use of regenerative energies, especially solar energy, for heating purposes is an adequate storage technology for low-temperature heat. Therefore, in this project a heat storage system based on solid sorption technology will be developed with the following objectives:   1. Development of a prototype series of the solid sorption heat storage system, with energy densities, four to five times higher than water (at AT=50 K), being suitable for the longterm storage of low-temperature heat.  2. Testing of these prototypes in the application of seasonal storage of solar thermal energy for space heating purposes under different climatic and system conditions.   3. Optimization of sorption materials for low-temperature heat storage applications by specific modifications of the material properties.  TECHNICAL APPROACH   The system consists of a series of independent storage units (modules), which will be industrially prefabricated and combined to a suitable system on the location.   The working programme of the project will be split into the following steps:  1. Material research for an Optimisation of the sorption materials.  2. Development and construction of prototype storage modules. Test of experimental units at the Solar House, Freiburg, Germany.   3. System integration and one-year monitoring of the prototype modules for solar space heating under different climatic and system conditions in Austria and Finland. In both cases the objective is to meet the entire heating demand with regenerative sources, whereas solar energy plays the primary role and different regenerative back-up systems will be studied.  Assessment of the results from the system monitoring and feedback on the design of the storage modules.   EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS   1. Development of an adequate technical solution to the heat storage problem, which may be extended to other applications, like industrial waste heat recovery, combination with small CHP systems or solar cooling.  2. Introduction of a new heat storage system for solar space heating with an energy density which allows seasonal storage of the entire heating energy demand of low-energy buildings in a common basement room under Central or Northern European climatic conditions.   Improvement of know-how in solid sorption technology in basic fields, such as adaptation of material properties to the desired application or technical solutions to enhance heat and mass transfer, which will also be useful for non-storage  applications, like chemical heat pumps and heat transformation systems for heating and cooling.

618,199736,Yes,"PROMOTING MENTAL WELLBEING IN THE AGEING URBAN POPULATION: DETERMINANTS, POLICIES AND INTERVENTIONS IN EUROPEAN CITIES","Major depressive disorder, dementia, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse affect a substantial part of the European older population. Over 70% of Europeans reside in cities, and this percentage will increase in the next decades. Urbanization and ageing have enormous implications for public mental health. Cities pose major challenges for older citizens, but also offer opportunities for the design of policies, clinical and public health interventions that promote mental health. The overall aim of the MINDMAP project is to identify the opportunities offered by the urban environment for the promotion of mental wellbeing and cognitive function of older individuals in Europe. The project will advance understanding by bringing together longitudinal studies across cities in Europe, the US and Canada to unravel the causal pathways and multi-level interactions between the urban environment and the social, behavioural, psychosocial and biological determinants of mental health and cognitive function in older adults. Specifically, the project will (a) assess the impact of the urban environment on the mental wellbeing and disorders associated with ageing, and estimate the extent to which exposure to specific urban environmental factors and policies explain differences in ageing-related mental and cognitive disorders both within as well as between European cities, (b) assess the causal pathways and interactions between the urban environment and the individual determinants of mental health and cognitive ageing in older adults, (c) use agent-based modelling to simulate the effect of urban environmental, prevention and care policies on the trajectories of mental health and cognitive ageing across cities in Europe. Knowledge will significantly contribute to future-proof preventive strategies in urban settings favouring the mental dimension of healthy ageing, the reduction of the negative impact of mental disorders on co-morbidities, and maintaining cognitive ability in old age.",1,1

548,92196,Yes,Development of a high sensitive and specific nanobiosensor based on surface enhanced vibrational spectroscopy dedicated to the in vitro proteins detection and disease diagnosis,"The main goal of our proposal is to develop a novel optical nanobiosensor based on extraordinary vibrational signal enhancement of the proteins to be detected. To reach vibrational signal enhancement, we will exploit the optical properties of specially designed metallic nanoparticles which should act as nanoantenna and the associated field enhancement to obtain a direct detection of proteins bound to the nanoparticle. Thus, our sensor will reach high sensitivity provided by the recently established large enhancement of vibration signals due to the resonant excitation of the nanoantenna device used as substrates. The aim is to detect only a few proteins with concentration much lower than 1pM and finally to reach detection threshold such as femtomole or lower. High molecular selectivity will be reached with the functionalisation of the nanoantenna. Such functionalisation will selectively favour the immobilisation of the protein to be detected at the vicinity of the nanoparticle surface, providing the best enhancement and then the detection of the targeted protein. Our nanobiosensor will include two main components: the nanoantenna device which corresponds to our sensor transducer and the functionalisation which corresponds to its bioreceptor. And then, each functionalised nanoantenna device used as vibrational signal enhanced system is an individual and specific nanosensor of proteins. As a consequence, our nanobiosensor integrated in a vibrational spectroscope will allow the detection and the analysis of the enhanced vibrational signal from the targeted proteins and thus corresponds to our diagnosis instrument. Our nanobiosensor will be validated on the detection of proteins on body fluids.These proteins have been chosen since they have been identified as specific biomarkers of common pathologies. This validation will be applied it to improve their detection (better sensitivity, decrease of the detection threshold) and open the way to the early diagnosis.",0,1
307,17077,No,Customisation Environment for Multimedia Integrated Patient Dossiers,"NUCLEUS is a project developing the prototype of an integrated patient dossier. This is based upon the intelligent Act Management concept developed in the ESPRIT project RICHE. Together with the prototype dossier, facilities are developed to allow customisation of the dossier and its contents for the various end-user categories. The research concerns the development of a prototype of an integrated dossier which includes the professional information administration facilities en completeness and accuracy of patient data. Data protection and access control is addressed.  The work has concentrated on the domain of business analysis, user r the appropriate structure of the architecture. Important results were achieved o management and the technical facilities of the project. The activities on concep on the development of more detailed computational and engineering models, in pre actual development of the components of the prototype, were initialized and part the business analysis activity, the professional use of the patient dossier in t processes of the HCP was analysed and modelled. Typical case studies were formaluniform representation of the functional manipulations of the patient dossier wa Significant preparatory activities were performed on the development of key conc requirements activity, the user requirements for the patient dossier system were business analysis.  Subsequently, the end user abstraction level of the patient specified. The end user interactions with the system were identified and classif precise data exchanges on the occasion of such interactions. Moreover, the local constraints between end user interactions were pictured. This abstraction level has been published in a formal deliverable.  Detailed planning and management of work was performed, and guidance was provided on substance methodologies, techno organization of the respective activities.  An Architecture Base Document has be which the scope, structure and content of the architecture work have been specif End-users of the NUCLEUS patient dossier system are all kinds of health professionals: key criterion is their need to maintain, communicate and access a patient dossier, probably beyond the scope of their own professional practice.   A patient in the hospital or its outpatient facilities has one unique patient dossier, containing all ever recorded data on his health status and on the care for his benefit. This patient dossier notion comprises the speciality or individual (paper) patient dossiers usually held by the respective health professionals. The RICHE patient dossier has implemented this patient dossier notion, with links between the various components of the dossier.   NUCLEUS starts on the premise that all data contained in the patient dossier are produced during the performance of (actual) acts for the patient's benefit, more precisely: on the occasion of (actual) act status changes. Data about the act and patient dossier data are stored in (metaphorical) 'forms': as data objects. These implement the basis for the advanced structuring and navigation through the so-called Patient Reference Dossier (PRD). NUCLEUS develops a cross-section of the functions to manage the PRD.   Acts are performed by health professionals. They need the facilities to specify which acts they can perform, under what circumstances, and how these are represented in the patient dossier: they make a 'catalogue' of their repertoire of services available to other health professionals wishing to request their services. NUCLEUS develops these Performer Act Customisation (PAC) facilities.   Health professionals (when duly authorised) require access to the patient dossier, as if it were one single entity, irrespective of its actual implementation. PRD acts as a major reference assisting in this access. Some of the access is structured: it follows the structures that have been recorded as the patient's case evolved. Other access is less structured: it requires efficient views of the patient dossier following queries in the mind of the health professional. Some of these views may be recurring, others may be ad-hoc. NUCLEUS develops these Access Customisation (AC) facilities.   Consistency, completeness and accuracy of patient dossier data are vital. Moreover, the required technologies cause significant system administration provisions to be planned. Authorisation control is a vital issue in the context of patient dossiers and their dissemination. For these reasons NUCLEUS develops Professional Information Administration (PIA) facilities.   Through Performer Act Customisation the health professional has complete freedom to specify the scope and content of his recordings in the patient dossier. Hence, NUCLEUS does not develop the content of a patient or medical dossier: it develops a structure and facilities to implement any such dossier, subject to the professional judgement of those involved, on the basis of strict application of Act Management concepts.   In its first year NUCLEUS has analysed the professional use of the patient dossier, formulated the user requirements for its solution, and developed the end-user interactions in detail. In its first and second year NUCLEUS further specifies the detailed conceptual, computational and engineering models for its solution. The architecture basis is fully conformant with that of the RICHE framework. In its second year NUCLEUS develops the respective components of its prototype; these are integrated towards the end of the second and in the beginning of the third year. Finally, the integrated prototype is demonstrated, and validated in the market of end-users.   NUCLEUS Features   NUCLEUS develops the structure of the integrated multimedia patient dossier, based on the principles of Intelligent Act Management, as explicated in RICHE. Moreover, NUCLEUS elaborates the facilities to customise the patient dossier according to the requirements of the respective health professionals in their various roles.   NUCLEUS aims to achieve these ambitions by developing an integrated demonstrator on the basis of the necessary components of a system that implements the required functions.  The NUCLEUS integrated multimedia patient dossier is available to all categories of health professionals. They can configure (their part of) the integrated dossier according to their needs, both structurally and ad-hoc. The latter permits them to create virtual dossiers, representing specific views of the actual dossier.   NUCLEUS considers health professionals as any health care worker with full professional qualifications (according to WHO or similar standards) who is qualified and capable to care for those suffering from or affected by illness, to prevent illness and/or to promote community and/or individual health. Health professionals include physicians, nurses, medical support staff, paramedical staff, etc. Moreover, certain categories of ancillary services' staff and administrative professionals may under certain conditions be considered as health professionals.   The NUCLEUS patient dossier for a patient contains all recorded data on the patient's past, present and planned health situation, and on the past, present and planned care for the patient's benefit, irrespective of the ownership of these data, their physical location, their format and their medium. The NUCLEUS patient dossier comprises all specific (speciality, departmental, etc.) patient dossiers usually held by individual health professionals and departments.   Every patient has one unique NUCLEUS patient dossier. In practice, every patient has one unique NUCLEUS patient dossier in the scope of one single institution.   The NUCLEUS patient dossier is integrated: it is a representation of the patient dossier that allows everything contained or referenced in the patient dossier to be accessed, extracted and retrieved as if the dossier where one single entity: irrespective of the applied format and irrespective of the originally supplying health professional (subject to functional requirement and access authorisation).   The NUCLEUS patient dossier is based on extensive application of the 'electronic forms' metaphor: in these forms, associated with the historic evolution of the patient's health case (structured in actual acts), the professional data are recorded, together with information about links with other professional data, and typical methods to manipulate the dossier data. NUCLEUS electronic forms are (composite) data objects, exploiting an object oriented formalism which allows optimum structuring of the implementation of and navigation in the patient dossier.   NUCLEUS develops two kinds of customisation: - through Performer Act Customisation, it allows health professionals in the performer role to specify and customise the content and rules of 'their' activities for the patient's benefit; through Access Customisation, it allows health professionals to construct views of the patient dossier according to specific information needs.   Performer Act Customisation provides the following facilities:  - The facilities to adapt the knowledge about classes of acts to the professional paradigm of the performing health professional: Performer Act Customisation of the knowledge about classes of acts.  - The facilities to adapt and relate the recording of patient dossier data (particularly of Act Professional Contents) to the professional paradigm of the performing health professional: Performer Act Customisation of the Act Professional Contents.  - The facilities to support the usage of customised Act Professional Contents by the performing health professional and other authorised users (like, for example, requesters): the effects of Performer Act Customisation when feeding data into customised Act Professional Contents.   Access Customisation provides the facilities to request, access, retrieve and present patient dossier data in line with the professional paradigm and requirements of the user who needs to consult the patient dossier.   The NUCLEUS patient dossier is structured by means of the Patient Reference Dossier: these functions convert a heterogeneous and distributed physical storage of patient professional data (usually in the direct environment of the 'owner' health professional) into a notion of the patient dossier which makes it appear homogeneous and integrated to any authorised health professional in the hospital.   Special attention is given to aspects of authorisation, security and consistency preservation of the integrated dossier. Facilities to communicate dossier extracts between application modules (across the nodes of distributed networks) are provided. Facilities of dynamic manipulation of (partial) data models in order to specify the dossier view required by a health professional are provided. Technology for the exploitation of structural and virtual links between dossier data objects are applied. These activities are largely developed in the frame of Professional Information Administration.   Plans   NUCLEUS is planned to terminate in the course of 1994. Until its completion the following summarises the plans of the project: -  - (Continuation of) development and maintenance of consistent conceptual data and process models for the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Finalisation of the detailed computational models for the main components of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Further development and finalisation of detailed engineering models (in particular interface standards and interworking protocols) for the main components of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Development of common services for the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier prototype system and its components.  - Development of prototypes of the main components of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Finalisation of the development, and quality assurance of prototypes of the main components of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Integration of the main component prototypes into a single working prototype of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Post-integration testing and quality assurance of the single working prototype of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - End-user acceptance, quality assurance and validation, demonstrations of the single working prototype of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - The project is appropriately managed, guidance is given to the work of the project on material, conceptual, methodological and other issues, and proper concertation and co-ordination with the AIM Programme as a whole and with other parallel projects and programmes is assured.  - Preparations and plans are made for the integration and quality assurance of the component prototypes and of the single working prototype of the NUCLEUS Patient Dossier system.  - Appropriate technical management of the project is provided, covering development and integration issues, and in particular co-ordinated application of the various technology platforms.  - Adequate publications and presentations of the mission, objectives, progress and results of the NUCLEUS project will be made.",1,0
770,185738,No,"""""Landscape connectivity for Cat species: transcending structures, scales and climates""""","'Anthropogenic pressures drive global biodiversity loss. The loss of landscape connectivity, further exacerbated by climate change, is a key driver of species decline. Hence, it is crucial to identify key elements that ensure landscape connectivity across landscapes and scales. Several challenges in this context include insufficient knowledge of 1) species’ eco-physiology across landscapes and ranges, 2) the mechanisms driving migration pulses, 3) how local-scale processes (animal movements) translate to large-scale and longer-term patterns (species’ distributions and range shifts), and consequently, 4) the spatial scale(s) at which connectivity needs to be maintained to mitigate climate change effects on species. These issues are best addressed through comparative studies across a range of landscapes and climates, using umbrella species requiring large areas. Using lynx species in North America and Europe as models, this project will establish an integrative approach across scales to predict functional connectivity for wild felids, specifically by a) determining eco-physiological thresholds to environmental stressors and mechanisms driving dispersal pulses between peripheral and core populations, b) investigating the influence of climate and habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure and eco-evolution of these species, and c)  identifying how local-scale processes translate into large-scale patterns of connectivity, species’ distribution and range shifts. Ecological and environmental data across continents will be integrated using groundbreaking eco-physiological and landscape genetics tools, and dynamic simulation modelling (using the novel individual-based model RangeShifter).

B3 integrins are also involved in a variety of pathological processes including thrombosis, tumor invasion and metastasis, and have become major targets for drug development. Inherited molecular defects in the aIIb or ,B3 subunits have been identified in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients, and shown to be responsible for defective platelet aIIb,B3 receptor function. The aim of this project is to stably express autofluorescent, GFP-tagged wild type and mutant aIIbB3 receptors in mammalian cells, in order to investigate their biosynthetic pathway and intracellular trafficking by 3 colour confocal microscopy as well as biochemical analysis of the posttranslational processing. We hope that these studies will contribute to a better knowledge of the structural requirements necessary for integrin aB dimerization, posttranslational processing, intracellular trafficking, recycling and signal transduction, and provide some clues for the understanding of the reduced surface expression of aIIbB3 in GT type II patients. Identification of structural domains necessary for receptor transport and surface expression could lead to the development of a new generation of therapeutics aimed to specifically inhibit ,B3 integrin intracellular processing pathways in a way similar to those characterized for mutant B3 integrins in GT patients. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  As integrins mediate a large variety of pathological processes, the identification of structural domains involved in integrin subunit-subunit interactions, intracellular transport and integrin affinity modulation is extremely important for the design of a new generation of therapeutics that could act intracellularly in a cell type specific manner by inhibiting integrin processing pathways. This project could also help to validate the concept thatinhibition of the integrin endocytosis pathway could prevent integrin-dependent viral, bacterial or parasite internalicontribute to the development of drugs designed to block 3 integrin mediated viral, bacterial or parasite internalization into host cells.

590,37535,Yes,"Development of murine transgenic systems for the experimental study of tumour initiation, progression and treatment - Animal models of human cancers","Experimental carcinogenesis has, until recently, relied on the use of animal models in which the tumourgenic process is distantly related to that observed in humans. More recently, the use of transgenic mice hemizygous for a tumour suppressor gene has opened new opportunities but has also revealed two limitations : first some of the most prominent tumours observed in genetically predisposed humans are not observed in the corresponding mice (retinoblastoma is not observed in mice hemizygous for Rb); second for most instances (with the notable exception of p53) mice homozygously inactivated for a tumour suppressor gene are not viable. We propose to overcome these difficulties by the development of a modular transgenic mouse system which should enable the appearance of defined somatic mutations in a tissue specific manner. This system is based on the use of the Cre recombinase which directs recombination between two small oligonucleotidic target sequences called Lox. Recombination between two Lox sites in a direct (head-to-tail) orientation causes excision of the intervening DNA. This principle can be used to inactivate a tumour suppressor by inducing the deletion of a critical exon. The production of 4 series of conditional mutants which will target either Rb or TP53 or APC or NF2 is proposed. The use of transgenic constructs in which the Cre recombinase is placed under tissue specific promoters should enable to restrict the Cre expression to a relevant tissue (i.e. to the retina for a conditional Rb mutant).   An additional degree of sophistication is proposed which will enable to trigger the creation of defined somatic mutation not only in a tissue specific manner but also at a time that is decided by the investigator. This approach is made possible by the development of new regulatory systems which restrict transgene expression in cells that express an engineered transactivitor that is active only in the presence of tetracycline. This further development should be extremely useful in the analysis of tumour progression. Ultimately, development of a 'two channel' system based on two independent inducers (i.e. tetracycline and tamoxifen) and two independent recombination systems (Cre/Lox and Flp, Frt, a system related to Cre/Lox found in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) should provide excellent flexibility to analyse in detail the consequences of the occurrence time of the different mutations that contribute to tumour initiation and progression.   Finally, the development of an original tissue specific model of retroviral insertional mutagenesis eventually combined with the production of mouse strains that are hemizygous for a defined region containing a putative tumour suppressor activity should provide an approach to the isolation of new genes involved in the tumourigenic process.   It is expected that this work will provide a set of new biological resources that should enable further insight into the basic mechanism of tumourgenesis. It will also provide animal models of human cancer which will be useful in testing the new therapeutic protocols (including gene therapy) that will undoubtedly be proposed in the coming years.",1,1
598,91210,Yes,Role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in angiogenesis,"Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones and is involved in different physiological and pathological processes such as cancer and ischemia. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a reversible process, mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Although the role of PTKs in angiogenesis is well established, little is known about the function of specific PTPs in this process. In collaboration with Dr. H. Augustin, (Heidelberg, Germany) we found that the expression of several PTPs changes when spheroids of endothelial cells embedded in 3D matrices are exposed to angiogenic stimuli. To investigate the role of PTPs in angiogenesis, we generated a tetracycline-inducible shRNA library for targeting PTPs. We are also generating lentiviral vectors expressing inducible cDNAs of all the human PTPs. I propose to investigate the biological role of PTPs in angiogenesis by loss- and gain of function experiments in endothelial cells, using different in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays. My studies will determine the role of PTPs in developmental and pathological angiogenesis and test their merits as targets of angiogenic therapy.",1,1
2,96590,Yes,Microbial translocation across host barriers,"Infections remain the primary cause of mortality in humans. New infections are emerging, and resistance to antimicrobial drugs is widespread and expanding. There is thus an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on rationally-designed drugs blocking the pathogenic effects of microbes on the host. A prerequisite for this is a complete understanding of the pathophysiology of infectious diseases. Systemic infections result from the invasion of hosts by a microbial pathogens, and a critical pathogenic determinant is thus microbial translocation from the external environment into the host and dissemination to protected tissues such as the central nervous system and the fetus. Our project is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of certain microbes to cross the intestinal barrier, the blood-brain barrier and/or the placental barrier. Specifically, we will pursue the following objectives: (i) understand how invasive pathogens adhere to host barriers, (ii) understand how invasive pathogens cross cell monolayer barriers, (iii) determine microbial fate and dynamics within the host, and (iv) determine how host responses influence barrier vulnerability to invasive pathogens. Because we will address these biological questions in a tissue and whole-host context, this project will integrate in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches. It will allow us to address questions in a novel dimension, defining a transition from cellular microbiology to tissular microbiology. Completion of our objectives will provide critical information on key pathophysiological steps critical for the understanding of microbial pathogenesis, and will also improve our basic knowledge of host barriers biology during homeostasis and upon microbial aggression.",1,1
138,96043,Yes,Stochastic Mortality and the Dispersion of Subjective Estimates of Survival Probabilities – Evidence from 11 European Countries,"Recently, the analysis of stochastic processes for mortality change have gained considerable interest in insurance and finance research. This project aims at assessing how stochastic mortality is really perceived by individuals. Stochastic mortality, or aggregate mortality risk, refers to the fact that future mortality rates are uncertain. Uncertainty arises from the fact that the drivers behind changes in mortality over time, e.g. medical progress or general living and nutrition conditions, are themselves outcomes of stochastic processes. For individuals, theoretical models indicate that the uncertainty around future mortality rates is an important determinant for saving and asset allocation, especially annuitization decisions. This project therefore wants to assess how stochastic mortality is perceived in reality. Lacking data on direct subjective estimates of the volatility of mortality rates we aim to use methods developed in research analyzing the information content of the dispersion of financial analysts’ estimates. We can utilize a rich micro-level data set, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), a project financed by the European Commission. SHARE covers major EU countries and includes subjective estimates of individuals’ survival probabilities. Our aim is to investigate if, like in the analysts’ forecasts, the dispersion of respondents’ answers is informative in the sense that the dispersion is linked to the actual gender, age, and country-specific volatility of mortality. Estimates for actual volatility of mortality rates will be obtained by calibrating a standard model for stochastic mortality with data from the Human Mortality Database. Our results will be highly relevant in the context of pension reform. For pension reforms which emphasize individually managed retirement savings and asset allocation, it crucial that individuals make informed decisions. Our results deliver relevant input for the design of pension systems.",1,1
576,103906,Yes,Molecular and Genetic Study of the human infections by Capnocytophaga canimorsus,"'Capnocytophaga canimorsus are Gram-negative bacteria from the normal oral flora of dogs, which cause rare but  severe infections in humans that have been bitten or simply licked. The most common syndrome is fulminant septicemia with peripheral gangrene.  Mortality reaches 40 % in spite of antibiotherapy and amputations. My laboratory pioneered recently the study of this new pathogen.  We engineered genetic tools, sequenced and annotated the genome and determined the surface proteome of a strain isolated from a fatal infection.  This showed that C. canimorsus have abundant surface-exposed lipoproteins forming a new kind of feeding complexes, some of them specialized in deglycosylating glycoproteins from the host. This property allows C. canimorsus to feed by grazing oligosaccharides at the surface of human cells. The present research program aims at characterizing these deglycosylating complexes, unravelling their role in neutralizing the innate immunity and promoting growth within the host and finally characterizing their assembly at the bacterial surface. Genomic comparisons  will help defining which of these many complexes play a critical role in human pathogenesis.  Besides this, the lipopolysaccharide structure will be determined and genetically manipulated to understand its low endotoxicity and small anti-inflammatory effectors present in the culture supernatant of C. canimorsus will be identified.  Growth in human blood of wild type and mutant strains will be monitored by isothermal microcalorimetry in the hope of developing a surrogate of animal model.  Such a 'virulence' model would allow to address the question whether all dog's strains are equally dangerous for humans. It would also open an avenue for testing differences in individual human susceptibility. All this knowledge will give new insights in this emerging pathogen and might lead to prevention of the disease caused by C. canimorsus'",1,1

722,220394,Yes,Structural basis for the therapeutic efficiency of optimal-affinity T cell receptors,"Demographic change includes population ageing, and incidence rates begin to increase for many types of cancer in middle-aged and elderly people. Traditional cancer treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, while tumour immunotherapy by T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer represents an alternative form of treatment. The transfer of tumour-specific TCR genes into patient’s peripheral blood lymphocytes targets cancer specifically and effectively. But while patient-derived low-affinity TCRs do not show therapeutic activity, optimal-affinity TCRs, as isolated from newly-generated antigen-negative humanized mice with a diverse human TCR repertoire, can effectively delay tumour regression. X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool of structural biology, which helps researchers to identify the three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules such as TCRs complexed to their cognate peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules. Recent research uncovered the docking topologies of naturally selected TCRs, but therapeutically efficient optimal-affinity TCRs recognizing tumour-associated self-antigens, have not been analysed to date. The exceptional specificity of TCRs is determined by three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the TCR alpha- and beta-chains. Biomedical research on TCR gene therapy and design of future clinical trials will hugely benefit from the identification of CDR-mediated contact points made between therapeutic TCRs and the pMHC on their target cells. TCRabX is an interdisciplinary research project investigating the 3D structures of 13 TCRs complexed to MHC-I or MHC-II, respectively. It connects innovative clinical immunology research in Berlin/Germany and world-class structural biology research in Melbourne/Australia.

852,89603,No,Regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species by the plant NADPH oxidase and its role in pathogen response and in response to other environmental or developmental factors,"The production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is one of the earlier responses observed after pathogen infection in plants.  It is becoming evident that ROS are not direct killers but signals that mediate the activation of the plant defenses as well as other responses to the environment, developmental processes and Programmed Cell Death (PCD). This topic is of such importance in plant biology that it was recently the subject of a Special Issue in Plant Physiology (June, 2006), were the importance of the NADPH oxidase was specially outlined. Plants use ROS-derived signals in a variety of developmental contexts and in response to both biotic and abiotic stress. It is hence important to understand the signaling controls that allow plant cells to interpret ROS-dependent signals.  Our goal is to decipher, using functional genomics tools, the functions of the plant NADPH oxidase gene family. Different members of the rboh (respiratory burst oxidase homologues) family, components of the plant NADPH oxidase, control production of ROS during defense and other responses. We will perform this research in Arabidopsis, model organism for studies in plants, where many genomic tools are available. We intend to further the identification of the factors that regulate Atrboh function, as well as putative targets or mediators of ROS-dependent signaling. It has been suggested that phosphorylation events and Ca\\ signaling are implicated in this regulation. In addition, many evidences suggest the existence of a crosstalk between ROS and other signaling molecules like salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). We are particularly interested in the signaling interaction between ROS and heterotrimeric G proteins that mediate responses like pathogen defense and stomata closure. These studies will allow us to further understand the function of ROS not only in disease resistance, but also in other responses to the environment and developmental processes.",1,0
436,73981,No,BIOMASS FUELL CELL UTILITY SYSTEM,"Energy from Biomass needs highly efficient small-scale energy systems in order to achieve cost effective solutions for decentralized generation especially in Mediterranean and Southern areas, and for applications without adequate heat consumer. Thus fuel cells are an attractive option for decentralized generation from biomass and agricultural residues but they have to meet at least two outstanding challenges: 1. Fuel cell materials and the gas cleaning technologies have to treat high dust loads of the fuel gas and pollutants like tars, alkalines and heavy metals. 2. The system integration has to allow efficiencies of at least 40-50 percent even within a power range of few tens or hundreds of kW. This proposal addresses in particular these two aims. Hence the first part of the project will focus on the investigation of the impact of these pollutants on degradation and performance characteristics of SOFC fuel cells in order to specify the requirements for appropriate gas cleaning system (WP 1-2). These tests will be performed at six existing gasification sites, which represent the most common and applicable gasification technologies. WP 3 will finally test and demonstrate the selected gas cleaning technologies in order to verify the specifications obtained from the gasification tests. The results will be used for the development, installation and testing of an innovative SOFC - Gasification concept, which will especially match the particular requirements of fuel cell systems for the conversion of biomass feedstock. The innovative concept comprises to heat an allothermal gasifier with the exhaust heat of the fuel cell by means of liquid metal heat pipes. Internal cooling of the stack and the recirculation of waste heat increases the system efficiency significantly. This so-called TopCycle concept promises electrical efficiencies of above 50 percent even for small-scale systems without any combined processes.",0,0

She will employ a holistic approach to attain high-precision chronology from tree-ring sequences locked in surviving wooden structures in these environments.

The cost of high-grade wood rapidly rises following increase in market demand. The European SMEs express great concern over this issue as the estimates show that in the next decade the cost for high-grade wood species may reach levels to be unaffordable to most SMEs. One of the ways to solve the problem is to come up with new materials that will be based on low-grade woods but have the same characteristics as high-grade woods. The technology that will be developed in the course of the Project will be based on the creation of new nano-composites of molecular fillers and modified wood fibres in a solvent medium.

Low medical adherence represents a heavy burden for the EU28 in terms of: - Cost due to extra medical treatment that needs to be given and to additional hospitalisations: estimated at 125,000 M€/year. - Premature deaths that could be avoided with correct adherence to medication: over 200,00 citizens/year Currently there are several solutions that attempt to increase medication adherence, but none of them reaches a sufficient market penetration because they are not useful enough or do not fully meet user demands.  To bridge that market gap, we have developed SIGUEMED.  SIGUEMED is an IoT eHealth solution aimed at fostering and monitoring medical adherence in a disruptive way.  By combining a smart personalized blister pack with printed circuits in its foil (key enabling technology), wearables connected via Bluetooth to the base dock and a SW platform, we are able to remind to the patients intake the time for the intake of pills, and to track if and when this intake has taken place.

72,222906,Yes,Eschatological time as women’s time? Gendered temporality and female holiness in Early Christianity and Byzantium,"This proposal investigates the nexus between time and the construction of the feminine in Late Antique and Byzantine hagiographical discourses. By looking both at ways time is experienced through the body and construed by society and religion, GenTime engages with a highly debated problem in Byzantine studies: why did female saints progressively disappear over the Byzantine millennium? GenTime argues that this trajectory has to be understood against the eschatological expectations shaping early Christian ideals of female holiness. In the 2nd and 3rd century the impending end of times subsumed any other temporality and led to the subversion of traditionally construed “women’s time”. Once the Roman Empire became Christian, the eschatological horizon was reinforced in Byzantium by the widespread circulation of apocalyptic motives, adopted by the Imperial power for political and moral purposes. Eschatologically-motivated narrative patterns about women saints became entrenched and their ongoing success made it hard to accommodate new experiences of holiness when other models of lay temporality eventually emerged during the Middle Byzantine era. GenTime looks at stories about women saints produced between the 2nd and the 13th century CE by adopting a longue durée perspective and using narratology to analyze how patterns of temporalities are inscribed in the text. It builds on feminist phenomenology to highlight the persistence of strategies used to control women’s time within patriarchal social orders. GenTime works with medieval sources and it reflects on the dialectics between integration/assimilation, minority/majority cultures, gender/societal values, all of them of major concern in modern societies. In doing so, it raises awareness about the ways gendered discourses of time have historically been used to promote lifestyles that, ultimately, have less to do with women’s empowerment and more with power struggles between competing social groups.",0,1
27,199191,Yes,Pathogen and Graphene,"Complications related to infectious diseases have significantly reduced, particularly in the developed countries, due to the availability and use of broad-range antibiotics and wide variety of antimicrobial agents. Excessive use of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents increased significantly the number of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. This has resulted in a serious threat to public health. The inexorable rise in the incidence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens, coupled with the low rate of emergence of new clinically useful antibiotics, has refocused attention on finding alternatives to overcome antimicrobial resistance. Novel strategies aiming to reduce the amount of antibiotics, but able to prevent and treat animal and human infections should be investigated, evidenced and approved. Among the various approaches, the use of graphene and its derivatives is currently considered a highly promising strategy to overcome microbial drug resistance.

1009,92119,No,String theory and noncommutative geometry,"I am interested in various algebraic-geometric aspects of string theory and its implications for gravity, cosmology or gauge theories. I am investigating how different kinds of algebraic structures (e.g. Lie groups, Hopf algebras, supersymmetry, and their deformations appearing in noncommutative geometry) act as symmetries of different physical models. My main research topic is the study of applications of noncommutative geometry to physical systems, in particular to various kinds of gauge field theories, like theories with time-dependent backgrounds as they appear in string cosmology, as well as deformed supersymmetric theories and quantum groups. I have been able to find a cohomological approach which will enable me to solve these systems by using the rigidity of their algebroid structure to construct a suitable homotopy operator. This technique, originally developed in the context of deformation quantization for symplectic and Poisson structures, when combined with other techniques developed in the framework of Hopf algebras, such as the Drinfel’d twist, will allow me to gain me useful insights about these physical models as well as about the differential geometric structure of Lie algebroids and Lie 2-algebras. Another research topic, in which recently I am very interested, is the investigation of the geometry of exceptional Lie groups, such as G2, F4, E6, and their applications, e.g. for the construction of manifolds with G2 holonomy and as gauge groups for field theories which appear as low energy limits of string theories. Theories with G2 gauge group are relevant for quark confinement, while E6 is the most promising candidate as the symmetry for grand unification in particle physics. The same methods can be applied to other exceptional Lie groups, even E8. I have found a technique, which makes use of a suitable fibration of the group to generalize the Euler parametrization for SU(2), allowing me to compute explicitly the metric on the group manifolds.",0,0
1013,108761,No,Dense Deployments for Green Networks,"The exponential growth in demand for higher data rates in wireless networks requires a massive network densification that is neither economically or ecologically viable with the current cellular architectures. This has stimulated an intense research activity in green or energy-efficient cellular networks. In this regard, a promising solution is inspired to the concept of small-cell networks, which is founded on the idea of a very dense and heterogeneous deployment of operator-installed low-cost and low-power base stations connected via a backhaul infrastructure, endowed with multiple antennas, and equipped with cooperative and cognitive technologies. Although promising, this new concept makes the cellular architecture increasingly complex and poses many issues. Interference management is one of the many technical challenges that must be dealt while designing such networks. The objective of this fellowship lies in identifying and posing in the right modeling perspective the theoretical performance of such interference-limited networks and in finding the algorithmic solutions to approach those limits. The methodology of investigation uses many of the mathematical tools that have been recently proved so useful (random matrix theory, cooperative game theory, and stochastic geometry). The research will be conducted in close collaboration with some of the leading experts in the field, thereby ensuring a step-by-step research-through-training activity that from the analysis of the state of the art will guide me towards the objectives of this fellowship. The latter are briefly summarized as follows: 1) To broaden the application of the investigated mathematical tools in order to derive tractable and general models for dense heterogeneous networks; 2) To provide conceptual insights on the design of efficient communication technologies for the deployment of small-cell networks; 3) To understand the energy-efficiency limits of beyond-LTE wireless networks.",0,0
