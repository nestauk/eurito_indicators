377,194580,No,Between the representation of the crisis and the crisis of representation. How crisis changed the symbolic background of European societies and identities. Implication for policies and policy making,"This project aims to understand what kind of social identity change is going on within European societies.   For policy-making, the analysis of social identity is highly valuable because the social identity moderates the impact of policies. And this is particularly true in times of crisis. In particular, the project aims: A) to verify whether the symbolic universes grounding the social identity has undergone a major change within European societies, as a consequence of the socio-economic crisis; B) to draw strategic and methodological implications for policy-making from point A. This project includes 4 core scientific work packages: a) Multilevel Analysis of the Symbolic Universes,  aimed at mapping structurally  and developmentally  the systems of meaning (i.e. the symbolic universes) grounding the social identity; b) Case Studies for policies, aimed at see how different policies have been organized and how their impact might or might not have been moderated by the symbolic dynamics at stake; c) the results of this analysis will be transformed into abstract criteria, contextualised in 5 different European macro-Regions, discussed with stakeholders, opinions leaders, policy-makers and finally stored within the guidelines; d) finally, the guidelines will be validated  in terms of pertinence, effectiveness and the feasibility criteria, through seminars with the policy makers, opinion leaders and stakeholders, belonging to national, European, international Agencies involved in the construction and implementation of policies. Also, focus groups will be organized in each cultural context in order to study the impact of context-specific criteria.",0,0
522,214707,No,Imagining the Rural in a Globalizing World,"With globalization primarily considered an urban phenomenon, its impact on rural areas tends to be neglected. Tackling this blind spot is urgent as rural-urban divides persist and rural communities, notably in the 2016 Brexit vote and US election, claim their concerns about globalization’s effects are being ignored. RURALIMAGINATIONS focuses on the crucial role played by cultural imaginations in determining what aspects of contemporary rural life do and do not become visible nationally and globally, which, in turn, affects how the rural can be mobilized politically. Using a distinctive humanities approach, it examines prominent cultural imaginations of the rural in film, television and literature in the UK, US, Netherlands, China and South Africa, asking: 1) to what extent do these imaginations render globalization’s effects on the rural (in)visible? 2) what role do traditional rural genres and the feelings or desires they attach to the rural play in this making (in)visible? 3) how can new aesthetic repertoires highlighting the rural as a site of globalization and addressing rural-urban divides and inequalities be developed? The five subprojects conduct, in their national contexts, a narrative, visual and discursive analysis of post-2000 rural imaginations, guided by an innovative theoretical framework combining three concepts: the chronotope reveals what the imagined rural time-space renders visible and how it relates to urban and global time-space; spectrality gives access to what rural imaginations render invisible and to their haunting by traditional genres; and affect exposes how these imaginations attach feelings and desires to the rural, impacting its evaluation and political mobilization. The project synthesis compares the five contexts and examines how rural imaginations interact globally. Expert workshops in the national contexts forge collaborations between humanities scholars, social scientists and cultural producers to develop new rural imaginations.",0,0
136,41556,No,Efficiency and financial constraints,"The project will focus on the analysis of financial constraints from a normative standpoint. We will characterize the optimal financial contract when the social value of investment exceeds the private value. If the ex post revenues are privately observed by firms, the threat to terminate funding solves the agency issue. Then, there is a trade-off between inducing truth reporting and realizing socially valuable investments. Therefore, from a welfare perspective, it may be optimal to provide a 'long purse' to firms even in this context. We will analyze not only the optimal level of funds but also the structure of financing. For that purpose, we have to address the issue of the existence of multiple creditors. The recent insights of the multiprincipal theory will be used to derive the results. We will apply this analysis to the European economic policies concerning the financing of less-favored areas and the investments of multinational firms engaged in imperfect competition.",0,0

Sept 2009 with 1000 events by 200 local organisers all over Norway, coordinated by the Research Council of Norway (RCN). The RCN submits this coordinated proposal from Norway proposing 15 subcontracted local events selected after national competition. Local and RCN co-financing are substantial. In this nationwide effort researchers are directly involved in informal contact, dialogue and collaboration with the public at large (kids, teenagers, adults and parents, teachers, entrepreneurs, politicians…), well covered by the media. Focus is on the contribution of research and researchers to the society at large, to “de-mystify” research, show that researchers are ordinary people, and how interesting it is to be a researcher. Events include ”hands-on” lab experiments, interactive settings, night in aquarium, cod aquaculture, research vessel study tour, planetarium, Gründer camps – all featuring ”real science”. Industrial partners and EU-supported researchers are included. Professionals will be invited to join the RN 2010 poster competition where winners are selected by public voting on the RCN website www.rcn.no prior to the Night’s award/exhibition ceremony at the RN Darwin Anniversary event in Oslo. The European Corner stand will be at the NTNU Open Lab event in Trondheim. We hope to match RN 2008 when awareness campaigns by nationwide newspaper inlets, advertisements, emails, web-site information, and media coverage, reached an estimated 16.7 mill and 5.8 mill people respectively – not bad for a 4.5 mill population. A reinforced impact assessment will include perceptions before/during/after the RN.",0,0
437,190979,No,Nano-technology enabled repositioning of Disulfiram as an anti-cancer stem cell agent,"'Most cancers remain ‘incurable’ and life-thretening. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the source of chemo/radioresistance and responsible for cancer recurrence which suggests the urgent requirement of CSC-targeting drugs. Drug development is a slow (15 years/drug) and costly (US$1.5bn/drug) procedure with only 5-25% of new oncology drugs in clinical development actually reaching the market mainly due to the toxicity of novel molecules. This dilemma has led to an increasing appreciation of the potential of repurposing of known drugs. We have demonstrated that Disulfiram (DS), an old anti-alcoholism drug, possesses excellent anti-CSC activity with low toxicity to normal cells. Whereas its cancer clinial indication is limited by its bio-instability (~4 min half-life in blood stream). Our pilot data demonstrated that the anticancer efficacy of DS is significantly improved when mild extending its half-life by liposome encapsulation. In this study, the Incoming Fellow, who has very strong technical knowhow in cancer research, molecular pharmacology, anticancer drug development and nano-encapsulation, will bring novel nano-biomaterials invented in China into Europe. Taking advantage of the state-of-the-art facilities, CSC models, pharmaceutical resarch and developmental expertise and scientific/technical support from the Incoming Host and the other European collaborators, we will develop a long-circulating nano-encapsulated DS. The anticancer activity of the nano-encapsulated DS will be examined in vitro and in vivo in breast and liver cancer cell lines as well as the relevant CSC models. This study will pave the path for clinical trial of DS in cancer indication. The significance of this project will be: 1. Expand and extend our FP7-IRSES (2011-16) platform to strenthen long-term collaboration between China and EU partners; 2. Develop a new cancer therapeutics for the benefic of healthcare in Europe; 3. Open a new drug developmental window to benefit European economy.'",0,0
390,58668,No,Ecophos pilot and demonstration plant for new innovative ecologically friendly and economical processes for the phosphates industry,"EcoPhos, the project coordinator, has developed on laboratory scale novel processes for the conversion of phosphate rock to phosphoric acid, feed phosphates and co-products, based on proprietary chemistry. These processes give promise of significant environmental and economic advantages compared with the wet processes currently in use, according to simulation studies carried out by M&F Process Simulation (project co-initiator). The EcoPhos technology offers a solution to the problem of massive gypsum generation inherent to the wet process route. Ecophos, M&F and its consortium of partners propose to build and operate a Pilot & Demonstration plant to confirm the technical and environmental feasibility of these processes as well as to demonstrate their economic viability on a credible semi-industrial scale.

994,193285,No,Platform for ultra-sensitive Point-of-Care diagnostics for Infectious Diseases,"The aim of the PoC-ID project is to develop new micro- and nanoelectronic-based sensing and integration concepts for advanced miniaturised in vitro diagnostic devices. The project addresses the increasing demand for rapid and ultra-sensitive point-of-care diagnostics to reduce healthcare costs and increase the quality of life with a focus on infectious diseases, one of the world’s leading causes of morbidity and death. Interdisciplinary collaboration using the technology and expertise of the consortium members will be applied to develop and test a breakthrough PoC prototype for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infections and host responses in the paediatric context.  PoC-ID will enable new types of point-of-care diagnostics for virtually any type of complex liquid sample. Applications are disease diagnosis, monitoring of therapeutic responses, clinical research of pathogen-host interaction and personalised medicine. The platform technology can easily be adapted to a variety of diagnostic or biosensing purposes, such as in health/environmental monitoring or food quality testing.  PoC-ID will combine the detection of both pathogens and host responses leading to more accurate diagnosis as compared to the current standard which is focused on detection of pathogens only. This novel approach will support prevention and control of pathogen spread and enable faster and more personalised patient treatment. Improved performance in terms of robustness, sensitivity and selectivity will be reached by a combination of innovative nanomembrane technology, molecular engineered capture molecules and two novel sensing concepts.  Further advances will be realised in terms of usability and speed of data-analysis arising from the integration of sensors, read-out electronics and microfluidics into one user friendly point-of-care (PoC) platform. Costs of the new disposable sensors will be ultra-low at high volumes, thanks to designing into microelectronics production flows.",0,0
295,59300,No,Psychology and Economics,"The standard economic theory often fails to provide results that fit the empirical evidence we have on human decision-making both at the micro-economic and at the macro-economic levels. Recently, the scientific communities in Psychology and Economics have demonstrated their willingness to co-ordinate their expertise in order to find a coherent formal framework that would capture the true preferences of individuals. Yet, only a few attempts in this direction have been made to date. The main objective of the proposed Euroworkshops is to promote a systematic co-operation between scholars in these two dynamics fields. Indeed, by bringing together academics in Economics and Psychology, the two conferences are expected to start developing a dual scientific community that would result in the creation of a new and more realistic approach to explain human behaviour. Moreover, this should help studying important issues such as environment, management of resources and growth. The proposed Euroworkshops will address two of the most important and controversial topics concerning human judgement, decision-making and, more generally, the relation between Economics and Psychology.  These are: 'Preferences and Utility Functions' and 'Judgement under Uncertainly'. First, it is widely argued in the psychology literature that the standard utility functions used in formal economic analyses fail to capture many aspects of individual decision-making. Therefore, identifying the essential modifications to the usual utility functions and incorporating these new elements would enable economists to provide a more realistic representation of agents' preferences and would result in more accurate predictions. Second, there is substantial evidence that incomplete information, together with the imperfect ability to acquire pieces of news, affect the decisions of individuals in systematic ways. Again, characterising the patterns of behaviour in each circumstance is essential to better understand human conduct, and to make predictions on future reactions. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-1999-00175-1.pdf",0,0

518,211542,No,verv: advanced home electricity analytics,"Founded in 2009, Green Running are a fast growth EU SME working with a range of key electricity sector partners (Centrica, UK Power Networks). Having already established a portfolio of commercial and industrial sector electricity analytics tools, in 2014 Green Running began development of a domestic solution -verv.   Verv applies patented machine learning algorithms to detect and profile all sources of electrical activity (generation, storage and consumption) active on a household's electrical system. Generating real time, itemised (iappliance level), usage data across metrics such as energy (kWh), cost (€), environmental impact (tCO2) and power quality (Hz) - verv generates valuable outputs for electricity retailers to customise/extend their services.   With continental Europe subject to many of the same drivers, and several of Green Running's target customers (electricity retailers) active in multiple EU markets, Green Running now seek a H2020 Phase 1 feasibility study to validate verv's pan-European commercial and technical potential. A 5 month project including  market study, proposition refinement, partner engagement, IP strategy management, technology road map updating for multi-market operation and risk management will provide Green Running with the comprehensive knowledge, and partners it requires to first undertake a follow on multi-market field trial, and then launch verv in non-UK markets by 2020. Current projections suggest doing so can boost verv's customer acquisitions by 200%, generate annual revenues of >€6m by 2022 and an operating EBIT of €1.7m supporting creation of 38 new jobs, 23 of which will be high skilled positions at Green Running. >30,000tCO2 are also forecast to be avoided, making a valuable contribution to EU decarbonisation.  This Phase 1 study will accelerate and extend the growth of a high potential EU SME, allowing it to establish Europe's presence in the cutting edge innovation fields of artificial intelligence, and data analytics.",0,0
3,204716,Yes,The New Shape of Family-Related Gender Stratification,"A mountain of evidence fails to account for gender inequalities in employment, earnings and unpaid work predicted by partnership and parenthood, leading scholars to deem the hoped-for gender equality revolution “stalled.” We argue the revolution continues, but pockets of progress are only located when unpacking within-gender differences in effects at individual, couple, and employer levels. This research advances state-of-the-art by revealing how sources and outcomes of gender inequalities predicted by partnership and parenthood vary among women and among men in Finland, Germany, and the UK, three countries with contrasting gender, labor market, and welfare regimes.  The “shape” of family-related gender stratification is mapped in each country through four comparative subprojects answering the following questions:     1) What does variation in partnership or parental bonuses or penalties across women’s and men’s earnings distributions tell us about within-gender differences in the sources of economic inequalities in all three countries?    2) What do within-gender differences in the impact of unpaid domestic work on family-related earnings premiums or penalties in Germany and the UK tell us about the tradeoff between paid and unpaid work effort?  How does the impact of household equity in paid and unpaid work on couple stability vary across the earnings distribution? 3) How does possible British, Finnish, and German employer gender discrimination in hiring vis-à-vis parenthood vary across job skill levels? 4) What is the contribution of employer discrimination to gender-class earnings inequalities predicted by partnership and parenthood in Finland and Germany?    Data include several existing national panel and linked employee-employer panel datasets to be analyzed with cutting-edge fixed-effects semi-parametric techniques, as well as new primary data to be gathered on real-time employer hiring decisions via coordinated field correspondence studies.",1,1
74,196278,No,Whey2Value: valorising waste whey into high-value products,"ACIES BIO has developed an innovative and disruptive high-value technology to address a major economical and environmental challenge of the world’s dairy industry: waste whey. Over 200 million tons of whey is generated annually, and only limited economical solutions exist to process it. The innovative patent pending technology Whey2Value uses a unique bioprocess to utilize whey as a primary ingredient for microbial fermentation to produce sustainable high-value products, such as vitamin B12. The technology greatly reduces the negative impact on the environment by almost eliminating the organic content of the wastewater, allowing for its recycling, while the product of the technology is a protein-rich biomass with high content of vitamin B12 to be used as a very high quality animal feed to complete the dairy industry’s circle. The innovation W2V is perfect example of how circular economy should work. The Whey2Value technology requires a very low-cost processing facility, which can be installed on site, and minimal maintenance costs. It represents a truly unique opportunity to create a huge and disruptive impact on dairy industry, particularly for the competitiveness of small and medium sized European dairy companies, generating high-value products from waste material, and at the same time creating a sustainable solution with a greatly reduced burden to the environment. The objective of this project proposal is to prepare a thorough business plan and feasibility study in the scope of Phase 1, followed by scaling-up and demonstration of operational technology in industrial setting with a local dairy company in the scope of Phase 2. The technology is ready for industrial demonstration, which will be followed by EU and global commercialization of Whey2Value.

266,109777,No,Understanding the physics of first-year sea-ice growth using theoretical and computational fluid dynamics,"'Sea ice provides a dramatic indicator of climate change, and is central to significant feedbacks on climate processes, weather, and polar biogeochemistry. The recently observed imbalance in the annual cycle of winter ice growth and summer melt results in a declining sea ice cover, with first year ice forming a larger fraction of the ice cover instead of the thicker multiyear ice that has been prevalent in the past. Hence, first year ice processes become increasingly important.  This project will advance the state of the art in modelling of physical processes controlling sea ice growth, by applying theoretical and computational fluid dynamics tools to study 2 key elements of first year sea ice growth:  1. Sea ice forms a reactive porous material of ice crystals and liquid brine, allowing fluid transport through the ice and exchange of salt and chemicals with the ocean. We will develop numerical models to directly resolve fluid flow through the interior of a growing ice layer using a continuum theory for multiphase materials. Time-dependent simulations of convection in the ice pore space will yield new insight into brine drainage from sea ice.  2. A significant fraction of Antarctic sea ice has a granular texture, formed by aggregation of ice crystals that grow in turbulent waters below the ocean surface. We will develop novel direct numerical simulations of particle-laden flow with crystal growth and aggregation, to quantify the dynamics of granular ice formation.  The resulting modelling tools, simulation data, and physical insight gained will complement existing observational and experimental data, and provide a basis for developing and evaluating parameterisations for climate prediction and models of sea ice biogeochemistry.  This CIG project will develop a new research team on the fluid dynamics of sea ice processes, and build new collaborations that integrate the modelling work into the wider sea-ice and climate-science communities across Europe and beyond.'",0,0

607,96957,No,Multivariate selection and human-induced environmental stress: adaptive genetic and plastic responses in the yellow dung fly,"One of the main tasks of evolutionary ecology is to characterize and explain the causes of phenotypic variation. Quantifying the relative contribution of genetic and ecological processes and their interaction is also important to predict future response of populations to human-induced environmental changes. The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine whether and to what extent two simultaneously induced new selection pressures are likely to slow or accelerate evolution relative to the case where only one selection pressure is present. In order to achieve this goal, I plan to collect extensive evidence on the nature of multivariate selection, genetic architecture, phenotypic plasticity, and evolutionary potential of Fennoscandian populations of the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria). More specifically, the aims are 1.To compare the intensity and form of natural and sexual selection on fitness components across populations inhabiting six different locations in Fennoscandia 2.To relate the form and intensity of selection in the field with the genetic architecture of traits under selection using a laboratory quantitative genetic experiment 3.To examine changes in the potential for evolutionary responses to selection as a function of the number and intensity of stresses using a genotype by environment interaction experiment 4.To develop, parameterize and analyze a model of population and evolutionary dynamics under different predicted future environmental scenarios focusing on realistic description of ecological and genetic processes describing individual growth, survival and fitness",0,0
578,226060,No,Cohesion in further developing and innovating SHARE across all 28 member countries,"SHARE, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, is a research infrastructure to better understand and cope with the challenges and chances of population ageing. The main objective of SHARE is to provide excellent data for aging research through a combination of (a) transdisciplinarity, (b) longitudinality and (c) European coverage with strict cross-national comparability through ex-ante harmonisation. With its recent seventh wave, SHARE succeeded in covering all EU member states in cooperation with the British Isles Surveys (UK and Ireland). The coverage of all EU member states (plus Switzerland and Israel) is particularly attractive for both scientific and Commission users because it permits cross-national comparisons of the economic, health and social situation of EU citizens aged 50 and over and allows for comparative evaluations of aging-related policies such as pension, health and long-term care reforms.

502,216131,No,"Continuity and Rupture in Central European Art and Architecture, 1918-1939","When new political elites and social structures emerge out of a historical rupture, how are art and architecture affected? In 1918 the political map of central Europe was redrawn as a result of the collapse of Austria-Hungary, marking a new era for the region. Through comparative analysis of the visual arts in 3 states built on the ruins of the Habsburg Empire (Austria, Hungary and [former] Czechoslovakia), this project examines how such political discontinuity affected art and architecture between 1918 and 1939. The project is organised into 4 themes, each resulting in a monograph:  1. Vernacular modernisms, nostalgia and the avant-garde 2. Presenting the state: world fairs and exhibitionary cultures  3. Piety, reaction and renewal 4. Contested histories: monuments, memory and representations of the historical past   It is the first systematic and comprehensive trans-national study of this type, based on the claim that the successor states to Austria-Hungary belonged to a common cultural space informed by the shared memory of the long years of Habsburg society and culture. The project focuses on the contradictory ways that visual arts of artists and architects in central Europe adapted to and tried to shape new socio-political circumstances in the light of the past. The project thus examines the long shadow of the Habsburg Empire over the art and culture of the twentieth century.    The project also considers the impact of the political and ideological imperatives of the three successor states on the visual arts; how did governments treat the past? Did they encourage a sense of historical caesura or look to the past for legitimation? How did artists and architects respond to such new impulses? In answering these questions the project analyses the conflicts between avant-gardes and more conservative artistic movements; the role of the visual arts in interwar memory politics; the place of art in the nexus of religion, national and state identity.",0,0

The IPC-PAS has a strong research record in both fundamental studies of physiochemical processes as well as application oriented research. The use and control of nanostructured materials is of great importance for the development of new environmentally friendly materials, more efficient energy-sources and biosensors for medical analysis. The NOBLESSE project will bring essential equipment to the institute, but also help create a Polish nanoscience network to survey the major equipment at Polish research centres and make sure that necessary equipment is available to the researchers. This will be an important development not only for IPC-PAS but for Polish nanoscience as a whole. A major part of the NOBLESSE project is reinforcing the research potential of the Institute by bringing in new experienced researchers and strengthening the staff through a number of supporting activities such as training programs, networking, improvements in dissemination and collaboration with industry. The most important part of fully integrating the IPC-PAS into the ERA community is the establishment of strong partnerships with mutual staff secondments with a network of leading EU research centres sharing scientific interests. This will lead to a large contact area, promoting the Institute and further integrating its staff into EU projects and international collaboration. The planned activities within NOBLESSE will firmly position IPC-PAS as a leading research centre on a national level, contribute to preventing brain drain by offering young devoted researchers competitive resources and facilitate the exchange of know-how with the wider scientific community but equally important with the public and potential business partners.

704,193315,No,Breast Cancer Risk after Diagnostic Gene Sequencing (BRIDGES),"Breast cancer affects more than 360,000 women per year in the EU and causes more than 90,000 deaths. Identification of women at high risk of the disease can lead to disease prevention through intensive screening, chemoprevention or prophylactic surgery. Breast cancer risk is determined by a combination of genetic and lifestyle risk factors. The advent of next generation sequencing has opened up the opportunity for testing in many disease genes, and diagnostic gene panel testing is being introduced in many EU countries. However, the cancer risks associated with most variants in most genes are unknown. This leads to a major problem in appropriate counselling and management of women undergoing panel testing. In this project, we aim to build a knowledge base that will allow identification of women at high-risk of breast cancer, in particular through comprehensive evaluation of  DNA variants in known and suspected breast cancer genes. We will exploit the huge resources established through the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles). We will expand the existing datasets by sequencing all known breast cancer susceptibility genes in 20,000 breast cancer cases and 20,000 controls from population-based studies, and 10,000 cases from multiple case families.  Sequence data will be integrated with in-silico and functional data, with data on other known risk factors, to generate a comprehensive risk model that can provide personalised risk estimates. We will develop online tools to aid the interpretation of gene variants and provide risk estimates in a user-friendly format, to help genetic counsellors and patients worldwide to make informed clinical decisions. We will evaluate the acceptability and utility of comprehensive gene panel testing in the clinical genetics context.",0,0

191,212253,No,Deciphering the Molecular Foundations and Functional Competence of Alternative Human Naïve Pluripotent Stem Cells,"An important goal of stem cell therapy is to create “customized” cells that are genetically identical to the patient, which upon transplantation can restore damaged tissues. Such cells can be obtained by in vitro direct reprogramming of somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This approach also opens possibilities for modelling human diseases in vitro. However, major hurdles remain that restrain fulfilling conventional human iPSC/ESC potential, as they reside in an advanced primed pluripotent state. Such hurdles include limited differentiation capacity and functional variability. Further, in vitro iPSC based research platforms are simplistic and iPSC based “humanized” chimeric mouse models may be of great benefit.  The recent isolation of distinct and new “mouse-like” naive pluripotent states in humans that correspond to earlier embryonic developmental state(s), constitutes a paradigm shift and may alleviate limitations of conventional primed iPSCs/ESCs. Thus, our proposal aims at dissecting the human naïve pluripotent state(s) and to unveil pathways that facilitate their unique identity and flexible programming.  Specific goals: 1) Transcriptional and Epigenetic Design Principles of Human Naïve Pluripotency 2) Signalling Principles Governing Human Naïve Pluripotency Maintenance and Differentiation 3) Defining Functional Competence and Safety of Human Naïve Pluripotent Stem Cells in vitro 4) Novel human naïve iPSC based cross-species chimeric mice for studying human differentiation and disease modelling in vivo. These aims will be conducted by utilizing engineered human iPSC/ESC models, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screening, advanced microscopy and ex-vivo whole embryo culture methods. Our goals will synergistically lead to the design of strategies that will accelerate the safe medical application of human naive pluripotent stem cells and their use in disease specific modelling and applied stem cell research.",0,0
943,194592,No,The Choice for Europe since Maastricht. Member States' Preferences for Economic and Financial Integration,"The Eurozone crisis corroborated the warnings of economists that weak economic policy coordination and loose fiscal oversight would be insufficient to stabilise the monetary union. To prevent a recurrence of the crisis, economists, political actors and the “Blueprint” of the European Commission are asking for the construction of a deep and genuine economic and monetary union with reinforced governance architecture – beyond the recently adopted mechanisms. Many models of a fiscal union have been proposed and discussed. What is missing are not ideas and economic analysis, but the political consensus among member states’ governments for a specific integration path. Therefore, this political science project analyses the politics of economic and fiscal integration, that is, the conflict structure among member states. To this end, we aim to study the preferences of member states’ governments’ for different models of a fiscal union. Our theoretical framework builds on the comparative political economy literature and liberal intergovernmentalism and argues that domestic economic, fiscal and political factors are the main determinants of member states’ preferences. To empirically study the extent to which governments’ preferences are shaped by these factors, we propose to conduct 165 semi-structured interviews with decision makers in all member states. The interview data will be analysed with a mixed-method strategy – including quantitative analysis as well as case studies. We fully expect that the findings of the project will provide guidance for the successful implementation of a feasible reform of the governance architecture of the EU to the effective stabilisation of the economy. In addition to the political feasibility analysis, we aim to study the legal context of potential integration scenarios. The consortium conducting this research covers all regions of the EU and consists of 8 distinguished political scientists and one legal scholar.",0,0
154,197480,No,Computational Biophotonics for Endoscopic Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy,"Key challenges in endoscopic tumor diagnosis and therapy consist of the detection and discrimination of malignant tissue as well as the precise navigation of medical instruments. Currently, a low level of sensitivity and specificity in tumor detection and lack of global orientation lead to both over- and undertreatment, tumor recurrence, intra-operative complications, and high costs. The goal of this multidisciplinary project is to revolutionize clinical endoscopic imaging based on the systematic integration of two new but independant fields of research up until this point: Biophotonics and computer-assisted interventions (COMputational BIOphotonics in endoSCOPY).  For the first time, quantitative multi-modal imaging biomarkers based on structural and functional data are being developed to enhance the physician’s view by providing information that cannot be seen with the naked eye. To this extent, white light images co-registered with multispectral optical and photoacoustic images will be processed in a combined manner to dynamically reconstruct not only the visible surface in 3D but also subsurface anatomical and functional detail such as 3D vessel topology, blood volume and oxygenation. Spatio-temporal registration of multi-modal data acquired before and during the procedure will enable (1) the highly specific local tissue classification and discrimination based on tissue shape, texture, function and radiological contrast imagery as well as (2) global context-aware instrument guidance.  This innovative approach to radiation-free real-time imaging will be implemented and evaluated by means of computer-assisted colonoscopy and laparoscopy. The potential socioeconomic impact of providing high precision minimally-invasive tumor diagnosis and therapy at low cost is extremely high.",0,0
22,80889,Yes,The structures of civil society governance in promoting rural development (on the example of East Germany and Ukraine),"The development of rural areas is becoming an increasingly relevant political issue both in East Germany and Ukraine. The effectiveness of rural development policies can be maximised only when they are supported by strong bottom-up (grassroots) initiatives, represented by civil society organisations in rural areas. The idea of the project is to view various methods to promote rural development, involving the use of governments, markets, and civil society organisations, as governance structures differing in their appropriateness for various specific rural development problems.  The project will be aimed at determining the comparative effectiveness of these governance structures for promoting rural development, with particular emphasis on the structural types o f civil society governance. The conceptual innovativeness of the project lies therefore in the integration between economics of rural development in transition and the theory of economic organisation.  The specific objectives of research are 1) theoretical analysis of civil society governance; 2) evaluation of the potential of using the civil society governance for rural development purposes in each covered country; 3) development of recommendations for action for the key stakeholders of rural development.  The major methods to be used include: literature study, case studies of civil society governance in East Germany and Ukraine, surveys, development of spreadsheet tools. The applicant is currently a post-doctoral student at the Institute for Agricultural Economics, Kiev, Ukraine. The realisation of the proposed project at the Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO) in Halle, Germany, will help the applicant to strengthen his competences and enhance his career perspectives, since the proposal is aimed at a highly politically relevant field of research. The topic of the project corresponds to research interests of both Institute for Agricultural Economics in Ukraine and IAMO.",0,1
648,90575,No,"Molecular, cellular and metabolic neuronal pathways of Fragile X Syndrome","Mental retardation (MR) is a major cause of serious handicap, as well as an important medical and social issue, affecting 2-3% of the population. The Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent hereditary cause of MR affecting 1/4000 males and 1/7000 females, due to the inactivation of the X-linked Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 gene (FMR1). In FXS patients and the Fmr1 knock-out mouse, the lack of the gene product, the RNA-binding protein FMRP, induces behavioural and cognitive abnormalities, coupled to alterations of synaptic plasticity and morphology, most probably due to alterations of the transport and localized synaptic translation of specific mRNA targets of FMRP. To better understand the role played by FMRP in this processes, I propose to first systematically identify the mRNA specifically targeted by FMRP in RNA granules, the mRNP particles that transport mRNA towards the synapse, using a transcriptomic approach. In addition, I will identify the protein partners of FMRP in the neuronal RNA granules, using mass-spec analysis of the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with FMRP in biochemical preparations of RNA granules. Finally, I will use proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) and multivariate pattern recognition to characterize the neurochemical perturbations and define a metabolic signature of FXS in Fmr1 KO mice, that will further enable a pharmaco-metabonomic study of FXS treatment efficacy. This project will essentially be developed at the IPMC, in Dr Bardoni's laboratory (Aim 1 and 2) but also in close collaboration with a Canadian laboratory (Prof. Khandjian, Univ. Laval, Québec) and with a French laboratory (Aim 3, Dr Dumas, ENS Lyon) and. By integrating the molecular and metabolic data obtained following this trans-disciplinary approach, I expect to contribute significantly to the understanding of the neuronal alterations induced by the absence of FMRP in FXS patients, and to validate therapeutical molecules.",0,0

The project will enhance and support regional smart specialization and development by increasing research capacity, effective mobility of young innovators/researchers and shared knowledge to improve their participation in the EU research area. It will contribute to the establishment of favorable and stable conditions for international cooperation and the set-up of a Common Knowledge and Innovation Space of specialization in the SMN for a real socio-economic impact, based on co-ownership and mutual benefits. Our partnership ensures coherence and complementarity with past and on-going regional EU-MPC cooperation initiatives and existing bilateral S&T Agreements. The project allows easily building of synergies among several ongoing initiatives thanks to the established Think Tanks Network of Science Counselors in the MPC area and the observatory of current initiatives. In this way, the project will seek continuous complementarity and coherence with the activities of the Strategic Forum for International Cooperation to enhance the cooperation and close synergies through the involvement of the widest possible range of stakeholders, from funding agencies, research organizations, industry to civil society. Therefore an enhanced and more reliable definition of the priority setting mechanisms in the region from an innovation point of view is expected.

126,31317,No,"Technology, economic integration and social cohesion","The project will provide insight into the impact of several important and interrelated developments on social cohesion and exclusion in the European Union.  The issues that will be analyzed are:   - Technological change as the single most important factor shaping the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the fundamental economic factors influencing social cohesion, such as employment and economic growth;  - Globalisation, broadly driven by technology (e.g. telematics) and by the liberalisation and deregulation of trade and capital flows. This globalisation trend leads to qualitative changes in the form and effects of the exposure of countries to foreign competition, not only in the form of trade, but also through increased foreign direct investment flows.   Several working papers and a policy-oriented report will attempt to make a significant impact on 'public opinion' within the group of policy-makers and policy-analysts.",1,0
800,98577,No,Plant biodiversity of China in a changing world: evolution and conservation,"'What determines large-scale patterns of species richness remains one of the oldest unresolved questions in biology. A plethora of hypotheses have been proposed to explain such patterns, most of which focus on the effects of contemporary processes and environment, especially those associated with climate. A current challenge for ecologists is to link the effect of such contemporary factors with factors associated with the evolutionary history of a region and its species.  By combining novel methods in macroecology with species distribution modeling in an integrated framework, I will explore the geographical patterns in species richness and associated phylogenetic structures using high-quality data of plant distributions and phylogenetic information. Additionally, I will determine the threats to plant biodiversity caused by global change in climate. Based on the identification of hotspots of evolutionary history and global changes, I will evaluate the efficiency of the nature reserve network in China.  My research will focus on eastern Asia using information on 11,405 species of woody plants. This large biogeographical region contains steep spatial variation in diversity and climate, making it immensely suitable for testing hypotheses proposed to explain species richness patterns. It is a region that has yet to be rigorously investigated using high quality data. Thus, knowledge from this project will compliment the many related studies based on European and North American data, thereby facilitating a more global overview on these issue.  I will be supervised by Prof. Carsten Rahbek, a leading scientist of macroecology and global change ecology, and hosted by the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, a Center of Excellence at the Univ. of Copenhagen, Denmark. The proposed project, PDIVCHINA, will substantially improve my scientific competencies by providing multidisciplinary knowledge and advanced training for complementary scientific skills.'",0,0
555,211662,No,Integrated nanoparticle isolation and detection system for complete on-chip analysis of exosomes,"The aim of Project INDEX is to isolate and characterize nanoparticles available in bodily fluids through development and integration of novel technological breakthroughs. The technology will enable the analysis of clinically valuable nanoparticles called exosomes towards new generation diagnostics. Exosomes are known to mediate communication between cells and their effective utilization holds a great promise of revolutionizing the standard of clinical care. However, their detection and molecular profiling is technically challenging. The proposed technology will isolate exosomes that are as small as 30nm in diameter from human plasma with high purity, and provide in-depth, multi-parameter characterization of the particles through digital counting, size determination, and biological phenotyping.  Towards this goal: (1) Novel microfluidics will be developed and used for efficient magnetic enrichment; (2) Isolated particles will be detected and analyzed with a novel biological nanoparticle (BNP) sensor (3) Immune-capture and release chemistries as well as phenotyping assays will be developed; (4) Critically, complete on-chip integration of isolation, detection and analysis will be accomplished; (5) Utility of in-depth exosome characterization will be demonstrated with clinical samples for lung cancer.  Project INDEX requires successful integration of multiple sub-units and assays that each represents technological frontiers, which is extremely challenging. However, the breadth of information on exosomes that will be available with the integrated system is unmatched. Although, the clinical utility of exosomes is still developing, the uncertainty can only be clarified through automated technologies that provide latitude of information. Once completed, Project INDEX can demonstrate a new paradigm in cancer diagnostics, and also present a potential future technology for other applications involving nanoparticles.",0,0
980,220318,No,"Social Networks of the Past: Mapping Hispanic and Lusophone Literary Modernity, 1898-1959","Data mining and big data approaches are changing the ways in which we create knowledge, access information and preserve our cultural heritage. This research applies cutting-edge technology to analyse a neglected aspect of European and non-European social and cultural life of the 20th century: the impact of Hispanic and Lusophone literary networks and cultural mediators in international modernity between 1898 and 1959. The project pursues three central goals: 1) to retrieve the lost history of Iberoamerican mediators in modernist intercultural and multilingual networks and reappraise their role; 2) to narrow the knowledge divide in terms of access and production in the Iberoamerican field by generating and making freely available new and reliable data that addresses the lack of documented cultural heritage, and 3) to offer an innovative and reproducible model that can be applied across periods, languages, and disciplines to analyse cross-border phenomena, under-examined mediators and networks and overshadowed geographical scales in their relations to the wider world. These goals will be achieved by a twofold methodology: i) an open and collaborative research tool providing a data source for quantitative and qualitative analysis on Iberoamerican mediators, and ii) four subprojects on key cultural transformation processes distinctive of modern societies (the institutionalization of Iberoamerican cultures, the rise of translated literature in key Iberoamerican modernist journals, the position of Iberoamerican women in the cultural field, and the role of Iberoamerican mediators in new forms of mass media). By combining computational methods, cultural, literary history, translation, sociology, gender and media studies, I will lead an interdisciplinary team of 6 researchers that will fill the gap in modernist studies and will offer an original, reproducible and empirically tested method for studying social human interaction within a global, cultural and decentred approach",0,0
897,59406,No,Global Riemannian Geometry: curvature and topology,"Global Riemannian Geometry is a branch of Riemannian Geometry that has experimented a great development along this century, evolving a wide range of techniques and sub-disciplines, as critical point theory, distance geometry and comparison geometry. Its main goal consists into the topological (or even metrical) classification of manifolds satisfying some restrictions on its curvatures or other Riemannian invariants defined on it. That is, the relationships between topology and geometry of a given manifold. In some cases even the geometry can be recognised via measurements of metric invariants. The aim of this course is to present young researchers some of these techniques in order to prepare them for the research in this area. In particular, the course will be focused on a combination of the following topics: finite metric spaces, distance geometry, analysis on smooth and discrete spaces and comparison geometry via Cartan connections. The theory of Cartan connexions gives a global vision of differential geometry and classical geometries, and this gives a great interest to this course because these tools will be useful everywhere. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-2000-00024-1.pdf",0,0
896,191381,No,Arylation and Vinylation of Enolates: New Reactivity from the Urea Linkage,"Enols and enolates are among the most versatile nucleophiles in chemistry: they react well with alkylating agents or carbonyl compounds, but their coupling with aryl or alkenyl halides is usually dependent on Pd-based catalysts for enol–aryl coupling. In this proposal we aim to develop new possibilities for enolate arylation that reveal fundamental new reactivity and will have repercussions throughout the science of synthetic planning. The method builds on some arylation reactions of urea-containing organolithiums, first reported in 2007, which turn out to be general for a variety of compound classes. Preliminary experiments show that enolates also undergo this arylation, providing a simple way of introducing an Ar\ equivalent to an enolate nucleophile without the need for heavy-metal catalysis. We propose to develop this reaction into a simple and versatile method for the challenging arylation of enolates. The resulting transformation will have broad application to the synthesis of biologically active targets, both natural and non-natural, of value to the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and related fine chemicals industries. Extension beyond the amino acids could see the method rooted among the canon of enolate-based C–C bond forming reactions.  Key objectives are: • Arylation and vinylation of amino acids: We will optimise the enolate methodology for the synthesis of quaternary amino acid targets. • Controlling absolute configuration: We will develop an asymmetric version of the reaction (ideally based on chiral metal ligands, but alternatively other structures) for the enantioselective synthesis of quaternary amino acids. • Mechanistic investigation: Unravelling the remarkable mechanism of the reaction will throw light on other possible future directions for the research. • Extending to other carboxylic acid derivatives. • Arylation and vinylation of ketones and aldehydes. • Synthesis of valuable target molecules.",0,0
696,215247,No,A principal-based EU challenge to East Central European judicial interpretation of constitutional identity,"The overall aim of the research is to provide a new theoretical basis for a principle-based EU challenge to the domestic judicial interpretations of constitutional identity. It is of utmost importance, because East Central European courts apply an ethno-cultural understanding of identity, thereby putting European integration in peril. Although the EU is clearly committed to shared values and principles, Article 4(2) of the Treaty on European Union  emphasizes that “the Union shall respect the national identities of the Member States”. Due to the recent migration flow, the Member States are currently attempting to define themselves and offer a legal definition of identity. However, East Central European Member States, by labeling national identity as constitutional identity, apply Article 4(2) as a means of derogating from some of their obligations under EU law. Despite the vast literature available on national identity and its role in EU law, there has been little attention paid to the recently emerging trend of judicial reinvention of identity in East Central Europe. This is what this research offers. It focuses on the Visegrád Group (V4), which consists of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The V4 countries are united in their views on rejecting migrant relocation quotas in the EU and define their exclusionary constitutional identities accordingly. The main subject of the research is the relevant case law of the constitutional courts, since the V4 courts have an authoritative role in enforcing nation-state policies based upon ethno-cultural considerations. The project provides a new theoretical basis and a comparative-analytical description of the judicial interpretations of constitutional identity in the V4 countries based on which we can better understand the recent East Central European trend of disintegration. Furthermore, the results provide a principal-based tool for an EU challenge to the judicial interpretations of constitutional identity.",0,0
50,106747,Yes,Socioeconomic Status and Health: Disentangling causal pathways in a life course perspective,"People with lower income or lower educational level have worse health and higher mortality. This project addresses the two basic underlying questions for this finding: How does your socioeconomic status determine your health? And how does your health determine your socioeconomic status? The project aims at studying life courses of persons aged 50\ at the time of the interview who were surveyed prospectively, and also retrospectively for their entire life history starting at childhood. We will use data from the Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from 30,000 individuals in 14 European countries, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) that offers the same data for more than 7,000 persons. This data contains exact information on periods and events of ill health and periods and events of change in socioeconomic status. In addition, there is explicit information on the consequences of poor health in childhood in terms of schooling, or, later in life, in terms of working hours or career perspectives. Life histories from childhood to old age are the ideal basis for disentangling causality between SES and health because confounding of the key variables prior to measurement is minimal. By applying simultaneous equation models for hazards (survival analysis) the correlated processes of health deterioration (influenced by SES) and the development of SES (influenced by health) can be disentangled. This will produce unbiased estimates of the effect sizes for both causation directions and answer the question of causation and selection in a life course perspective taking into account endogeneity and confounders. We will also reveal if common background factors are influencing both SES and health and we will identify possible differences in the causation direction between life stages. This study will provide important new insight into the dual relationship between SES and health and will help to understand and to tackle social differences in health.",1,1
107,91908,No,Talent and Learning in Imperfect Markets,"The overall effectiveness at which the underlying talent resources in an economy are utilized is an important determinant of long-run economic growth and well-being. Recent work has shown that the processes through which talent is discovered and revealed in the economy are likely to suffer from market imperfections that are analogous to problems that have been for long been understood in the context of private provision of job training and education, resulting in not just reduced economic efficiency but also contributing to income inequality. The first basic question is what is the role of talent rents in explaining income inequality? In a static world where all information about talent is known, such talent rents would merely be compensation to a scarce factor of production. However, when the discovery of talent is subject to market imperfections then income differences that ostensibly look like talent rents are partly due to inefficient information rents. This raises the second and novel question, about whether and to what extent observed income differences are due to inefficient rents to information about talent that masquerade as talent rents. I also plan to investigate how technological change has impacted the distribution of talent rents via its effect on the discovery/revelation process of talent. The larger goal of the project is to help understand the economy-wide implications of institutions and policies that govern the discovery and allocation of talent in the economy. Better understanding could also point the way towards improved policy interventions.",0,0
138,195599,No,"The ‘other’ Europe: the formation and development of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), 1958–92","Debates over the type and degree of integration pursued by European states currently dominate the European Union (EU). As the gulf between proponents and critics of the ‘Community method’ grows more acute, as the EU environment increasingly revolves around interstate relations, and as scenarios of EU ‘disintegration’ are entertained at various levels, attention has focused on historical precedents of intergovernmental models of cooperation in the hope of foreseeing the EU’s future development. Such debates have aroused notable interest in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the principal ‘other’ in postwar European politics. Yet very little is known about how and why EFTA developed in the way it did, its institutional and policy-making structure or the implications of these aspects for the present-day EU. The current state-of-the-art suffers two particular limitations: (i) it concentrates on very short time periods and (ii) it presents a highly state-centric realist account of EFTA’s history. This project fills this gap by undertaking a detailed historical study of EFTA’s development. It aims to (i) examine EFTA’s growth over a sustained period (1958–92) and (ii) account for this evolution as a product of interplay between actors at the national, transnational and institutional levels. Methodologically, the project deploys an innovative interdisciplinary approach that embeds historical research in the multi-level governance concept borrowed from political science. Empirically, the project draws on EFTA’s hitherto underexplored archives in Geneva and the national collections of its various member states. Historiographically, it promises new insights into EFTA history and reconnects the organisation’s and its members’ historical narrative to studies of European integration that generally focus more on the denser pre-history of the EU. In so doing, the project adds significantly to both research in the European Research Area and the priorities of Horizon 2020.",0,0
659,78638,No,Job Mobilities and Family Lives in Europe Modern Mobile Living and its Relation to Quality of Life,"The considerable rate of global social, economic, political, and demographic changes leads to increasing demands on mobility and flexibility of persons and institutions. As a consequence, new patterns of contingency and constancy, movement and integration, work and family are emerging. An extended mobility of employees is both a requirement and a precondition of the knowledge-based society and essential for social and territorial cohesion in Europe.  One of the key challenges Europe faces in this situation is to understand how to encourage the flow of people and ideas across Europe without creating impairments regarding family formation, social integration, and individual well being. To improve this understanding is the main objective of this comparative research, covering six comprehensively selected European countries: both old and new EU members, and an associated country, representing varying levels of economic development, demographic situation, social environments, and cultural traditions.  The study is targeted at: - mapping the demands and potentials of job mobility across selected regions, and identifying the barriers and triggers influencing the readiness to become mobile - identifying the consequences of job mobility for family formation (marriage, fertility, divorce), family relations (child care, coping, conflict management, division of labour), social integration, and individual well being - assessing the gender-specific issues in the field of mobility with a special focus on women, as our previous research suggests the costs of job mobility are higher for women - developing suggestions for adequate political measures to advance quality of life of mobile employees and their families in Europe, and balancing demands against readiness to move.  The theoretical conception will be based on a dynamic social-structural approach on the macro-level, combined with a rational-choice approach and stress theory on the micro-level of acting people.",0,0

Later childbearing and ART has been associated with an increased risk of the epigenetic disorders in offspring. Thus, in order to guarantee better and safer healthcare for EU citizens, risks and benefits of the use of various ART procedures needs to be thoughtfully tested. The project aims at overcoming the existing gaps and strengthening our capacity in Epigenetic Risk Assessment of Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ERA of ART). Long term GOAL of our project is to become the European Centre of Excellence and Innovation for Epigenetic Risk Assessment of ART. To do this, we will create link between IGAB PAS, providing high quality know-how in mouse embryology with University of Wuerzburg (leader in epigenetic assessment of ART embryos), with University of Teramo (having long-standing expertise in wide range of ART procedures in large animals) and with Uniwersytet Jagiellonski (having  long-standing expertise in human genetics).

383,35870,No,Blue European semiconductor laser,"The objective of the project is to develop for European semiconductor industry long-lived blue-emitting II-VI quantum well laser diodes which utilise novel approaches to the growth and design of the semiconductor structure to achieve a performance which will surpass that of current Japanese devices.    In order for the green-blue II-VI laser diodes to reach the stage of commercialisation, some basic problems must be solved. To tackle these obstacles, we propose that the novel 'inverted' doping structures for green-blue lasers developed at Tampere University of Technology, would be assessed and evaluated in the first phase of this project. These new structures, if found to be superior to the more conventional ones, will have the advantage of overcoming one of the three major problems concerning green-blue laser development, namely decreasing considerably the contact region degradation. The two remaining major subjects of study, the defect formation during growth and operation of the device and efficient p-doping of ZnSe based compounds, will be addressed as described in detail in the workplan. It should be emphasised that the work to be completed on these two latter topics will also be of relevance for normal structures, not only 'inverted' ones.   Combining these three methods, together with general improvements in quality of the component II-VI materials, offers the most promising approach which can be conceived at the present time to achieve a breakthrough in the development of high quality II-VI lasers. Achievement of this breakthrough is the primary aim of this Consortium; it will have tremendous commercial impact.  The work to be completed under this project comprises a series of iterations from manufacturing through structural analysis to electrical analysis and lifetime testing. Each of these tasks is to be completed at a site with the most relevant expertise among the partners. Thus clearly this exercise would not be successful without the contributions from all partners involved; in this proposed project we have assembled a team with the breadth and depth of expertise necessary to explore these ideas quickly and effectively in a European context.",0,0
992,82421,No,Elucidating the ORIGINS of Solar System(s): Anatomy of primitive meteorites,"This proposal seeks to better understand the origins of our planetary system, and of exo-planetary systems beyond. Carbonaceous chondrites (CC) and samples from the recently returned Stardust mission are amongst the most primitive materials available to us.  The components that constitute these rocks formed in the early solar system, and are the likely building blocks of planets. We will perform orbital studies of CC to identify their source regions within the Solar System, providing us with a spatial context to interpret their composition. We will define the chemistry, mineralogy, geochemistry and isotopic composition of these building blocks. Coupled with experimental work, these studies will clarify the relationship of CC and Stardust constituents to each other, their formation mechanisms, and define the physical and chemical conditions in the pre-terrestrial environment, and the astrophysical environment of the early sun.  The picture of our Solar System that will emerge from our study will be used as a touchstone to better understand the formation of the Earth, as well as dusty disks around other stars and the probable abundance and composition of newly discovered exo-planets. These objectives can be achieved thanks to the multidisciplinary team we brought together, to the quality of our instrumentation, and to our ability to tackle both theoretical and analytical problems. The proposed collaboration will generate a European network of young researchers in the field of space and solar system sciences. They will form the core of a technically competent, multi-skilled generation of cosmo-chemists, cosmic-mineralogists and astrophysicists able to significantly support/contribute to a 'Golden Era of European Space Exploration', in which ESA and other organisations are already deeply involved.

New drugs and new targets are needed to combat MDR-TB. A critical feature of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus is its ability to survive and even replicate within macrophages, making these host cells an ideal niche for persisting microbes. The goal of our project is to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the persistence of intracellular mycobacteria and to develop novel approaches to eradicate the bacillus from its hiding spot. To this end, we have been undertaking global approaches using visual phenotypic assays (relying on monitoring by automated confocal fluorescence microscopy) of the trafficking and replication of M. tuberculosis inside macrophages. Screening of a small interfering RNA library, a M. tuberculosis transposon mutant library and hundreds of thousands of small chemical molecules has led to the identification of key host and mycobacterial genes involved in the intracellular fate of M. tuberculosis, as well as chemicals able to prevent intracellular bacterial growth. Building on the considerable data generated and on the powerful high throughput / high content (HT/HC) confocal microscopy, our project is to further explore the signalling pathways used specifically by M. tuberculosis. We will focus on the in depth study of bacterial protein effectors belonging to the ESX and PPE families and of the SOCS family member CISH, which promotes intracellular mycobacterial survival. Finally, chemicals that target cellular partners of M. tuberculosis will constitute a new starting point for the development of drugs able to counteract this host response manipulation without directly targeting the pathogen, thereby overcoming the issue of the emergence of MDR-TB.",0,0
481,209244,No,Post-crisis urban governance transformations in Southern Europe: a comparativist approach,"The post-crisis transformations of the socio-political landscapes in Southern Europe have shaped crucial opportunities for emergent political actors and the civil society to introduce new governance mechanisms. Following a turbulent period of social mobilizations, rapid political and institutional transformations are underway at the city, regional and national levels in countries such as Spain and Greece, and particularly in Madrid and Athens. These provide a crucial theoretical, methodological and analytical challenge for urban studies and a key opportunity for the development of a novel relational comparative approach regarding the modifications of urban governance in Madrid and Athens. The prime research aim of URBANiTE is to investigate the ongoing socio-political developments in the two cities, the relationship between civil society and emergent political actors and the ways these shape institutional changes. The project will produce context-sensitive, innovative outcomes on multi-level territorial governance, of high relevance for science, society and policy, in times of sweeping challenges in Europe and beyond. Moreover, it involves integrated interdisciplinary research with policy implications for the governance of inclusive, innovative and reflective societies, hence fully responds to challenges set out in the Horizon 2020 Societal challenges programme. The Fellowship will provide opportunity for knowledge exchange, as the fellow will bring expertise from the UK and Greece on urban politics, citizenship and grassroots social innovation in austerity contexts. It will also allow the fellow to advance her knowledge in an interdisciplinary research environment and learn from a new regional context, which will contribute to greater understandings of urban governance changes, social innovation and policy implementation in contemporary Europe. Lessons generated will be of wider relevance for EU- level urban governance, with transferable outcomes to other contexts.",0,0
660,214700,No,Women’s cancers: do variations in patterns of care explain the world-wide inequalities in survival and avoidable premature deaths?,"Opening the World Cancer Congress in Paris in November 2016, President François Hollande insisted that women should be at the heart of cancer control, “because they are victims of inequality in access to prevention, treatment and screening in every country in the world.”   Breast, ovarian and cervical cancers are a major public health problem world-wide. Each year, approximately 2.5 million women are diagnosed with one of these cancers, and 900,000 women die from them, mainly in low- and middle-income countries.  The CONCORD programme for global surveillance of cancer survival reported striking differences in survival from these three cancers. Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of health systems in dealing with cancer, from early diagnosis to comprehensive investigation and optimal treatment. I will exploit the CONCORD data base, as follows:   • Access primary medical records in selected high- and low-income countries to collect more detailed data on stage at diagnosis, staging investigations, morphology, grade, prognostic bio-markers and treatment, for the most recent year during 2010-2014 for which data are available • Analyse the distributions of stage and treatment (“patterns of care”) • Estimate 1- and 5-year survival trends by stage, histological group and/or molecular subtype • Quantify inequalities in survival as the number of premature deaths that would be avoidable if survival in a given country (region) were equal to that in a neighbouring country with higher survival.   This ground-breaking work will show that it is possible (a) to collect high-quality, complete clinical information at population level even in low- and middle-income countries; (b) to explain the striking inequalities in women’s cancer survival world-wide, and (c) to summarise these inequalities in a single number (avoidable deaths) as a powerful tool that motivates policymakers to reduce inequalities in survival.",0,0
451,47653,No,A novel marine pharmaceutical with unique mechanism of action for t he treatment of cancer,"Objectives : The primary objective of this demonstration project is to verify the anticancer clinical activity of Ecteinascidin-743 (ET-743), a new marine entity harbouring a novel mechanism of action. Clinical activity will be verified against six solid malignant tumor types for which available therapies have no or limited effects.  The selected tumor types are melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and prostate cancer. The clinical plan has been implemented on the basis of results emerging from appropriate experimental models which show ET-743 to be highly potent with a unique profile of activity when compared to standard anticancer agents. Mechanism studies have identified ET-743 as a novel DNA interacting agent, acting at the minor groove with specificity for guanine rich regions. It is therefore expected that this novel mechanism of action may be translated into a novel spectrum of anticancer activity. The studies will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice guidelines with separate clinical protocols for each tumor type. The number of patients to be entered in the studies is defined by the statistical requirements to verify the tumor response rate. The project milestones are based on the statistical analysis for each tumor type. On verification of activity in the early studies, further confirmatory studies are carried out. The clinical studies will involve three partners which provide a balance between the pharmaceutical industry and innovative clinical research units. The partners are structured to provide European wide involvement which ensures rapid evaluation while retaining strict logistical management to ensure the results are to regulatory standards. The partnership also ensures that the use of the compound is exposed to prominent members of the medical oncology community as well as to the European regulatory authorities.  The compound is fully covered by patent (until the year 2007 in Europe) and supplies are readily available to conduct clinical studies. The economic effect of the project includes the rapid evaluation of a potentially new anticancer agent minimising the time to market with additional benefit to the European biotechnology industry. The social implication is the availability of an additional therapy for the treatment of life threatening cancers which may improve quality of life in cancer patients as well as providing potential benefits in reducing costs in the healthcare system.",0,0
453,111392,No,"Financial Distortions and Macroeconomic Performance: Expectations, Constraints and Interaction of Agents","The ability of financial markets to bear risk is central to economic welfare and stability. Growth and economic wellbeing is inhibited if financial markets are unable to transfer resources efficiently from the suppliers of liquidity to entrepreneurs. However, this proper functioning of financial markets has been distorted by levels of volatility considerably in excess of those implied by fundamentals. Markets have undergone dramatic crashes and they display speculative bubbles with market prices far removed from their equilibrium values. Economic research has hitherto been able to make only limited progress in resolving these important practical and policy relevant issues of the apparent instability in financial markets. This proposal seeks to develop elements of a new paradigm which (i) explicitly takes into account the existence of various forms of heterogeneous, boundedly rational behaviour in financial markets as well as in goods and labour markets, (ii) investigates the potential of such behaviour to generate bubbles, crashes and a system-wide break down of activity as collective outcomes of individual activities, (iii) investigates the linkages and repercussions between the complex area of financial activity and real economic activity which could be affected by e.g., the cancellation of credit lines and a breakdown of expected liquidity provision, (iv) studies how the transmission channel of monetary policy works in times of distress in the financial markets (particularly the interbank market) and how it could restore the credit flow from banks to companies operating in the real sector. We will adopt a methodologically pluralistic approach trying to augment existing macro models and construct new (agent-based) ones from bottom-up. The results will provide insights into the consequences of different modelling paradigms for the conduct of monetary policy, and in particular, appropriate reactions of monetary authorities to prevalent financial distress.",1,0

INCOBRA is expected to contribute to (i) Increased cooperation patterns – by supporting cooperation networks among BR and EU R&I actors (Work Package –WP2), (ii) Enhanced framework conditions – by fostering coordination and alignment of R&I funding in BR and EU (WP3), (iii) More focused BR-EU R&I cooperation – by identifying emerging topics and opportunities in priority R&I areas for cooperation (WP1). Capacity building, sustainability will also be fully addressed by INCOBRA (WP4 and WP5, respectively). INCOBRA’s approach is completely aligned with the EU Strategy for International R&I Cooperation, the EU Roadmap for R&I Cooperation with BR, the BR-EU Policy Dialogue priorities and with the work of the Strategic Forum for International STI Cooperation (SFIC). It thus draws upon a multilateral perspective (interests and needs of BR-state level, BR-federal level, EU and EU-Member States), whilst capitalizing and going beyond the outcomes of the previous R&I cooperation project with Brazil (B.BICE\). INCOBRA’s approach also assumes innovation (holistic concept) as a key driver for BR-EU STI cooperation and Strategic Foresight as a relevant tool to anticipate R&I trends of mutual interest for BR and EU R&I actors, while promoting mutual openness of BR and EU R&I funding programmes to encourage cooperation. The INCOBRA consortium comprises 13 partners (7 from EU and 6 from BR), including Universities, Research Organizations, International Organizations, Technology Parks, Private Companies and Funding Agencies. Building upon a stakeholder-driven basis, INCOBRA already incorporates 36 organizations as members of the Stakeholder Group to be deployed during the project.",0,0
326,80925,No,"Wider Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East: strategic interests vs. identity dynamics in EU foreign policy making","The proposed research focuses on the EU's policy towards the Mediterranean/Middle East in view of the recently launched 'Wider Europe' scheme. Proposed by the EU Commission in March 2003, 'Wider Europe' reflects the dynamics of EU enlargement, prompting the EU to delineate its external borders and to reconsider relations to those neighbours that will not enter the EU in the foreseeable future. As a 'consolation prize', 'Wider Europe' proposes significantly upgraded relations with the economically and politically most 'advanced' neighbours, including the full integration into the EU's single market. This proposition is particularly relevant for the EU's policy towards the Mediterranean and Middle East. In fact, if implemented, Israel is expected to gain most from the 'Wider Europe' framework, as recent discussions between EU representatives and Israeli officials suggest.  Thus, 'Wider Europe' implies a departure from both the regionally oriented Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the EU's traditional stance on Middle Ea stpeace-making. In spite of the Commission's explicit intention of integrating the 'Wider Europe' scheme into the EU's Mediterranean policy, a thorough analysis of motivations and implications points to a number of incompatibilities. This research assumes that the latter result from two very different logics within EU foreign policy-making, one reflecting the formulation of strategic foreign policy interests, the other resulting from the EU's 'internal' identity dynamics in view of EU enlargement. In light of t his assumption, there search objectives are three-fold: First, based on a concrete case study, the research aims at shedding light on EU foreign policy in-the-making. In this vein, it will investigate the different lines of policy in terms of origin, underlying logic, justification, and their interplay. Second, it will assess the impact of 'Wider Europe' on the EU's policy towards the Mediterranean/Middle East.",0,0
924,197895,No,Pathways Regulating Intramyocellular Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolism in Health and Disease,"Currently, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis underpinning insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), due to their dramatically increasing prevalence. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent modulators of skeletal (Sk) muscle insulin sensitivity, as exemplified in patients with GC excess, Cushing’s syndrome, who develop IR and T2DM. Importantly, increased GC generation locally in muscle may contribute to the phenotype in T2DM patients. Although the precise molecular mechanisms driving IR in both T2DM and Cushing’s syndrome are unclear, dysregulated lipid metabolism is a common feature of insulin resistant muscle. This proposal aims to identify how GCs regulate intramyocellular lipid metabolism, and how this impacts on muscle insulin sensitivity. In addition, we will test a novel therapeutic target involved in mediating the metabolic actions of GCs, recently described by Dr Carolyn Cummins, the supervisor of the outgoing phase of this proposal. The complementary expertise in integrative molecular physiology of Dr Cummins, and of the Experienced Researcher, Dr Stuart Morgan, dovetail nicely within an established multi-disciplinary collaborative network of pharmacologists, molecular biologists and analytical chemists at the University of Toronto that have a unifying goal to uncover novel mechanisms regulating IR. Specifically, this proposal employs a systems approach by integrating both in vivo and in vitro pharmacological and genetic manipulation, with lipidomic/proteomic profiling and in-depth molecular characterisations. This novel strategy will significantly advance our understanding of key processes regulating insulin sensitivity in Sk muscle, a process essential for normal glucose homeostasis.",0,0
370,101911,No,New Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Liquid Crystals Based on Nano Building Units,"We propose to develop and investigate new hybrid organic-inorganic liquid crystals, based on nanobuilding blocks. We want to combine the self-organising properties of liquid crystals and the - both from a fundamental and technological point of view - interesting properties of metal-oxygen compounds. By using chemical synthesis routes well known to the host laboratory, we will synthesise the compounds and investigate their properties.     This project does not intend to simply adding special properties to existing compounds, but to developing a whole new architecture for liquid crystals. The host laboratory is a leading institute in the field of chemistry of hybrid materials, with collaborations on national and international level and therefore provides an excellent scientific environment to perform this project. In addition, it has gained a broad experience in the training and supervision of students and post-doctoral fellows during the past years, e.g., by taking part in a Marie Curie Research and Training Network.     The applicant is an ideal candidate for this project, as he has built up experience on the synthesis of nanoparticles and investigation of the liquid crystalline properties of these. This project enables this promising researcher to pursue his career in the field of physical chemistry by improving his existing experience and knowledge and broadening his horizon by entering a new field. It gives the applicant ample opportunities to train the skills necessary to reaching his goal of an independent academic group leader with a strong vision of international collaborations.     The objective of the proposal is very relevant to the EU, as it addresses several of the priorities (e.g., interdisciplinary research into understanding phenomena, mastering processes and developing research tools, nanometre scale engineering techniques, and development of fundamental knowledge) of the research Activity Area 'Nanotechnologies and nano-sciences' of FP6 of the EU.",0,0

Specific aims are at a) helping the User Organisations involved in overcoming all the barriers to adoption commonly shared at a European level; b) creating a strictly inter-related consortium able to provide guidance and monitoring in the innovation process; c) create a real success stories portfolio to validate the advantages of the technologies proposed and spread the experience gained.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK INES is composed by a consortium of 4 support centres, called TEC (Technology Expertise Centres) from four European countries and 13 user organisations (User companies). The project work will consist in the realisation of 13 User Experiments (UEs - each one included in this proposal as a self-contained work package) and in the implementation of a strong dissemination activity able to provide an effective demonstration of the impact of the innovative technology introduction. The UEs are all real business cases in which new methodologies and techniques for the users are introduced through Embedded Internet Networking microelectronic technologies. Before this proposal submission, TECs have already carried out a proactive action to inform potential industrial users on the selected technology, realised specific Feasibility Studies and Business analysis of the economic impact. During the work on progress, the integrated and cross-border structure of TECs will provide an efficient support and reference to the involved companies, as well as guidance, monitoring, training and results exploitation to ensure an effective and successful Know-how transfer. At the end of each project, the 'Best Practice' experience gained will be extracted to realise a reference material to be re-used in further internal and external exploitation of the results.

Within this context, important efforts have been carried out within FP to support collaboration amongst the different stakeholders involved in R&amp;D at European level.The SSAI Constituency (Software Services - Engineering, Architectures, Infrastructures) has been particularly active, implementing what has been called 'concertation mechanisms'. However, the way these initiatives are being implemented is being surpassed by the increasing importance of collaboration towards the future and of the complexity of technical issues related to future services. It becomes a pressing need to revise collaboration mechanisms within the SSAI Constituency overcoming critical limitations of existing ones. Furthermore, with the current financial model sustainability of these instruments is not guaranteed, nor in terms of continuation of efforts towards excellence of collaboration.HOLA! aims at supporting the EC in the creation of a critical mass of SSAI stakeholders working together in building concepts for services in the Future Internet.

The aim is to perform total volume inspection far more rapidly, accurately and cheaply than is presently achieved with magnetic and ultrasonic pigs by developing a circumferential collar of LRUG sensors and novel time reversal focussing to produce a map of the circumferential and axial pipe corrosion and cracks. As LRUG sensors detect all significant corrosion in oil and gas pipelines within typically 50 metre of the sensors in a few milliseconds, long lengths of pipe can be scanned very rapidly with sample wave echo patterns obtained only every 50 metres thereby data storage requirements will be orders of magnitude less than present inspection methods. The speed of travel through the pipe could thus be faster than pigs that gather data with ultrasonic compression probes.  To test the technology developed by the project, the LRUG collar will be deployed initially by a mechanism to pull the collar through a pipe full of water at different constant and also varying speeds.  A prototype robot will be developed that is intrinsically safe for operation in explosive environments and that is lightweight (neutrally buoyant) to investigate how best to deploy the LRUG technology in a real pipeline with faster travel and cheaper robots.",0,0

384,220418,No,Statistical Methods For High Dimensional Diffusions,"In the past twenty years the availability of vast dimensional data, typically referred to as big data, has given rise to exciting challenges in various fields of mathematics and computer sciences. The increasing need for getting a better understanding of such data in internet traffic, biology, genetics, and economics, has lead to a revolution in statistical and machine learning, optimisation and numerical analysis. Due to high dimensionality of modern statistical models, parameter estimation is a difficult task and statisticians typically investigate estimation methods under sparsity constraints. While an abundance of estimation algorithms is now available for high dimensional discrete models, a rigorous mathematical investigation of estimation problems for high dimensional continuous-time processes is completely undeveloped.  The aim of STAMFORD is to provide a concise statistical theory for estimation of high dimensional diffusions. Such high dimensional processes naturally appear in modelling particle interactions in physics, neural networks in biology or large portfolios in economics, just to name a few. The methodological part of the project will require development of novel  advanced techniques in mathematical statistics and probability theory. In particular, new results will be needed in parametric and non-parametric statistics, and high dimensional probability, that are reaching far beyond the state-of-the-art.

46,111221,Yes,Welfare State Futures,"Welfare states are at a critical turning point. The development of welfare systems was one of the defining characteristics of the 20th century, especially in Europe. However, in times of change, it is important to re-think ‘the welfare state’ with a programme of innovative research designed to ask, and answer, fundamental questions about the design, delivery and experience of welfare in the 21st century. It is for this reason that the NORFACE network is launching an international research programme on the topic of Welfare State Futures. This highly topical theme offers an approach from a variety of perspectives and disciplines, enables and encourages multi-disciplinarity and offers a fruitful topic for a European approach, with interesting opportunities for comparison.  Since 2004 the NORFACE Network has proved itself as a successful coordinated common action of – currently - sixteen national research funding agencies. NORFACE (New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Cooperation in Europe) has offered unique opportunities for participating funding agencies by developing common research funding instruments, thus creating opportunities for facilitating and building new networks of research collaboration. Major achievements up until now have been three transnational initiatives: three rounds of the NORFACE Seminar Series in 2005, 2006 and 2007, the pilot research programme “Re-emergence of Religion as a Social Force in Europe?” (€ M 5,4) in 2006 and the transnational research programme “Migration in Europe - Social, Economic, Cultural and policy Dynamics” (€ M 23 and M € 6 ERA-Net Plus contribution) in 2008.

This over-reliance on a single organism to produce the worlds drugs is a major problem for the development of compounds with alternative modes of action which can overcome and delay the onset of drug resistance. To address this problem we will form an international multi-disciplinary group of experts to bioprospect for biologically active natural products. The central aim of this programme is to start rapidly deriving novel drugs from non-actinomycete sources.  We will isolate novel strains of the proven but not well-explored drug producers Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus. These bacteria will be isolated from insect pathogenic nematodes and characterized taxonomically (WP1) and strains will be analyzed for the production of novel compounds (WP2). This library of compounds will then be tested against a broad set of targets including bacteria, fungi, protozoans, nematodes, insects, and mammalian cell cultures (WP3). The five most productive bacterial strains will then be fully sequenced and used to construct genomic libraries. These libraries will be used to generate recombinant clones in heterologous hosts, enabling fast and efficient biotechnological production of the bioactive compounds (WP4). To ensure efficient interactions and comparability of results, especially regarding the bioactivity data, training sessions will be organized with seminars and hands on experience for each of the groups at a central site (WP5). Robust patent stuctures will ensure efficient technology transfer to our industrial partners (WP6) and overall coordination of the scientific and training programs will be overseen by WP7.",0,0
938,82096,No,Use of embryonic stem cells and organotypic spinal cord slice preparations to establish cell-based therapies for spinal cord injury,"The disruption of spinal cord motor and sensory pathways following traumatic injury has devastating consequences for damaged patients. Regenerative strategies include the use of cell-based therapies to bridge the lesion. The main objective of this project is to investigate and optimise therapeutic strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI) by combining cell-based therapies with concurrent or sequential application of neuro-protective and/or regenerative pro-factors. We intend to obtain neural-derived embryonic s tem cells to be used for transplantation as prime experiments reported shed hopeful results. However, several questions remain unsolved critical to plan optimised therapies. One of these issues is the mechanism involved regenerative event after cell grafting. By using genetically engineered embryonic stem (ES) cells, we should be able to determine whether regeneration is specifically promoted by cell integration itself into the repaired tissue or by the factors released by them.  An optimal therapeutic strategy for SCI using ES cells will be selected using an in vitro model for neurotrauma based on organotypic spinal cord slice preparations. The establishment of this model is another objective of the project and should facilitate the efficient screening of a broad spectrum of factors in combination with cell graft. It may reduce notably the number of animals destined for this purpose. The most advantageous strategy, derived from this screening will be analysed in vivo on murine models for SCI and functional recovery will be evaluated by a complete battery of electrophysiological and behaviour tests. In summary, the accomplishment of those objectives should shed light into essential neural regenerative processes, may provide innovative systems for high-throughput screenings and should determine optimal therapeutic strategies to repair injured spinal cords.",0,0

In such a framework I intend to address the following issues: - Qualitative analysis of the model with multiple markets for each commodity, which are imperfectly competitive: structure and properties of equilibrium outcomes.  - Imperfect competition as the source of price disparities across markets for the same commodity.  - Application to international trade with imperfectly competitive markets: In international trade, systems of markets are segregated not merely by region but most importantly but by the fact that different currencies are accepted as means of exchange. I plan to focus on the effects of a common currency on relative prices, balance of trade and welfare across international systems of imperfectly competitive markets.  Training contact (objective, benefit ant expected impact)  The objective of this project is the rigorous study of imperfect competition across systems of markets. The benefit from this project is expected to be twofold: On the policy level the conclusions of this research are expected to be useful to policy-makers, as this project is directed to issues of monetary unification. On the scientific level I expect to produce articles for presentation in international conferences and for publication to scientific journals.  The topic is a yet unexplored area of imperfect competition. I expect researchers from other fields of economics to benefit from this research since the intended study has many diverse applications in economics (e.g. regional economics).",0,0
86,87287,No,Meta-rules and constitutional law: 'co-regulating' legislative processes in Europe?,"Given the fundamental importance of legislation to society, legal scholarship has generated remarkably few insights into the norms that effectively govern legislative processes. Between the extra-legal constraints traditionally studied by political science and the formal constitutional framework that is the territory of constitutional law scholarship, a grey area of seemingly bureaucratic rules on lawmaking can be identified. This project refers to these rules as ‘meta-rules’ and aims to analyse the way they interact with constitutional law.  The recent proliferation of ‘Better Regulation’ policies in Europe has led to a convergence of meta-rules applied in different legislative arenas and to a growing salience of these norms. Many meta-rules overlap with constitutional norms in terms of subject matter, for instance the issue of who gets access to the legislative process. However, these rules are inspired by the paradigm of the regulatory state rather than by the traditional rationale of democratic lawmaking. An example of a meta-rule is ‘a legislative proposal can only be put forward if it is accompanied by an impact assessment’. Such a requirement follows a different logic than the assumption that ‘the sovereign parliament can initiate laws as it sees fit’ which is often part of traditional constitutional frameworks. Are meta-rules as they emerge from increased transnational cooperation in the framework of EU ‘Better Regulation’ capable of overriding the formal constitutional rules and principles in certain cases? Or do they instead facilitate their implementation in the day-to-day practice of lawmaking? It is proposed to combine macro-level research on meta-rules by expanding existing databases on regulatory policies in Europe with more detailed case-study based analysis. In doing so traditional methods such as elite interviewing and textual interpretation will be combined with methods that are new to legal research, such as quantitative textual analysis.",0,0
495,42255,No,Vertical restraints and competition policy - the case of multibrand retailers,"Many relationships between manufacturers of goods and their distributors (e.g. wholesalers and retailers) are governed by distribution contracts that stipulate certain obligations for one or both parties, thereby limiting in some way their commercial freedom. These obligations are commonly referred to as 'vertical restraints'.  The economic literature has considerably improved our understanding of the impact of vertical restraints on competitions between brands and among distributors. A drawback of the current literature is, however, that research on the subject has almost entirely been carried out in the context of competing single-product retailers and in the context of retail monopolies. Very little research has been done yet in the context of competition between retailers each carrying a similar assortment of products and brands (between 'multibrand retailers' ), although it is a context that actually applies to many goods markets.  The central objective of the research project is to obtain a closer understanding of the impact of exclusive dealing arrangements and of resale price maintenance provisions in the context of multibrand retailers, using a spatial competition model. On the basis of this analysis (and the subsequent analysis of case law) suggestions for European competition policy will be formulated.  Considering the outstanding reputation of many of the institute's scientists in the domain of contract theory and vertical restraints (a.o. Rey, Tirole, Martimort and Cremer) and the fact that I will be under the direct supervision of Professor Rey, it is hard to think of a better place to do this research project and to develop the skills necessary for future research.",0,0
405,97061,No,Energy-Hub for residential and commercial districts and transport,"The ambition of this project is to enable the utilisation of the full potential of renewable energy (up to covering 100% of the energy demand on district level). In order to reach this goal, the E-hub concept is developed, which is crucial for the implementation of such a large share of renewables. An E-Hub is a physical cross point, similar to an energy station, in which energy and information streams are interconnected, and where the different forms of energy can be converted into each other and/or can be stored. The E-hub exchanges energy via the energy grids between the different actors (e.g. households, renewable energy plants, offices), who may be a consumer at one time, and a supplier at another time. The consumers and suppliers exchange information on their energy needs and energy production with the energy hub, the hub then distributes the energy available in the most efficient way. For proper matching of supply and demand, the E-hub uses conversion and storage of energy, as well as load shifting. The consumers and suppliers should be connected to this E-hub by means of bi-directional energy grids (low and/or high temperature heat grid, cold grid for cooling, electrical grid (AC and/or DC), gas grid (H2, biogas, syngas). The renewable energy may be generated locally (e.g. from PV on residences) or by centralised means (a geothermal plant or a large CHP located within the district that may be fuelled by biofuel or H2). The E-Hub concept holds for all types of energy flow, from heating and cooling to electricity, biogas and H2, and may connect not only households but also (electrical) cars, commercial buildings or industry. The aim of the proposed project is: to develop the e-hub as a system, to develop technologies that are necessary to realize the system, to develop business models in order to overcome institutional and financial barriers, and to demonstrate an E-hub in the form of a real situation and in a few case studies/feasibility studies.",0,0

SoCaTel will create, implement and pilot a multi-module/multi-stakeholder platform, which fosters ageing-in- place in a friendly environment and community. This platform, based on past project results such as OASIS and its open government platform Ozwillo, will facilitate end-users’ free choice of government and non-government long-term care services according to their needs, and will empower citizens’ voices and their representatives to champion their causes. Users, public services and innovators will collaborate throughout the process, from design through to development and testing, and onto implementation – facilitating the co-creation of novel services to address emerging needs and opportunities, while encouraging bottom-up innovation. SoCaTel will use governmental and private data sources, via links to platforms such as UniversAAL and PERLIS elderly supervision system, thus also creating additional business opportunities. The SoCaTel approach and platform will be piloted in 4 countries, involving service users, government authorities, universities and the private sector: Spain, Finland, Hungary and Ireland, thus covering different welfare state models and addressing different challenges and cultural settings.  SoCaTel puts forward solid frameworks for co-creation, impact assessment, ethics and change management, promoting a smooth introduction of co-creation approaches into public administration. The outputs of the project will be a range of services co-created during the pilots and ready to be deployed. The SoCaTel technological platform will be released as open source, facilitating its uptake by public authorities across Europe, as well as creating business opportunities to the SoCaTel SMEs and to third parties.",0,0
113,211257,No,"Multi-Functional Detective System (MFDS) – Advanced, ‘Intelligent Transport System’ creating smarter and safer European roads","Wilhelm Schröder GmbH has developed the ‘Multi-Functional Detection System’ (MFDS), a highly versatile ‘Intelligent Transport System’ that will make EU roads better integrated, safer, intelligent and environmentally friendly. MFDS is a unique, affordable and unrestricted telematics technology with several functions: wrong-way driver detection, traffic congestion detection, vehicle counting by vehicle classification and parking accounting. The core innovation of the MFDS is its capability to complete all functions simultaneously in a single system that is low-cost to procure and install with low-power usage.  An MFDS unit consists of a detection of 6 delineators (pillars) that distributes a secure radio field across the target path; objects within the field are passively detected and classified with 100% precision. Data obtained is immediately communicated to motorists via an LED lighting interface built into the delineators as well as being securely provided via cloud to the relevant officials via system interfaces to warn motorists in a wider perimeter with other means.  With our initial target market in the EU, during Phase 1 and Phase 2 we plan to market to road operators in target countries with the intention to generate pre-sales that will enable our target volume sales once Phase 3 is reached in 2020. Once commercialised, we plan for 6,500\ unit sets to be deployed by 2024.  The principle project objective is to enhance MFDS and demonstrate to the target market the efficiency and environmental improvements our technology offers over state-of-the-art alternatives. This Feasibility Study will allow us to complete a market study and use customer feedback to develop the project concept; identify strategic Phase 2 collaborators; scope the legislative pathway; plan the technical and commercial work to be completed during Phase 2 and produce a fully elaborated business plan to be used as the basis of a Phase 2 application.",0,0
224,87845,No,Detailed Modelling of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Binary Stars,"The study of binary stars is critical to all branches of astronomy. Binary stars allow a precise determination of stellar masses and provide the unique evolutionary path leading to type Ia supernovae, novae, X-ray bursts and possibly even gamma-ray bursts. However, systematic models of the various physical processes involved during the evolution of interacting low- and intermediate-mass wide binaries are lacking and suffer theoretical uncertainties associated with mass transfer, chemical mixing and orbital evolution. This becomes obvious upon examination of state of the art models of chemically peculiar low-mass stars such as the barium stars: the eccentricities and periods of the models are completely at odds with the observations. This project focuses exclusively on low- and intermediate-mass stars in wide orbits for which few investigations have been made.  I plan to address some of the above issues by converting the STAREVOL single-star evolution code of the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IAA-ULB, Brussels) into a binary-star code by incorporating the latest physical prescriptions for orbital evolution, mass transfer and chemical mixing due to tides and thermohaline mixing. The evolution of the two stars will be followed simultaneously and updates will be made to the nuclear network to follow quantitatively the slow neutron capture process in binary systems. My models will then be confronted with observed s-rich stars such as the barium and CH stars.  This self-consistent approach will provide a better understanding of the physical processes affecting the orbital and chemical properties of low- and intermediate-mass wide binary stars. The developments made for this project will open new areas of research to me, including possible future investigations of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae or gamma-ray bursts, studies of nuclear astrophysics and the connection between pulsation and mass transfer.",0,0
124,198528,No,COST at a turning point: A unique framework for pan-European ST cooperation as clear demonstration of European values,"COST is an intergovernmental framework for cooperation in science and technology (S&T). Founded in 1971, it supports collaborative S&T networks called COST Actions – a unique cooperation instrument allowing the joint development of ideas across all scientific disciplines through trans-European networking of nationally funded research activities.  A process of significant review and adaptation of COST strategies and policies has been recently giving birth to a new COST, focused on inclusiveness, societal impact, output orientation and lean implementation. A fully dedicated legal entity under the direct responsibility and guidance of the COST Member Countries, the COST Association, has been established.  The main objective of the present proposal is to allow COST to continue to meet the complex challenges that characterise Europe’s research and innovation agenda and in particular to pursue four solid and societally relevant objectives:  1. Join research efforts and develop common S&T programs by supporting high quality pan-European S&T networks 2. Build research capacity and strengthen S&T excellence across the ERA 3. Address societal questions by promoting trans-disciplinary research 4. Widen participation and inclusiveness through tailored mechanisms, fostering integration across the ERA   COST represents European added value as it is the sole pan-European framework fostering open and bottom-up S&T cooperation networks, driven by researchers’ needs. Its focus on excellence, openness and inclusiveness has proved a successful formula over many years.  Institutional, operational and administrative levels of intervention allow COST to effectively pursue the objectives above and to fulfil its mission. The consistent and continuously improved implementation of COST, already proved successful during the first year of the COST Framework implementation under Horizon 2020, will enable it to strongly contribute to Horizon 2020 objectives.",0,0
999,48073,No,Feather pecking: solutions through understanding,"Egg production represents an important sector of the farming industry. Approximately 250 million laying hens are kept in the EU. Because of public concern over poultry welfare, the demand for non-cage eggs and, consequently, the development of alternative housing systems have increased, particularly in Northern Europe.   However, the introduction of alternative housing systems produce an increased risk of feather pecking (FP). FP is widely considered to be one of the major welfare problems facing laying hens, particularly if they are housed in alternative systems rather than battery cages. FP has many deleterious effects. FP consists of pecking and pulling at the feathers of other birds and thereby it can cause damage to the plumage and loss of feathers. This can impose a financial burden because birds with few feathers lose heat faster, have greater energetic needs and thereby cost more to feed. Not only may birds be h1jured when they are severely pecked (which in itself is painful) but the associated feather loss increases susceptibility to further injury, particularly if panic reactions lead to trampling and clawing. Finally, FP may lead to cannibalism, birds may be literally pecked to death if this catastrophic phenomenon develops.   Remedial measures currently practised by the poultry industry have associated welfare problems. For example, beak trimming, which involves partial amputation of the beak, is a widely practised and effective control measure. However, it causes pain both during and after the operation. FP is also reduced by keeping birds under dim light but this practice impoverishes the visual environment and it can cause eye abnormalities, such as dimlight buphthalmos.   There is a strong pressure in the EU to ban battery cages and develop viable alternative housillg systems. However, the increased risk of FP is a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of alten1ative housing, such as free range, aviaries, percheries etc.. Therefore, it is imperative that we improve our understanding of this behavioural problem and thereby maximise our attempts to solve it.   Our project addresses EU research priorities related to animal welfare which were identified in the Framework Programme. It is also directly relevant to recent communications from the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee, Animal Welfare Section, where it was concluded that 'other problems, especially the major problem of FP, need further research' (EU-SVC, 1996).   The main objective of this project is to improve the welfare of laying hens by increasing our understandh1g of the internal (originating within the bird) and external (originating from its environment) variables underpinning the development and reduction of FP.   Emphasis will be placed on identifying:  i) individual behavioural and physiological characteristics associated with high FP,  ii) inanimate stimuli (and their component features that elicit sustained pecking),  iii) attractive properties of pecked birds, and detemining if FP spreads within a flock, and finally,  iv) evaluating methods that could be used to minimise FP in industry and formulating recommendations.   By integrating the efforts of three European research groups and two European industrial partners, this timely project offers a unique, multi-disciplinary and complementary blend of resources and expertise. Our ultimate goal is to develop innovative strategies (e.g. devices to divert pecking away from flockmates, potential genetic selection criteria) which can replace beak trimming as a way of preventing FP (and the potential development of cannibalism) and to thereby enhance poultry welfare. Direct industry participation from different countries guarantees effective application of the results. This will improve public perception of the European poultry industry and hlcrease its competitiveness.",0,0
288,217977,No,Cross-lingual Event-centric Open Analytics Research Academy,"With a rapidly increasing degree of integration among the European countries, a rising number of events, such as Paris shootings and Brexit, strongly impact the European community and the European digital economy across language and country borders. This development results in a vast amount of event-centric multilingual information available from different communities in the news, on the Web and in social media. Cross-lingual technologies to efficiently access, analyse and interact with this information are of utmost importance for various stakeholder groups across Europe, including digital humanities, memory institutions, publishers, media monitoring companies and journalists.  The Cleopatra ITN offers a unique interdisciplinary and intersectoral research and training programme addressing these challenges. The main objectives are to: 1) Facilitate advanced cross-lingual processing of event-centric textual and visual information on a large scale; 2) develop innovative methods for efficient and intuitive user access and interaction with multilingual information; 3) facilitate large-scale analytics of multilingual event-centric information and cross-cultural studies; 4) educate a group of top-level scientists with unique interdisciplinary and intersectoral expertise in multilingual information science who will be enabled to take leading roles in research and industry in the future; and 5) establish an interdisciplinary curriculum for cross-lingual information analytics.  The main outcomes of Cleopatra include: 1) novel methods for event-centric cross-lingual processing; 2) highly innovative user interaction paradigms for multilingual information; 3) open large-scale data sets and software components for a variety of EU languages; and 4) an interdisciplinary curriculum and educational materials. Overall, Cleopatra will contribute to the European digital economy in several application domains and strengthen the European position in multilingual information science.",0,0
100,222975,No,Differential demographic behaviour by education and its links with the reproduction of educational inequalities in Europe,"In the last decades, social inequalities within countries and the rise in socio-economic differences between European countries have been an increasing policy concern. Education plays a chief role as a resource to fight poverty and to ensure greater social and territorial cohesion, within and across countries, as recognised by the Europe 2020 strategy. Supporting individuals to achieve tertiary education is a necessary policy-target, however, in the long-term, it may not be sufficient to eradicate educational differences across countries. This is especially due to the links between differential demographic behaviours by educational groups and the intergenerational transmission of education.  Keeping a comparative approach by country and sex, this project aims at highlighting macro-level consequences of the educational gradient in family formation processes and the transmission of tertiary education from one generation to the next one. To this end, I will use the most recent comparable cross-country individual survey-data (SHARE, GGS), and I will apply advanced statistical techniques (i.e., decomposition and simulation methods) that permit to reconcile micro-macro levels of analysis. This project emphasizes the fact that enacting family policies, which aim to flatten the educational gradient in demographic behaviour, is a possible way to reduce educational differences across European countries. Next, I also emphasize the bidirectional relationship between parent-children generations. On the one hand, I focus on the transmission of education from parents to children and, on the other hand, I refer to (potential) feedback effects of children’s education on parents’ survival. Overall, this project will uncover the connections between the fields of demography and social inequalities. Low fertility and higher life expectancy at older ages, which are the drivers of population ageing, are not necessarily bad outcomes when they may lead to a decrease in social inequalities.",1,0
630,106756,No,Making Persons with Disabilities Full Citizens - New Knowledge for an Inclusive and Sustainable European Social Model,"DISCIT aims to produce new knowledge enabling Member States, affiliated European countries and the European Union to achieve full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in society and the economy. In investigating the social and political conditions for making such participation a reality, the project adopts a multifaceted understanding of Active Citizenship. Adopting a multilevel and institutional perspective, DISCIT examines how different types of policies (social benefits, social services and social regulation instruments) can be mutually supportive in enhancing Active Citizenship for persons with disabilities.  Using the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as a framework of reference, DISCIT identifies more effective ways to remove and prevent physical, attitudinal, social and organisational barriers to Active Citizenship and participation on an equal basis with others, in a context of rapid social and economic change and evolving conceptions of disability across European societies. DISCIT synthesises policy lessons from a strategic sample of European states: ‘Liberal’ (Ireland, United Kingdom), ‘Conservative’ (Germany, Italy), ‘Social Democratic’ (Norway, Sweden) and ‘Post-Communist’ (Czech Republic, Serbia) regimes. DISCIT involves consortium members from all these countries in addition to Switzerland and Belgium. DISCIT’s results provide new insight into how the European Union can support Member States and affiliated European countries in working towards the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities as expressed in the Fundamental Rights under the EC Treaty and the CRPD. By clarifying the possibilities for a strengthened synergy between policies at diverse levels of governance, DISCIT contributes to knowledge for realizing the ambitions of the EU Disability Strategy 2010-2020 and the Europe 2020 Strategy for Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth.  DISCIT has a duration of 36 months; is coordinated by Norwegian Social Research (NOVA); the consortium members are universities, research institutes and two civil society organisations (EDF and MDRI-S). The consortium is supported by a Scientific Advisory Committee with distinguished members mainly from countries not covered by the consortium members, a European Stakeholder Committee and eight National Stakeholder Committees. www.discit.eu",0,0

The International Cold Forging Congresses (ICFC) as the premier gathering in this technology field are held once every five years under the auspices of the International Cold Forging Group (ICFG) with venues alternating between Germany and the UK.  The 10th ICFC provides a key forum for dissemination of leading edge technologies and includes a presentation of state-of-the-art equipment for the manufacture of precision cold forged parts, together with demonstrations of current manufacturing processes and operations. It aims to stimulate contact between specialists active in academic research and industrial development in all areas of cold forging technologies and to promote scientific exchange within the European Community and between Europe and other parts of the world. In support of an enhanced industrial involvement it promotes topics of high industrial relevance. Therefore the ICFC is an excellent opportunity especially for young researchers such as graduate, doctoral and post-doctoral students to present their scientific work to an international audience, to learn about state-of-the-art topics and to engage into discussions with high reputed researchers from academic and industry. Female researchers were especially encouraged to participate by the organisers. The conference gives existing European R&D consortia and networks the opportunity to present their achievements and promotes the creation of new European networks of cold forging scientist.

662,83334,No,Stationary solutions for non-linear random dynamical systems,"The project will primarily address invariant measures of random dynamical systems arising as random perturbations of deterministic infinite-dimensional non-linear systems. Those systems include non-linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations in bounded, unbounded and periodic domains, systems with memory and related. Our basic tool will be probabilistic representations of solutions for those systems also known as Feynman-Kac type formulae.  Our primary goals in studying those systems are: 1) to prove existence and uniqueness results for stationary solutions. 2) to prove existence of determining functionals. 3) to study the corresponding random attractors. 4) to develop probabilistic representation of solutions for a wider class of systems  Probabilistic representations of solutions of partial differential equations have proved to be an important and powerful tool in analysis of partial differential equations both in the coordinate space and Fourier space, and a recent observation is that Feynman-Kac type formulae are particularly suited for analysis of random attractors. For instance, analysis of the original Feynman-Kac formula was successfully applied to the problem of existence/uniqueness of stationary solutions for the stochastic Burgers equations by Sinai (1992) and E. Khanin, Mazel & Sinai (2002). To give another example, a beautiful stochastic cascade representation for solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes system in the Fourier space which involves branching random walks due to Le Jan and Sznitman (1997) was used by Bakhtin (2004) to construct a stationary solution for the Navier-Stokes system in 3D with random force and prove its uniqueness. This approach promises to be fruitful in pursuing the goals listed above for other systems admitting probabilistic representations such as semilinear parabolic equation studied by Dynkin with collaborators (1990s - 2000s) using superdiffusions.",0,0
433,198477,No,The Making of the Earth – Reading the Geochemical Code from Meteorites and the Earth’s Oldest Rocks,"It is still an open question how Earth became the rocky habitable planet as we know it today. This is because there is a significant time gap of several 100 million years between Earth’s oldest rock archives (ca. 4 billion years old) and most extraterrestrial samples like meteorites that archive the birth of our solar system ca. 4.5 billion years ago. Within this time gap, three key processes that shaped our planet took place, i.e., Earth’s growth via asteroidal collisions, formation of the metal core and a first solid crust, and the delivery of volatiles such as water. Because rock samples are lacking, these fundamental processes have to be traced indirectly, by using highly sophisticated geochemical tools like isotope or trace element compositions of younger rocks or meteorites.   With this proposal, I plan to better unravel Earth’s earliest history and better identify its building blocks, by combining the geochemical record locked in Earth`s oldest rocks and extraterrestrial samples. The ground breaking nature of this work is the development of new geochemical techniques that are way beyond the current state of art, and many of them will be applied at an unprecedented level of sensitivity and precision. I will cover three linked approaches, namely high precision analyses of (i) nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies, (ii) radiogenic isotopes and (iii) trace elements. To better constrain the history of volatile delivery to the nascent Earth, a focus will be on comparing the geochemical record provided by refractory and volatile elements. In their synergy, the results will provide a major advance in unravelling Earth’s earliest history.  INFANTEARTH builds on high profile research strengths of our group, where a unique pool of collaborating scientists and analytical equipment are available. We have also acquired a nearly unique collection of Earth’s oldest rock samples and of extraterrestrial samples supplied from institutions such as NASA or collaborating museums.",0,0
129,111035,No,Frictions in the Financial System,"'The financial crisis, since its start in 2008 has exposed enormous fractures both in the financial architecture and in the structure of the global economy. Although with some notable exceptions, the magnitude of the events caught the finance profession largely by surprise. Clearly, we have to understand better the institutional mechanism channeling savings towards the best uses of capital, and to what extent this mechanism can sometimes fail. The projects in this proposal will push the boundaries of our knowledge in this direction. I suggest a dual approach to achieve this goal. First, we have to improve our understanding of which frictions are the crucial impediments of the efficient functioning of markets. As this approach focuses on particular markets in isolation, I call this the micro approach. I propose three projects within this approach: trading and information diffusion in OTC markets, the crowdedness in limits-to-arbitrage, and the interaction of political uncertainty and sovereign bond prices. Second, from the frictions emerging from the micro approach, we have to select the ones which determine the aggregate liquidity fluctuations in the economy. I use this concept in a broad sense; referring to the changing efficiency with which the financial system allocates resources across investment opportunities. As this approach focuses on the functionality of the financial system as a whole, I call this the macro approach.  I propose two projects within this approach. The first project focuses on the determinants of the differences in the financial architecture of different economies. It builds a novel framework to study the dynamics of the financial sector of an economy. The second project studies the role of shadow banking in the fluctuation of aggregate liquidity. In particular, this project concentrates on the fluctuation of the efficiency of private liquidity creation as the state of the economy changes.'",0,0

SOCIETY aims to present research as the best tool to sort out the Societal Challenges that human beings face. SOCIETY will rely on interactivity and engagement at large: the project will aim to produce a Night co-design approach, in which researchers together with society will conceive the event programme.  After the success of the previous ERN edition, the Consortium comes with a new proposal, inspired by  the EU Year of Cultural Heritage. This is reflected by the new concept pointed out in the new title and acronym, where SOCIETY now stands for words that can be used to define our cultural heritage: Science, histOry, Culture, musIc, Environment, arT, technologY. The proposal stands at the intersection between these concepts. We’ll try to identify the features that shape and define our perception of ourselves and how we perceive who lives near and far from us. What is it that defines our culture? How and when is it that what we know, what we do, where we are, how we speak and move, and eat, and wear become culture? And finally, can our cultural heritage help us look ahead, understand the present, and to imagine the future? ERN events will explore the many ways in which research may help us understand, sustain, preserve, and develop our cultural heritage, in all its various shades and declinations.They will be designed in order to attract different kinds of publics. However, secondary school students, who are about to make their choice in terms of career, will be a privileged target, also through the involvement of Eu and MSCA researchers. Specific effort will be devoted to involve female young researchers and students in the activities, to stress that research needs increasing contribution from women to reach its goals.",0,0
671,65234,No,Migrants' transnational networks: their role in migrant incorporation and euro-mediterranean dialogue on development,"This research project takes its cue from the often repeated call for further comparative studies on migrant transnationalism and on how it impacts migrants process of settlement as well as their role in development of their country of origin (see Portes et al., 1999; 2001 ).The research will examine the scope, durability and consequences of the transnational social, economic and political/civic networks of Mahgreb migrants (primarily from Morocco ) in Barcelona - a city which has a particularly high and fast growing immigrant population from Mahgreb, as well as a strong voice in co-operation with both local migrant associations and their countries of origin. This will be done through a qualitative in-depth case study of migrants ' transnational networks including interviews with organizational leaders, migrants selected to represent the various socio-economic groups within the migrant community , and relevant institutional actors in Barcelona, Spain, and the country of origin. The transnational research agenda offers an innovative and holistic understanding of the economic, social and political universe of migrants which has proved fruitful in understanding their role and participation in other western European societies (see OEstergaard-Nielsen, 2001 ).The research findings will be located in a comparative perspective with my previous (D.Phil.) research on Turks in Germany. The two case studies have different migration trajectories and different political institutional contexts. This makes for academic and policy-relevant inferences relevant to our understanding of the scope and impact of migrant transnationalism in general and in a European context in particular. To gain comparative research experience in a southern European context will significantly broad land consolidate my expertise in studies of migration and migrant incorporation in Europe. It will provide the data and experience for my further conceptual and theoretical progress in work on migrant transnationalism.In this respect the Migration Research Unit at Universidat Autonoma de Barcelona will provide a very valuable interdisciplinary, high-level and accommodating research environment. My research agenda will, in particular, be complementary to their ongoing research on migrants ' associations and their civic participation. The Department will be an excellent platform from which to acquaint myself with the wider Spanish and Mediterranean research community on migration.

974,93197,No,Control of cell morphogenesis: Bacterial cell wall and actin-cytoskeleton,"A fundamental question in cell biology is how cells determine their shape. Each life form is surrounded by boundary layers that protect, communicate with the environment, and may confer shape and rigidity. However, little is known about the mechanisms determining cell shape, and the broader questions concerning morphogenesis are the same in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. How is cell shape regulated temporally and spatially? How is structural information acquired and maintained? In bacteria, the tough external peptidoglycan cell wall is known to be a primary determinant of cell shape. But despite decades of studies, both its ultra-structure and the molecular mechanisms that control wall morphogenesis are poorly understood. A radical change recently occurs with the discovery of a bacterial actin-like cytoskeleton as a primary determinant of cell wall biogenesis. Moreover, actin homologues (MreB family) are not only involved in cell morphogenesis but also in DNA segregation and cell polarity, suggesting a key function in cell development. However, the mechanistic details and the effectors used by MreB proteins to fulfil these roles remain to be elucidated. The general aims of this project are to elucidate the factors controlling bacterial cell wall morphogenesis and to determine the different functions of the bacterial cytoskeleton and the mechanisms underlying them. For this, an interdisciplinary approach combining the methods of genetic, microscopy, biochemistry, physico-chemistry and mathematical modelling will be used.",0,0
627,186817,No,Encodoing Social Interaction,"Living in a social environment requires extracting social information in a meaningful way, a process that involves the perception of socially relevant signals, representation in the brain and integration with prior experience, eventually leading to modulation of behavior. Understanding how the brain interprets the world requires us to integrate our understanding of genes, brain circuits and ongoing experiences that modify behavior. We are using Drosophila Melanogaster as a model organism to study the interplay between the social environment and the brain because of its accessibility to genetic and physiological manipulation as well as its complex behavioral repertoire. We have recently demonstrated that social experience in flies can modulate the way reward is perceived and in turn modulate reward-seeking behavior through regulation of the Neuropeptide F (a homologue of Neuropeptide Y). Our study suggests that activity of the NPF/NPF receptor axis represents the state of the fly reward system and modifies behavior accordingly. Modulation of the NPF system by socially rewarding and non-rewarding experiences may thus reflect a broader mechanism by which experience is represented in the brain and converted into changes of circuit function and, eventually, modulation of behavior.  The goal of this proposal is to uncover the molecular and neural mechanisms by which rewarding and non-rewarding experiences are perceived, represented in the brain and converted into modulation of behavior. I will utilize genetic and molecular experiments, initially focusing on the NPF pathway as an inroad pathway, to dissect further the input and output components of this circuit using genetic intersection approach and identify the molecular representation of experience within NPF cells using cell specific transcriptome analysis. In addition we will use state of the art tracking and machine vision technologies to study the effect of social experience on social group dynamics.",0,0
109,197862,No,Molecular and structural pharmacology of adiponectin receptor: towards innovative treatments of obesity-related diseases.,"The human kind is witnessing an escalation of obesity-related health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. A recent groundbreaking study revealed adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR) as key targets for treating such obesity-related diseases. Indeed, the modulation of this integral membrane protein by small molecules agonists ameliorates diabetes and prolongs lifespan of genetically obese rodent model. Despite these exciting results and the importance of ADIPOR in human physiology, there is a complete lack of knowledge of ADIPOR mechanisms of action and pharmacology. This is mainly due to the challenges associated with the characterization of membrane protein structure and function. To fill this gap of knowledge and based on my extensive experience in membrane protein biology, I propose here to characterize the the proximal signaling pathways associated with ADIPOR activation as well as the molecular and structural mechanisms of ADIPOR activation. We will develop an innovative integrated strategy combining state-of-the-art molecular and structural pharmacology approaches including 1) molecular analyses of ADIPOR network of interaction using resonance energy transfer measurement in living cells and a proteomic analysis and 2) structural analyses of ADIPOR and signaling complexes using biophysics and X-ray crystallography. Our data will have a major impact on drug discovery for treating obesity-related diseases as it will enable the application of structure-based drug design and in silico screening for the molecular control of ADIPOR activity. The proposed high-risk endeavor of obtaining structural data on these atypical membrane signaling complexes is a new direction both for my career and for the field of adiponectin biology; the exceptionally high gain from these studies fully justifies the risks; the feasibility of this project is supported by my recent success in membrane protein pharmacology, biochemistry, biophysics and crystallography.",0,0

The existence of such singularities would have important consequences for the understanding of turbulence. One way to make progress in this direction, is to study plausible scenarios for the singularities supported by experiments or numerical analysis. With the more sophisticated numerical tools now available, the subject has recently gained considerable momentum. The main goal of this project is to study analytically several incompressible fluid models. In particular solutions that involve the possible formation of singularities or quasi-singular structures.",0,0
581,91092,No,Advancing knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship and innovation for growth and social well-being in Europe,"The proposed research project will study the interactions between knowledge, economic growth and social wellbeing in Europe. It focuses on knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship as a necessary mechanism and an agent of change mediating between the creation of knowledge and its transformation into economic activity. Knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship is perceived herein as a core interface between two interdependent systems: the knowledge generation and diffusion system, on the one hand, and the productive system, on the other. Both systems shape and are shaped by the broader social context – including customs, culture, and institutions – thus also pointing at the linkage of entrepreneurship to that context. The project has three main objectives (research thrusts). At the micro level, it purports to study in depth the very act of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship, its defining characteristics, boundaries, scope and incentives. At the macro level, it will study the link between knowledge entrepreneurship, economic growth and social wellbeing, also extending to the socio-economic processes that help transform the “animal spirits” (John Maynard Keynes) into a self-reinforcing process for broader societal prosperity. The way the broader socio-economic environment stokes “animal spirits” and benefits from them will be studied within the contexts of various shades of capitalism in Europe and elsewhere, expanding beyond the growth accounting and endogenous growth approaches and issues to novel concepts of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship in growth and, further, into the underlying issues of social wellbeing such as inclusion, cohesion, equity, opportunities, and social care. Finally, at the policy level, the project will take a systemic approach aiming at an organic integration of diverse sets of policies that influence the creation and growth of innovative entrepreneurial ventures based on knowledge generation and diffusion.",0,0
366,214176,No,Axions as the Origin of the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe,"Being one of the great scientific triumphs of the 20th century, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a key ingredient to our current world view. Despite its success, it, however, fails to solve a long-standing puzzle in cosmology that is crucial to our very own existence: Why does the Universe consist only of matter and not antimatter? This observation calls for baryogenesis: a physical process shortly after the Big Bang that creates an imbalance between matter and antimatter. In AxiBAU, I will shed new light on this problem, i.e., the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), and investigate a novel class of cosmological scenarios that relate baryogenesis to the physics of axions: a hypothetical type of particles that appear in many SM extensions. Recently, axions have received a great deal of attention, as their dynamics in the early Universe entail an extremely rich phenomenology. At present, the promising predictions of such cosmological axion models are, however, unreliable, as they ought to be constrained by the observed baryon asymmetry. This is where AxiBAU enters the game: In AxiBAU, I will establish the idea of axion-driven baryogenesis (ADB) as a main alternative to conventional scenarios of baryogenesis. To this end, I will: (1) Study the interplay of all baryogenesis mechanisms in the presence of axions. (2) Develop the numerical tools necessary to achieve a quantitatively reliable prediction of the final BAU. (3) Explore the constraints on other observables such as gravitational waves, primordial black holes, etc. (4) Embed ADB into a bigger picture, connecting it to ideas such as the relaxion, Higgs inflation, etc. I will implement AxiBAU at CERN under the supervision of the Head of the Theoretical Physics Department, Dr. Gian Giudice. I will collaborate with Dr. Gian Giudice as well as with other fellows and visitors at CERN, make use of CERN's unique conditions for research and training, and benefit from CERN's excellent infrastructure.",0,0
48,111115,Yes,Politics of Welfare in Emerging Market Economies,"The research aims at explaining contemporary welfare system transformations in emerging market economies during the last four decades, by considering grassroots political factors. Through a comparative and historical analysis of welfare systems in Brazil, South Korea and Turkey, this project will examine to what extent grassroots politics have shaped welfare policies, focusing on government efforts to contain social unrest and mobilize popular support with the use of social welfare provision. There are two specific hypotheses: Despite similar structural transformations, (i) since the 1990s, Brazilian and Turkish governments have prioritized social assistance programs for the poor over social security programs for employees as a political response to a shift in grassroots politics from the formal to the informal proletariat, (ii) In South Korea, social security programs have remained as the central form of welfare provision because the formal proletariat has continued to act as the fundamental grassroots power. The informal proletariat has become the main source of threat and support for governments under the influence of Islamic and Kurdish movements in Turkey and under the influence of drug traffic in Brazil that controls the Afro-Brazilian dominated favelas. In South Korea, the formal proletariat has still been mobilized largely by powerful trade unions in. Thus, Brazilian state has to deal with criminal organizations and Turkish state with radical political organizations that both radicalize the informal proletariat while South Korean State with labour organizations. Welfare provision has been a critical instrument for government efforts in all cases and the type of grassroots political force that states mainly have to deal with has determined the central type of welfare provision.",1,1

In an attempt to re-evaluate theories relevant to the explanation of current events our Association has undertaken the co-ordination of two international conferences. The first event, organised by the Department of Political Science and Public Administration of the University of Athens and in collaboration with the Department of Political Science of the University of Paris VII, focuses on the role of the contemporary state. The conference takes place on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the death of Nicos Poulantzas Entitled 'Politics Today', it gathers an impressive number of renown academics based in Europe and the USA (see attached programme).  The second conference dwells upon the problematic of democratisation in Europe, focussing on the conditions for and obstacles to democratic practices beyond the nation state. Organised by the Hellenic Political Science Association (HPSA) in collaboration with colleagues from the Bulgarian and German Associations of Political Science, the conference aims at providing a forum discussion of alternative views on the national question and international rights. It should be noted that HPSA is an umbrella organisation grouping political scientists and other practitioners and academics in related disciplines. Based in Athens and linked to sister organisations in both the EU and Balkan countries, our Association can claim to be in a unique position to foster links between academics from different intellectual and cultural backgrounds. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-1999-00168-2.pdf",0,0

516,223710,No,Opinion Dynamics,"In this project I propose to study opinion dynamics in social networks and groups. In particular, I will ask how opinion dynamics contribute to shape social identity and how, conversely, social identity affects communication. I also ask whether and when social identity is a barrier to communication, when “opinion bubbles” are created and when and how “fake news” can spread. The types of social identity I consider include social class, ethnicity and gender. The project consists of four subprojects.  The first subproject [A] focuses on communication between social classes and inequality. The subproject asks how opinion dynamics contribute to diverging experiences, core behaviours and values that go much beyond income inequality. I will first document this divergence by conducting experiments in a representative sample of the UK population via the UK Household panel and then conduct lab experiments to study opinion dynamics and the conditions under which “opinion bubbles” arise in more detail.  Subproject [B] focuses on gender bias in committees. A large body of empirical evidence has documented gender biases in decisions, such as hiring, promotion, or performance evaluations. Many of these decisions involve communication and deliberation among committee members. Nevertheless the role of opinion dynamics in committees in creating or amplifying gender bias has not been explored. Subproject [B] aims to fill this gap.  Subproject [C] will focus on how perceived uncertainty contributes to the spread of discriminatory attitudes with a particular focus on ethnic discrimination. Subproject [C] will be conducted both using a representative sample of the UK population via the Innovation Panel of Understanding Society, the UK Household panel as well as lab experiments.  The last subproject [D] will use lab experiments to study under which conditions opinion dynamics can become vulnerable to “fake news”.",0,0

491,41895,No,Gender and Citizenship: Social Exclusion and Social Integration in European Welfare States,"We propose a series of five seminars for the period 1996-1998 under the theme Gender and Citisenship: Social Integration and Social Exclusion in European Welfare States. We want a) to produce new knowledge about gender as a concept and a variable for analysis in the work on social citizenship by developing a comprehensive approach that focuses on the interplay between social and political dimensions of citizenship. b) to achieve this objective, a state-of-the art summary combining existing approaches to integrate gender in comparative work on social citizenship and welfare regimes will be produced. And more concretely, we want c) to produce a compilation of national case studies that illustrate the multidimensional features of women's social exclusion and their multiple forms of participation in work and politics. Finally, we want d) to develop a new conceptual framework for the comparative study of citizenship in European welfare states by gendering notions of rights, obligations, participation and identities. The basic hypothesis in this proposal is that a framework for women's citizenship involves extending the conceptual and empirical terrain in current citizenship theorizing. Exclusion and integration have different meanings, contexts and dynamics for women and men. This has implications for developing a framework for women's citizenship: Women have been excluded from democratic citizenship and their social citizenship has been defined primarily by their roles as mothers and wives, and only to a smaller degree by their roles as workers. Women rely on different sources of income, provided by either the family/ network/voluntary the labour market, the state or fathers/husbands (Lewis ed.l993): Women's social exclusion is therefore multidimensional Women's citizenship is shaped by a) the extent to which they are as wives and mothers dependent on the labour market/state benefits/husbands, b) the extent to which they are as individuals dependent on labour market/ husbands/state benefits.  Today the institutions of welfare states and of democracy are in transition, and gender is a central aspect. On the level of policies one guiding hypothesis is that policies that increase public responsibility for caringwork, through universal benefits, services and rights for mothers and carers are favourable toward a social integration of women. On the level of democracy, the guiding hypothesis is that women's political citizenship has today become a crucial factor determining women's social rights. Since most European welfare states promote women's labour market participation, one question is who will care for children and the elderly in the post-industrial European wellfare states. The other is whether women will be democratic 'agents' or 'objects' in public policies to restructure welfare and citizenship in the post industrial welfare states.  We have scheduled 5 seminars during the three year period with different themes: 1) The new forms of social integration and social exclusion and new dilemmas connected with women's double roles as 'working mothers'. The multidimensional features of women's exclusion is analysed on the basis of national cases from different European welfare states. Lone mothers as a test case for women's double roles making visible the mixed sources of income (cash and kind) form the labour market, the state, the family network/voluntary sector. 2) The causes of social exclusion and social integration - a discussion of different theoretical approaches to explain gender differences in social rights and political participation in comparative studies of citizenship and welfare regimes: Problems and dilemmas in engendering citizenship. 3) Pub]ic policies toward social exclusion and social integration. What difference does politics makepotentialities and barriers from the perspective of women. National cases that illuminate how policies have both enabled women as workers and mothers, and contributed toward women's social exclusion. 4) The dynamic inter-action of social and political citizenship - the different roles of women and men as social actors in the trade union movement, social movements and political parties. To what extent have women as social actors influenced policies? Cases that demonstrate both conflicts and alliances around equality policies, abortion rights, labour market and social policies. 5) The transition of gender, welfare state and democracy.

375,210546,No,COMPASS: Climate-relevant Ocean Measurements and Processes on the Antarctic continental Shelf and Slope,"Processes on the Antarctic continental shelf and slope are crucially important for determining the rate of future sea level rise, setting the properties and volume of dense bottom water exported globally, and regulating the carbon cycle. Yet our ability to model and predict these processes over future decades remains rudimentary. This deficiency in understanding originates in a lack of observations in this inaccessible region. The COMPASS project seeks to rectify that by exploiting new technology - autonomous marine vehicles called gliders - to observe, quantify and elucidate processes on the continental shelf and slope of Antarctica that are important for climate.  The COMPASS objective is to make a step-change in our quantitative understanding of:  (i) the ocean front that marks the boundary between the Antarctic continental shelf and the open ocean, and its associated current system;  (ii) the interaction between ocean, atmosphere and sea-ice on the Antarctic continental shelf; and  (iii) the exchange of heat, salt and freshwater with the cavities beneath ice shelves.   These goals will be met by a series of targeted ocean glider campaigns around Antarctica, spanning different flow regimes, including areas where warm water is able to access the continental shelf and influence ice shelves, areas where the continental shelf is cold and fresh, and areas where the continental shelf hosts cold, salty, dense water that eventually spills into the abyss. A unique circumpolar assessment of ocean properties and dynamics, including instabilities and mixing, will be undertaken. COMPASS will develop new technology to deploy a profiling glider into inaccessible environments such as Antarctic polynyas (regions of open water surrounded by sea-ice). As well as scientific breakthroughs that will feed into future climate assessments, improving projections of future sea level rise and global temperatures, COMPASS will deliver enhanced design for future ocean observing systems.",0,0
596,91218,No,Diffusion of administrative and regulatory innovations in OECD and EU member states,"This research project is about the diffusion of administrative reforms, focusing on innovations in regulatory process. The literature on administrative reform and New Public Management (NPM) has generally overlooked the determinants of the spread of innovations among developed and developing countries. Moreover, the vast majority of diffusion studies in political science tend to focus on adoption and ignore the stages prior and after the point at which the decision is made. This project aims to pursue the following set of research objectives: i) deriving a theoretical framework; ii) constructing datasets on the years of adoption of administrative reforms, selecting three units of analysis; iii) analysing prerequisites and selecting diffusion determinants; iv) analysing internal and external determinants of diffusion; v) analysing successive stages of innovation process. This project will provide general insights into the ways OECD and EU countries have balanced accountability and legitimacy on the one hand and efficiency on the other.

The big data is an essential pillar of the IoE . Thus, including more explicitly persons and data concerning them, IoE cannot be limited to engineering and computer science, but is a topic that needs to be investigated with scientific interdisciplinary researches under different perspectives: technical, legal, economical, ethical, philosophical point of view: it “involves a complex and evolving set of technological, social, and policy considerations across a diverse set of stakeholders.” Privacy, Intellectual Proprietary Rights, Data Ownership, Super-control of people behavior, Fundamental Rights, Ethical principles are critical issues that could determine the success of IoE in the market .

602,45878,No,On line continuous aroma extraction from agrofood processing wastes,"The main objective of this project is to develop a new technology on resins which will enable extraction and selective recovery of aromatic compounds from food processing wastes. Indeed, nowadays, food industry does not have technologies efficient enough to avoid aromatic losses and to recover the whole aromatic compounds of the product. It results in many losses and biochemical changes which affect the quality of the extracted flavour. The main objectives of the project are: * The development of a continuous process to recover flavours from agro-food processing wastes on-line. This is an important innovation as actual processes are batch one. This is a necessary goal in order to achieve the economical viability for the system.* Improvements for the agro-food industry: amelioration of the taste by using natural reinforcements at low cost.* Taking into account the increasing demand of high quality natural products from consumers. Consumers are now more aware of green issues and are rejecting artificial substances in favour of natural alternative. There is a growing trend in favour of aromatic extracts for a number of large scale uses, including flavouring, fragrances, agricultural, pharmaceutical or medicinal preparations.* Conversion of environmentally-unfriendly wastes into food or non food ingredients. There is considerable industrial and political pressure to convert wastes into useful products. This project will bring together European partners to develop means for exploiting wastes for the extraction of high quality and commercially valuable products. SMEs will be very interested in the results of the project because they will find a new way to valorise their wastes with a high added value. Indeed, the flavour consuming branches of activity are a very interesting target for agro-food industry.The economic gain will be important. Many studies have been carried out in the wine industry (the added value of the recovered product represent up to 5% per bottle) results obtained could be easily extrapolated to other products (fruit, beer...).

932,187690,No,The land of Caesar: Geography and economy of the imperial properties in Roman Asia Minor,"The LanCRAM project aims at studying the geographical distribution and the economic, social and political impact of the properties of the Roman emperors in Asia Minor. These consisted of villas, landed estates, pastureland, woods, mines and quarries. This immense richness was a key element for the maintenance of the position of supreme power, since the emperor could use it to confer social status to individuals or to perform benefactions in favour of communities. Furthermore, imperial properties produced undeniable economic repercussions on the regions where they had a considerable extension. Since their owner was both the head of the empire and a global economic player, we can trace a tendency to trans-regional uniformity in the patterns of exploitation and a positive effect on the integration of rural areas in the political and economic system of the empire. No major survey of the available documentation has been produced since the beginning of the 20th century and many questions about the development and use of the properties remain unanswered. The project aims at filling this gap in three ways. (1) The development of a powerful online relational database of all published sources for the proposed area; every record will contain geodata and will be related to separate databases of all known persons (administrators, peasants etc.), regions and bibliographic references. (2) The preparation of a monograph on the geography and the economy of the imperial properties in Asia Minor from Augustus to Diocletian (27 BC-AD 284). This region is one of the best documented for the Roman period and offers a variety of geographical, cultural and administrative contexts that allow to study the subject from a multidisciplinary perspective; (3) the organisation of two workshops and an international conference  together with experts of other regions in order to open the database to different areas of the empire and provide for the first time a general overview of the documentation.",0,0

Special attention is paid to target groups of policies and access conditions to programmes.  -to analyse the extent to which the provision of skills has been linked to other forms of welfare provision (such as employment benefits) in the two cases.  -to explain how labour market and welfare institutional arrangements, as well as supranational policies (i.e. European Community initiatives) influence the outcomes of training policies.  The British and the Spanish cases have not been studied comparatively so far, and one of the innovative aspects of the approach will be the simultaneous use of institutional and economic variables intervening in the processes of unemployment and training.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The acquisition of deep knowledge about the functioning of British labour markets and the links between unemployment, the profile of training provision and the evolution of skills in that country is essential for the comparison I want to make between the British and the Spanish case of which I already have some knowledge from previous exploratory research During my years of study I have acquired some basic statistical skills. Training in the use and analysis of British longitudinal socioeconomic data will greatly benefit my project in the sense that I could developed the necessary skills in more advanced data analysis.",0,0
236,91076,No,"Money, Liquidity, and the Aggregate Economy","In the last few years, Professor Nobuhiro Kiyotaki (Princeton) and I have attempted to provide the bare bones of a simple, unified theory of money and liquidity that can be integrated into the rest of macroeconomic theory, staying as close as possible to the standard competitive macroeconomic framework. But there is a lot of work ahead. The bones have little or no flesh. Here are some of the major puzzles that are outstanding. Why is it that small adjustments to nominal interest rates by a central bank appear to have such significant effects on the real economy? Why can there be financial instability, even during periods of monetary stability? What are the deep sources of a financial crisis? Has it to do with contractual incompleteness, such as lack of indexation in debt contracts? What externalities may be at work? Is there scope for intervention, to encourage new forms of financial contract, such as  dequity    which offer lenders the same control rights as debt but afford the same degree of risk sharing as equity? Through what mechanism do financial crises spread, both across markets and across countries? Does contagion occur through price effects alone (e.g. falls in the values of collateral), or is the primary channel of propagation through chains of debt and default? How and when might monetary policy ameliorate financial crises? And how does this role for a central bank connect to its role of lender of last resort? As new financial instruments emerge that substitute for fiat money, what is the future of central banking? More generally, how should monetary economics tie in with the economics of payment and settlement? Inevitably, it is difficult to prescribe where our research will take us. Not all of these questions will prove amenable to being answered. It may be that some alternative line of enquiry opens up unexpectedly.",0,0
399,208588,No,Designing Multifunctional Self-Limiting Assembled Nanocrystal Superstructures and Monitoring their Self-Assembly at High Spatiotemporal Resolution,"This project focuses on the self-limited self-assembly of nanocrystals that involves inorganic particles assembling into highly ordered terminal structures. The design of such structures is still challenging but offers many perspectives for templating assemblies of desired shape and size, and for several applications ranging from optoelectronics to energy storage and biosensing. In this scope, the objectives of the proposal are structured around three main stages: (i) the chemical design of uniformly sized, hybrid magnetic/non-magnetic systems, (ii) the monitoring of the self-assembly reaction in situ using real-time measurement techniques, and (iii) the characterization of the effect of an applied external field on the morphology of the assembled structures. The chemical design methodology of the self-limiting complex particles will be investigated along with Prof. Nicholas Kotov (University of Michigan, USA) during the outgoing phase. X-ray scattering/imaging experiments yielding high spatiotemporal resolution will be performed in large-scale synchrotron facilities in the USA as well as in Europe during the return phase along with Prof. Andrei Petukhov (Utrecht University, Netherlands) with whom the effect of an applied magnetic field will be further studied. A collaboration between the two host institutes in Europe and USA will take place through this fellowship and will involve the competences of the three parties: in chemical engineering of hierarchical assemblies in solution (Prof. Kotov), in X-ray scattering/imaging for studying the self-organization of colloids (Prof. Petukhov) and in data analysis/modeling and X-ray scattering (the fellow Law-Hine). The project should bring new insights into the mechanisms of formation of self-limiting, multifunctional nanoparticles and provide strategies for designing these particles using external control fields.",0,0

262,93584,No,Repair Spinal Cord Injury by Controlling Migration of Neural Stem Cells - multidiciplinary approaches of electric stimulation and nanotechnology,"Millions of people worldwide suffer from spinal cord injury (SCI), with devastating consequences and costs. Various clinical approaches have been attempted to treat SCI with little satisfaction due to the limitation of self-regeneration of axons. Neural stem cell transplantation is an alternative approach with great potential to treat SCI, but the mechanisms controlling migration of implanted stem cells are unclear. A recent SCI clinical trial using implanted electric stimulators to promote axon regeneration showed promising results. However, the mechanism underpinning this technique also remains elusive. We shall investigate genes and molecules regulating the electric fields controlled neural stem cells migration. We have shown before that electric signals play essential roles in directing cell migration during wound healing, and that PI3K and PTEN are critical in the regulation of this event (Zhao, Song et al. Nature 2006). Pax6 and ephrin are also proved to be important in guiding cell migration, however the interactions between PI3K, PTEN and Pax6, Eph-ephrin pathways are unknown. We shall further investigate their potential interactions in this project.. Apart from electric signals, neural stem cell migration can be also regulated by chemical, physical, and haptotactic guidance cues. This project shall use multidisciplinary approaches to combine neural stem cells transplantation with electric stimulation and nanotechnology, to optimize a novel stem cell replacement therapy. We shall use multiple peptide structures to engineer diverse adhesion peptide motifs on the nanofibers, and embed EGF/bFGF into 3D nanofibers scaffold to encapsulate neural stem cells for the transplantation study. These shall be tested in both 2D / 3D in vitro and in SCI animal models in vivo.",0,0
854,46557,No,Pan-European lightwave core and access network,"Main Objective   The overall objective of project PELICAN is to demonstrate the feasibility of an end-to-end, managed, large-scale photonic network, including transport and access.  To this end, project PELICAN will integrate, in a single Pan-European field trial, several optical networking test-beds implemented in three on-going ACTS projects. These projects are :    -OPEN (AC066), which demonstrated the feasibility of an optical Pan-European backbone network in which Wavelength-Division-Multiplexing (WDM) is fully exploited for both transmission and routing;    -MEPHISTO (AC209), whose objective is to extend the principles of the Telecommunication Management Network (TMN) to manage WDM photonic backbone networks; and    -PLANET (AC050), which investigates the concept of ATM SuperPON (Passive Optical Network) access networks.   Technical Approach   To meet this goal, the project has been organised in 4 work-packages.  WP0 will be responsible for the project management and liaison with the ACTS horizontal projects.  WP1 The definition and specifications of the field trial and its evaluation will be carried out in WP1. In particular, the following tasks will be realised:    -Definition of the field trial in terms of network topology, infrastructure, services, and specifications of the equipment, components, and management systems.    -Feasibility assessment of the field trial through modelling and laboratory experiments.    -Laboratory integration of the equipment and of the management systems prior to the field installation.    -Evaluation of the field trial.    -Demonstration of advanced services in collaboration with the service providing projects.  WP2 is dedicated to the adaptation of the OPEN (transport) and PLANET (SuperPON) hardware according to the specifications.    -On the access side, the SuperPON will be equipped with a dynamic Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol in the upstream direction. This protocol will provide a significant gain in the statistical multiplexing and thus will allow a more efficient sharing of the available bandwidth between multiple end-users. Combined with the flexibility of ATM, it will create new opportunities for providing multimedia services to small business and residential customers.    -On the transport side, the wavelength cross-connects will be upgraded in size (higher connectivity) and/or in bit-rate granularity (demonstration of routing at 10 Gbit/s). In addition, new, lower complexity optical nodes will be assembled. Network elements, including the optical amplifiers, will integrate the hardware necessary for the OA&M and network management functions as defined within MEPHISTO.  WP3 The adaptation of the management systems of both the core and access networks to the field trial specifications will be performed in WP3.    -On the SuperPON side, the control messages will be transported via an ATM VP/VC channel directly on the system infrastructure, thus eliminating the need for an external data communication network.    -On the transport side, TMN-compatible performance monitoring facilities will be added to the agent developed for all the optical nodes. Management applications (configuration, fault, and performance) developed within MEPHISTO will also be adapted to the new field trial requirements. Finally, agents will be integrated with the hardware equipment and interoperability with the managers will be verified.   Summary of Trial   The main outcome of the PELICAN project will be a trans-border field trial built on the OPEN, MEPHISTO and PLANET test-beds. This integrated trial will consist of managed transport and access networks as follows:  A managed optical transport network, interconnecting French and Belgian cities by means of high-capacity optical fibre links cross-connected through transparent photonic nodes. This network, built upon an existing fibre infrastructure (G.652 fibre), will heavily rely on the use of WDM for both transmission and routing. Two network partitions of different topologies will be considered and managed according to the OA&M concepts developed within project MEPHISTO:    -a meshed backbone network composed of wavelength cross-connects, with or without wavelength conversion (from the OPEN project); the channel rate in this core network will be 2.5 and 10 Gbit/s;    -a two-fibre unidirectional ring regional network composed of three fully reconfigurable Wavelength Add-Drop Multiplexers (from the MEPHISTO project). Each ring section will support four wavelength channels at a rate of 2.5 Gbit/s. A centrally-managed optical access network, of the SuperPON type, in a Fibre-To-The-Building (FTTB) configuration. The PON will bridge a distance of 100 km and support a large splitting factor (2000), though only a limited number of subscribers will actually be connected. The bi-directional transfer mode will rely on TDM transmission in the 1550 nm window and at a bit rate of 2.5 Gbit/s in the downstream direction, and on TDMA transmission at 1300 nm and at 311 Mbit/s in the upstream direction.  Applications (such as ATM and IP/ATM, etc.) and services (such as interactive multimedia, distant learning interactive, collaborative work, etc.) identified during the definition phase of the field trial will be demonstrated over the PELICAN infrastructure.   Physical topology of project PELICAN field trial Expected Achievements    -Inter-working of an optical WDM transport network with an optical full-service access network    -Comparison of different optical technologies, and evaluation of their reliability in a field environment    -Demonstration of various types of advanced optical network elements and of their inter-networking    -Field demonstration of a TMN-compatible management system for WDM transport networks    -Demonstration of an efficient dynamic MAC protocol for access networks    -Demonstration of a centrally managed SuperPON network.

954,189974,No,Self-organizing Performance Prediction and Optimization for Large-scale Software Systems,"The scope of SPANDO (Self-organising Performance Prediction and Optimisation for Large-scale Software Systems) is to contribute to the development of decentralised self-optimising software systems. The project focuses on the conceptual foundations and engineering techniques on the use of run-time performance prediction models and self-organising adaptation strategies to achieve a decentralised performance optimisation of the system.  Current research in the area of self-adaptive systems is moving towards solutions to adaptation problems with the aim to engineer systems that can quickly respond to changes without any human intervention. As systems are becoming larger and more complex, the adoption of solutions that are both decentralised and scalable is becoming increasingly important. Up to now, this research area has focused on producing approaches to support the actuation of decentralised adaptation actions, however the problem of deciding when and how to execute them is still challenging in a decentralised setting. SPANDO proposes to solve such problem by using performance prediction models that are being studied in operations research and applied probability research. The most common prediction models that are already being used at run-time are based on Continuous-Time Markov Chains. However, these existing techniques have scalability limitations due to the state-space explosion of the CTMC formalism. The SPANDO project will overcome these limitations by studying a new class of performance prediction models that can be evaluated in a decentralised way, without any explicit coordination. The proposed models will use formalisms based on ordinary differential equations, such as fluid and mean-field analysis, and have the particularity of being independent of the size of the system. The results of the evaluations of these models will then be used at run-time as inputs for proper decentralised adaptation actions.",0,0

Electronic Portfolios (e-portfolios) for workplace training provide a global view of each trainee's progress but offer no dynamic feedback to exploit the rich learning assessment data that could be analysed to support responsive adaptation for more efficient and rewarding training.<br/>WATCHME effectively deploys Learning Analytics (LA) tools to deliver personalised learning; supporting learner empowerment, enhanced Quality-of-Experience, flexibility and mobility plus efficiency gains through workplace-based feedback and assessment. This is achieved by developing, implementing and evaluating a mobile, electronic portfolio-based system that utilises LA and student models to provide data-driven and model-based tailored feedback via a visualisation dashboard. The multi-sourced integrated deployment of authentic workplace data including self-reporting, narratives, qualitative and quantitative data e.g. videos and serious educational games enables the WATCHME trainees to exercise and thereby sharpen their learnt skills by responding to realistically situated judgment calls in a motivational and safe environment.<br/>A Multi-entity Bayesian Network will be used for the student models, enabling an aggregation of data and tailored Just-in-Time feedback, visualised via intuitive interfaces. The close cooperation of educational researchers and ICT developers will deliver a tool to map critical professional tasks linked to their requisite competencies and markers for feedback and assessment in the workplace integrated with an easy access electronic portfolio system for data collection and LA-driven tools to inform trainees, teachers and supervisors about the trainee's progress and deliver personalised Just-in-Time feedback with intuitive visualisation tools.<br/>The WATCHME platform will be empirically validated for its quality and contribution to trainees' learning.

926,198175,No,"Digital Crossings in Europe: Gender, Diaspora and Belonging","Many immigrants enter Europe both legally and illegally every year. This creates multiple challenges for the Union, including the gender and ethnic segregation of migrant groups, especially women. While it strives for an inclusive and integrated society as envisioned by the EU motto ‘Unity in Diversity’, it is still often perceived more as ‘Fortress Europe.’ This project focuses on the ‘connected migrant’, studying how virtual communities of migrants, or digital diasporas, convey issues of technology, migration, globalisation, alienation and belonging capturing the lives of migrants in their interaction with multiple worlds and media.  More specifically, it will investigate whether digital technologies enhance European integration or foster gender and ethnic segregation, and, if so, how. Using a multi-layered and cutting-edge approach that draws from the humanities, social science and new media studies (i.e. internet studies and mobile media), this research considers: 1. How migration and digital technologies enable digital diasporas (Somali, Turkish, Romanian) and the impact these have on identity, gender and belonging in European urban centres; 2. How these entanglements are connected to and perceived from outside Europe by focusing on transnational ties; and 3. How digital connections create new possibilities for cosmopolitan outlooks, rearticulating Europe’s motto of ‘Unity in Diversity.’  The outcomes of this work will be innovative at three levels. a) Empirically, the project gathers, maps and critically grounds online behaviour by migrant women from a European comparative perspective. b) Methodologically, it breaks new ground by developing new methods of analysis for digital diasporas contributing to the development of ‘postcolonial’ digital humanities. c) Conceptually, it integrates colonial and migrant relations into the idea of Europe, elaborating on the notion of cosmopolitan belonging through virtual connectivity.",0,0
84,210647,No,Constructed wetland to produce high-quality drinking water free from nitrates,"Three out of four people in EU drink water from groundwater subjected to severe nitrate contamination by fertilizers and sanitary products used in intensive agriculture & farming. High levels of nitrates in drinking water put human health at risk and have been reported to threaten 26% of EU biodiversity. Current technologies do not meet the needs of small water suppliers, who must face costs derived from high energy consumption (3-7 kWh/m3), poor nitrate selectivity, residual streams and by-products, and continuous costly maintenance. 33% of suppliers in Europe are not compliant with quality standards, particularly nitrate levels. ZIRONITRO is the result of 8 years of research and development by Ofra Aqua Plants, an Israeli company with over 25 years’ experience in bioengineering and phytoremediation. Based on the concept of using nature to cleanse nature, ZIRONITRO is a constructed wetland to biologically treat groundwater by removing nitrates to obtain high-quality drinking water (98% removal), at 84% lower cost than current. ZIRONITRO’s innovation resides in the system’s nitrate removal specificity, with a design that allows low-cost operation and maintenance, along with very high rates of nitrate breakdown by bacteria. The key factor is the selection of the best combination of both bacteria and plants, along with the optimal proportion of methanol as carbon source. The particular environment we have generated inside our ponds reduces hydraulic retention time by 90% and uses 100 times less ethanol than current constructed wetlands. Indeed, we do not use synthetic chemicals, energy input needed is negligible, and neither residuals nor wastewater are generated, so it has no negative impact on the environment. On the contrary, it contributes to both biodiversity conservation and landscape value. For 2020-2022, we forecast €61.3 M cumulative revenues (profitability ratio of 12%), increasing workforce to 40 people.",0,0

667,197560,No,Laser bonding of linear edged super-abrasive blades,"C4 Carbides of Cambridge (UK) are a manufacturer and supplier of linear edge abrasive blades to many of the world’s biggest brand names in power tool accessories, and industrial cutting and machining equipment. We have identified laser metal deposition (LMD) - additive manufacturing techniques – as a revolutionary new way to manufacture profiled super-abrasive coated linear edge blades.  This has the potential to create a new product category across both the power tool accessories market and the machining and fabrication industry.    Currently, most linear edge blades have teeth, formed by machining bimetal strip or by welding solid tungsten carbide pieces to steel strip then grinding them to shape.  When they are used to cut many modern composite materials, toothed blades blunt very quickly.  An alternative is ‘abrasive blades’ which have bonded tungsten carbide grit to steel strip or electroplated diamond blades; while these are available, they are expensive and have limited life due to insufficient bond strength.  C4 Carbides has been developing techniques to improve these blades using a braze to bond diamond and cBN grit to steel.  This improves the performance of the cutting edge but requires the entire assembly to be heated, reducing the backing strip life by up to 40% - which makes it only a niche product.   We believe that using LMD would allow finished and polished backing material to be coated and heated on the top surface to depth of less than 0.3 mm; achieving the required strength and flexibility and using 75% less energy in manufacture. Furthermore, using this method will open up a large range of variable and complex tool geometries to be cost-effectively fabricated.  The ultimate aim of the project is to scope and develop an automated production facility using LMD.  The initial expectation is to supply 10% of the $2bn blade market through C4’s global sales network, though it is envisaged that all blades will eventually be made using this technology.",0,0
63,83049,Yes,Environmental justice and inequality in Europe,"The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice (EJ) as the fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. EJ policies are intended to overcome environmental inequalities caused by racial and economic advantages built into policy-making, enforcement, and locating of waste disposal and polluting industries. Most research on Environmental Justice demonstrates that there are disparities by race and class in the distribution of environmental hazards, whether defined by facility location, emissions, ambient concentrations of air pollution, or environmental enforcement and clean-up activities. Environmental justice is a relatively unexplored but growing policy area in Europe. There are a number of European laws and directives that specifically relate to developing access to environmental information, participation and decision- making.  Environmental Justice may offer new insights into the juncture of social inequality and public health in Europe and may provide a framework for EU policy discussions on the impact of discrimination on the environmental health of diverse communities. Within the present research project we aim at quantifying the concept of environmental justice for Europe. In our analysis we will analyse the issue of environmental equity linked mainly to three sets of variables: variables linked to economic welfare, variables linked to environmental stress, and variables connected with public health. The analyses will investigate the distribution of environmental costs amongst different demographic groups (i.e. low income, ethnical minorities) in Europe, with a focus on the Netherlands and Italy.

597,16980,No,Vulnerable Road User Traffic Observation and Optimization,"The work in VRU-TOO is targeted specifically at the reduction of risk and minimization of delay to vulnerable road users, namely pedestrians. To achieve this, the project links implementations with behavioural studies of the micro-level interaction of pedestrians and vehicles. Research is being carried out in order to reduce risk and minimize delay to vulnerable road users, namely pedestrians. The project links detection techniques with behavioural studies of the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles. The implementations take the form of pilot projects in cities in both northern and southern Europe involving the application of advanced detector systems to improve conditions for pedestrians, particularly at signalized junctions and crossings. Behavioural work is being carried out to create detailed rules for the normal (safe) and abnormal (unsafe) interaction of pedestrians and vehicles.  A review has been undertaken of all the existing technologies for detecting pedestrians. Simultaneously, the feasibility phase for all the implementations has been conducted and reports delivered for the Portuguese and Greek sites where the design phase is now under way. In all cases, cooperation with the respective cities is continuing and it is expected that the installations will take place as planned and on time.  The behavioural work has started with the formulation of initial hypotheses and a specification of the variables and data need to formulate the rules on pedestrian car interaction. Collection of the data required for the empirical formulation of a set of rules is complete in the 4 countries concerned. Conflict studies are being coordinated with video observations and the first round of analysis of the data has been carried out. The analysis indicates that at nonsignalized intersections pedestrian behaviour is the main predictor of conflict occurrence, whereas at signalized intersections vehicle factors have the most important role.  The computer modelling work is implementing the pedestrian meso model from V1031 in Portugal. Simultaneously agreement is being reached on the specification of an improved version of the model. Technical Approach   The implementations will take the form of pilot projects in cities in both northern and southern Europe. They will involve the application of advanced detector systems to improve conditions for pedestrians, particularly at signalized junctions and crossings. The northern European implementation will involve the application of these techniques to a large city-centre scheme, where pedestrian needs will conflict with those of vehicle traffic. The systems will be designed in such a way as to obtain the maximum safety and minimum delay for VRUs, with as little inconvenience to motorized traffic as possible. Two smaller implementations will be conducted at urban locations in Portugal and Greece, where once again it is difficult to satisfy both the needs of pedestrians and those of vehicles. This work will verify the applicability of the same detection techniques in different environments.   At the same time, the project will carry out the necessary behavioural work to create detailed rules for the normal (safe) and abnormal (unsafe) interaction of pedestrians and vehicles. These rules will initially be developed independently of the pilot project locations, but the rules generated will be used in the behavioural evaluation of the pilot projects. This will make it possible to go beyond the normal assessment of such schemes in terms of success or failure, by making it possible to obtain an understanding of how the behaviour of pedestrians and vehicle drivers is affected by the schemes and therefore of what the requirements for success are. This work will permit the generalization of project results to other locations and other types of implementation.   Together with the results of the experimental work, the behavioural rules will provide the necessary tools for future application of the project's methods and techniques for solving the problems of vulnerable road users.   Key Issues    reliable detection of VRUs  the incorporation of passive detection of pedestrians into traffic schemes  variation in pedestrian response to implementations incorporating the ATT technology  changes in pedestrian-vehicle interaction resulting from the implementations  prediction of the outcome of future implementations   Expected Achievements At present, pedestrians encounter significant safety and mobility problems when crossing major roads in urban areas. The project implementations are intended to demonstrate that the systems, developed in DRIVE I for improving pedestrian comfort and safety at signalized crossings, can be incorporated into large-scale urban traffic schemes, where the pedestrian signals are linked to urban traffic control systems. They are also intended to demonstrate that these systems are viable in a number of countries, in both northern and southern Europe. The costs of such VRU implementations will still be comparatively low, especially when compared with the overall cost of most traffic schemes. The potential benefits, in a situation where time and safety for VRUs can at present often be obtained only at the expense of considerable congestion for vehicular traffic, will be large. It is therefore confidently expected that, if the implementations prove viable, these techniques will become commonplace in the future. Such fut re implementations will be greatly assisted by the behavioural rules and modelling tools to be developed. These will provide a source of knowledge, advice and prediction, and will therefore constitute an essential set of tools in the design of future schemes.   Expected Impact   The project is expected to verify that ATT techniques that incorporate the passive detection of pedestrians can be incorporated into traffic signal control in a variety of environments in such a way as to improve vulnerable road user comfort and safety. The project will also demonstrate the feasibility of using such techniques together with advanced means of traffic control.   Contribution to Standardisation   It is expected that the techniques applied in the pedestrian crossing facilities to be implemented will become the basis for future national and European standards.",0,0
628,65167,No,Membrane emulsification in the chemical industry,"Emulsification is an important technology in the chemical industry. Many products are emulsions (coatings, margarines, ointments, etc.) or produced with help of emulsions. Traditionally emulsions are made using colloid mills, rotor-stator systems and homogenizers. The quality of emulsions is often essential for the application/quality of the end product. Recently, a new emulsification technique based on micro-filtration membranes has been introduced for e.g. margarine and slow release drugs applications in the food and pharmaceutical industry . The objective of the research project is to develop end products (emulsions) with well-defined properties and reduced emulsifier contents, as emulsifiers may be harmful for the environment. The research work comprises 1 ) the preparation and tuning of the properties of micro-filtration membranes, 2) the characterization of micro-filtration membranes, 3) the study of emulsification phenomena at various process conditions (type of emulsifier, concentrations of to be dispersed substances, flow velocity, pressure, temperature, etc.), 4) the study of the properties of the resulting emulsions (stability, droplet size, etc.) and 5) the modeling of the experimental data. A team of experts from different areas including process engineers, emulsion experts and product specialists will guide the fellow. In view of the generic nature of the proposed research, the work constitutes an eminent opportunity for training young and ambitious post-graduates in the exciting field of emulsion techniques and optimizing of production processes in an industrial research environment.",0,0
636,98349,No,Tools for the Large Hadron Collider - from the Lagrangian to the experimental analysis,"This collaborative project is in the area of Elementary Particle Physics Phenomenology, with focus on some extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics and top quark physics. It brings together theoretical and experimental particle physicists. The proposed collaboration is a research programme where the applicant's expertise on the theoretical aspects of nonstandard Higgs production and the search of new physics in top quark production and decay in proton-proton collisions is matched with the expertise at the host institution as a part of the European network the applicant is building.  We are especially interested in the search for the Higgs boson, the last particle (or particles) of the SM, that still remains to be experimentally discovered. The Higgs boson is potentially the key to answer the fundamental mystery of why elementary particles have mass. Its search is therefore the primary goal for CERN's Large Hadron Collider. New physics can also be hidden in the top quark, the heaviest of all known fermions. Our main goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the world of particle physics, by proposing theoretical models in the above area and developing and optimizing tools and data analysis techniques to experimentally detect their signatures.  The expertise and skills of the the parties in this proposed collaboration (where not only the host institution takes part but also other institutions in Portugal and in the UK) match and complement each other extremely well. Exploring this synergy will produce a very fruitful collaboration, mutually advantageous to both parties.

The Wireless World Research Forum (WWRF) has set out a vision of the future where 7 trillion wireless devices will be serving 7 billion people by 2017. The vast majority of wireless traffic will be between machines in remote locations. However, wireless communication networks have been designed mainly with human users in mind. And while scale and type of M2M applications are growing rapidly over today's cellular networks, they are still defined following mainly human's communication requirements. To meet the requirements of M2M applications, a new kind of network is needed to serve efficiently a huge number of devices which may have rather modest communications needs.The project will work towards meeting following main aims: To develop and provide a new architecture to support efficient and cost-effective wireless M2M communications. To provide energy efficient wide area coverage for M2M applications such as wireless sensor networks. To extend the scalability of the LTE infrastructure with the aim to extend the range of applications to very cost sensitive 'mobile narrowband' applications. To develop a cost, spectrum and energy efficient radio access technology for M2M applications, adapted to coexist within a high capacity LTE network. To increase energy efficiency of devices, as they may need to be autonomous for months or years.

906,222898,No,Multiplexed biosensing and tissue-on-a-chip integrated platform for breast cancer biomarkers monitoring,"In this project I will develop an integrated multi-module platform in which a breast cancer ecosystem-on-a-chip (BCE-on-a-chip) bioreactor module, connected to an optical biosensing module based on multiplexed Resonant Nanopillars (R-NPs) transducers, will be developed for biomarkers and anti-breast cancer drug real-time monitoring.  Currently attrition rates in clinical trials for new anti-cancer drugs and personalized treatments are higher than all other therapeutic areas. Mainly due to the great reliability on conventional 2D and 3D scaffolds in-vitro culture methodologies in preclinical studies. Those cell-based models are limited by their  inability to conserve the patient tumor features and do not accurately show drug response, observed later in clinical trials. Due to the increasing number of cancer diagnoses, an engineered system that allows an accurate prediction of patient tumor response to anti-cancer drug, is urgently needed.  In Bitform Project I will develop a BCE-on-a-chip bioreactor that intends to conserve the cancer tissue characteristics with high reliability. Breast cancer cell secreted biomarkers will be monitored in real-time with a multiplexed biosensing module based on R-NPs. In order to assess the capability of Bitform platform, an anti-cancer drug demonstrator (Paclitaxel) will be tested. By delivering Paclitaxel to the BCE-on-a-chip, monitoring of different cell secreted target biomarkers will permit to evaluate the effect of this drug, and thus to demonstrate the performance of the platform. The Bitform platform will be suitable for different organ-on-chip culture models and biomolecules monitoring secreted by the cells. This will lead to a new methodology for testing anti-cancer therapies on-a-chip. This is a relevant milestone to study the further potential of the Bitform Platform in personalized medicine, which can have a transformative impact not only on the outcome but also on the costs of treatments by avoiding expensive failures.",0,0

804,5602,No,European subpolar ocean programme : sea ice-ocean interactions,"The overall objective is to understand the role played by the sea ice in the energetics of the Greenland Sea system as a whole, and in the specific ice-ocean interactions involved in the process of deep convection in the winter Greenland Sea with its attendant sequestration of carbon dioxide.   To accomplish the overall objective it is necessary to investigate the Greenland Sea on two scales: Basin-wide studies, to determine the large-scale role of the ice cover, and Mesoscale studies in the region of the Odden ice tongue, Boreas Basin and centre of Greenland Gyre, to determine the mechanisms by which sea ice is involved in deep convection in winter, and to estimate CO2 uptake through cooling, convection and biological fixation.   On the basin-wide scale the programme will study:  * the seasonal extent and variability of sea ice;  * the dynamics of the ice;  * its mass flux;  * the exchanges of fresh water and heat between the ice and the upper ocean;  * large-scale air-sea energy interactions in the region; (vi) carbon chemistry; and  * spring bloom dynamics.   This will be done using:  * satellite remote sensing techniques to monitor ice extent, concentration, tupes and velocity;  * the physics of deep convection and its relationship to air-sea-ice interaction mechanisms;  * CO2 uptake during convection events and surface cooling; (iv) the air-sea fluxes of momentum, moisture and heat;  * aerosol concentration and composition; and  * the dynamics of the spring plankton bloom and its impact on CO2 sequestration.   This will be done using:  * direct shipborne measurements by acoustic and oceanographic sensors of the nature and structure of convective plumes and/or chimneys;  * shipborne measurements of the carbon system and carbon dioxide absorption in the convection region;  * airborne and satellite remote sensing of young ice variability in the convection region;  * bringing together of experimental and modelling results in a synthesis of the convection process and its climatic role.   The approach on two scales enables the two ways in which sea ice contributes to the energetics of the Greenland Sea to be assessed in an integrated programme. On the large scale, most of the sea ice in the Greenland Sea enters from the Arctic Basin via Fram Strait, and contributes a fresh water flux at a range of latitudes to the surface waters. It also affects ocean-atmosphere energy exchanges. The large scale programme will map the flux of ice into the greenland Sea, its rate of melt, and energy exchanges in the ice-covered zone, using satellite remote sensing for extent and type; moored and mobile sonars for thickness; shipborne cruises for energy exchanges; and an extensive modelling programme to integrate the results into large scale ocean-atmosphere models.   Some sea ice in winter also forms within the Greenland Sea itself, and the salt flux associated with rapid ice growth is thought to be a critical factor in the onset of deep convection, which is a vitally important process from a climatic point of view since it leads to carbon dioxide transport into the deep ocean and to renewal of the deep waters themselves. The region where this interaction occurs has been identified as the Odden ice tongue in the mid-latitude Greenland Sea. This will be studied by an intensive shipborn programme throughout the winter and spring period, using acoustic and float techniques to locate and measure the plumes themselves, hydrographic surveys to measure the impact of the convection on ocean structure, biological sampling to estimate carbon fluxes, and finer resolution remote sensing to examine the sea ice changes which occur concurrently with the convection process.",0,0

While this is a reality, its effectiveness is bound to a series of factors, like the suitability of the agents involved in its setting-up, the strategic alliances built, and the awareness raised on the potential resistances –both tangible and intangible- that are to be faced in its implementation and prevent real structural changes in these organisations. Every GEP should be understood as a process that is born out of the will to grow and become stronger so that equality between women and men can be promoted and legitimised. One way to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of a GEP is to collect and incorporate the expertise, knowledge and experience of previous projects. For this reason, our project aims to implement 6 equality plans in 6 organizations (5 Universities and 1 Research Funding Organization) applying the criteria established and tested by GEAR-tools. The goal is to advance in the application and evaluation of equality measures in universities with the support of non-university entities that favor their promotion, impulse, evaluation and development. The GEPs will pursue the recognition and promotion of the research career of women, the incorporation of women in decision-making positions, and the promotion of a culture of equality in organizations.

The currently tabulated values are often of unknown quality, contradictory and devoid of essential information, such as Reynolds number and installation effect dependencies. The net result is that designers of ventilation systems for commercial, residential and industrial building, mines, etc. have to incorporate large factors of safety to ensure their systems work. This in turn leads to not only larger than necessary system components but, more importantly in the long term, higher running costs since the system may be operating under far from optimum conditions. A project has therefore been undertaken to produce new traceable mechanical energy loss data for ducting components.   RESULTS   A procedure for the determination of energy loss coefficients was developed and tested via an intercomparison involving 4 laboratories. For values in the range 0.31 to 0.72 the laboratories agreed to within one standard deviation of 2 to 7%. Further improvements were then made to the procedure and the energy loss coefficients for the entire range of circular ducts configurations used by industry were determined for normal span flow rates (Reynolds numbers) encountered in practice.

The elucidation of protein structures, localization, post-translation modifications, and protein-macromolecule interactions are important to establish their role in the biology of the cell. To establish their role and investigate the protein functions requires the integration of various complementary disciplines. Among all disciplines, chemistry is central in establishing new effective ways to manipulate a biological entity to understand cellular processes with molecular precision. For studying, analyzing and manipulating a macromolecule, the site-specific incorporation of reporter molecules, by virtue of ligation reactions, is a key factor.

679,30474,No,Kiosk-based Integrated Multimedia Service Access for Citizens,"Public users of 'ordinary' everyday computer and telecommunication services are overwhelmed in two significant ways: - the selection of the most appropriate service, given their particular needs at a point in time and - having selected a service, the difficulty of operation (use) of that service. KIMSAC addresses these problems by asserting the need for some form of mediation between users and services. This mediation is conceptualised by KIMSAC in terms of Personal Service Assistant (PSA). A PSA operates on behalf of a user in an analogous manner to a human personal secretary. KIMSAC involves the trial of multimedia kiosks (advanced public phone boxes) in three different locations in Ireland during 1997 and 1998. The kiosks provide access to networked multimedia applications that enable users to query social-welfare entitlements or transactions and also enable unemployed users to match their multimedia CVs to job vacancies. Every client will be assisted by an 'intelligent agent', a software program that searches, sorts, and filters information, based on the clients current needs. KIMSAC proposes the Personal Service Assistant (PSA) as a new form of mediation between users and services. A PSA operates as an agent and acts on behalf of the user in an attempt to address the user's needs. The PSA enables new modes of interaction between users and services. The project is also specifying new kinds of multimedia interfaces supporting the concept of a PSA. Components identified in the specifications are being prototyped and validated in the context of real end-user trials. In addition the platform required for supporting distributed multimedia services is being prototyped. The KIMSAC application contexts are those of social welfare services and job facilitation. The KIMSAC trials will lead the way towards a) shorter times-scales for employment consideration and b) shorter time-scales for welfare entitlement identification and registration. Through project WWW pages and press-releases surrounding the trails, greater awareness of the usability issues and technologies addressed by KIMSAC will be generated. Contributions to guidelines for usability of IBC applications will be made, in particular input relating to the incorporation of intelligent assistance. In addition, results assessing the usability benefits gained by various technologies and intelligent agents will be attained. Finally, usability contributions regarding the incorporation of interactive IBC services in public service kiosk can be derived. Expected Impact  KIMSAC will develop and adapt a related notion to that of a PSA, namely that of a personal 'software' assistant. KIMSAC will employ concepts and technologies to enable simpler and more intuitive means for users to access and use multimedia based services. Making services easier to use has many obvious benefits such as, increased uptake of new services, increased use of advanced features and increased frequency of use, all of which lead to increased satisfaction (and/or productivity) within the end-user community. Furthermore, user-friendly interfaces have the 'knock-on' benefit of reducing costs associated with user education and service support.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Guidelines for the development of distributed systems, the integration of multimedia and multi-agent systems and the implementation of a personal service assistant.  Kiosk based trials addressed social welfare services and job facilitation. Contribution to the programme Contributions were provided to enterprise and brokerage models and to the first agent standards of FIPA.  Technical Approach  In order to bring the vision of a PSA a step closer, KIMSAC seeks to integrate interface and multimedia technology from the IT industry with distributed platform technology from the telecommunications community. Newly emerging intelligent agent technology provides a vehicle for this integration. Agents act on behalf of a user in an attempt to address the user's needs. In the context of a telecommunications system, they enable new modes of interaction between users and services, e.g. agents can behave both proactively and reactively. KIMSAC takes a dual approach to usability by: - introducing new modes of interaction between users and services and - providing appropriate interfaces to enable users to take advantage of these new facilities. This project has an overall technical objective; to specify new kinds of multimedia interfaces supporting intelligent agent-user interactions i.e. providing an open service environment. Summary of Trial  KIMSAC's first trial is being operated in three separate geographic locations in Ireland during 1997; Dublin, Galway (West of Ireland) and Letterkenny (North West of Ireland) have been selected as the three locations. Screen shots from KIMSAC's first trail are shown below. Since KIMSAC is largely a human factors project, a trial with end users is all-important to validate the interface and application system design. The trial is being conducted in two parts. Whereas part 1 (1997) provides information on user behaviour and difficulties in usability, part 2 (1998) of the trial is concerned with the assessment and testing of the 'intelligent' personal service assistant itself. Part 2 of the trial will evaluate the robustness of the underlying technological supports in a live (kiosk-based) environment. The practicality from a service provider's perspective of providing information to the citizen and capturing data with intelligent assistance will be assessed. In addition, usability issues of supporting (interactive) IBC services such as video-conferencing are being assessed in the context of assisting the users to attain their objective. Key Issues  - The realisation and presentation of the Personal Service Assistant (PSA) metaphor such that usability is significantly increased. To be able to let ones personal assistant look for suitable jobs is very valuable; it can quickly inspect large numbers of offerings to find those that fit the user. - When the user swipes the personal identity card, his/her personal agent is activated, and stored client data is fetched. The user may choose to remain anonymous, and in this case the system will use the data as entered by the client in the session. - The mechanisms that enable the perception that there is an intelligent entity acting on behalf of the user. Intelligent agents use knowledge about the client to retrieve and process information in a client-specific way. The agents are goal-driven, which relieves the client from having to control the way the session proceeds. - The structure, navigation and exchange of service knowledge and information. Domain-specific rules reside in components clearly separated from the rest of the system, which simplifies maintenance. - The possible exploitation of emerging multimedia technology to enable PSA capabilities. - The adaptation and integration of agent and Internet technologies to support the operation of a PSA.",0,0
81,57324,No,Analysing public accountability procedures in contemporary european contexts,"The aim of this proposal is to analyse the relevance of public accountability procedures as tools for achieving publicly legitimate and socially sustainable policies and decisions. This will be done through empirical research and comparative analysis, in relation to seven national, and three socio-technological contexts. The background of this project is the lack of existing in-depth knowledge of the role of public accountability in contemporary, socially complex European policy- and decision-making and public debates. The project will thus specially contribute to the discussion of the structural changes arising from the ongoing European integration and enlargement process. The project will result in: country-related profiles; issue-specific case studies ; and an integrating comparative view of public accountability procedures in a European context. The results will be disseminated through national and trans-national seminars.",0,0
917,193216,No,Researcher's Night: meeting science and your next door scientist,"A diverse team of experts in scientific research and science communication from leading Research Institutes and Educational Organizations located in the Athens Metropolitan area is formed to organize the Researcher's Night activities for the years 2014 and 2015. By adopting the concept “Science invites People”, we propose a large scale REN, in 2014, at NCSR Demokritos, the largest Science Research campus in Attica, and a similar event in 2015, at IME a multiplex where science meets entertainment and exploration, organized by the National Observatory of Athens .  Based on past experience, we plan activities for an expected attendance of several thousand visitors. Our proposal involves activities from several scientific domains exemplifying in many cases the benefits of Interdisciplinarity. The activities will include the organization of pre-events, as part of the awareness campaign, as well as parallel events at three regions throughout Greece including Rodos, Corinth and Pylos, where parτicipating Institutions have satellite installations, so as to maximize impact and reach. Researcher's Night 2015 events will be linked with another major Researcher's Night event planned to take place in Rome, through the support of the local establishment of the European Space Agency (ESA).  The purpose of the project is to convey to the general public the ideas that Research is a necessary ingredient for progress, the Researchers are an integral part of the community and their profession is both fun, challenging, interesting and worth pursuing. The presentation of the work of the scientists to the Greek public will showcase the need of scientific and technological breakthroughs leading to inventions and opportunities that benefit society in many ways.   .",0,0
861,83384,No,Reconciling the Promotion of Equality with the Protection of Personal Data,"The project aims to explore the tension between the promotion of equality and the protection of personal data. In order to effectively combat discrimination against certain vulnerable groups, States need to be able to identify and measure the type and level of discrimination experienced by the groups concerned. To this end, they need to dispose of reliable data, broken down by criteria such as race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Yet, this information is 'sensitive data', the treatment of which is restricted by international and European norms on personal data protection. Through a comparative study of the legislation and practice adopted by a sample of countries (the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United States) in the field of anti-discrimination, the research will seek to define ways of reconciling the conflicting imperatives of the struggle against discrimination and personal data protection.",0,0
115,215870,No,Disruptive IoT solution for optimising the animal feed supply chain,"Animal feed is produced by feed suppliers in feed mills, and distributed in bulk to different animal farms, where it is stored in silos. Feed has to be produced ad-hoc for each farmer, and delivered in 24-48h. Each feed supplier is the provider for several silos from several farms (the top 50 EU feed suppliers manage on average 7,500 silos each). They receive daily hundreds of refilling orders whose logistics have to be optimized in a short time. However, the lack of reliable and cost-effective solutions to remotely monitor the silo’s feed stock hinders the optimization: most farmers assess it manually, provoking (i) inaccurate measures (trucks over or under loaded) and (ii) uncertainty on the demand (feed suppliers cannot organize production cycles or the raw materials purchase based on a cost-effectiveness criteria). As a result, there is yearly losses of 500€ per silo (equivalent to 400M€ in the EU28). INSYLO turns the situation around and provides the sector with an accurate and cost-effective solution to monitor remotely the silos’ feed stock levels, forecast the feed demand and allow feed suppliers to optimize inventories, production batches, delivery routes and raw materials purchases. INSYLO is a smart service that combines hardware and software. Through our unique smart volumetric sensor, we obtain an accurate measure of the silos' feedstock levels at a very low cost (6.5 cheaper than competitors). Our IoT device can be installed in only 5 minutes and it is fully independent of the farm’s resources (off-grid, solar energy, own Internet connectivity). Furthermore, it is connected to our smart platform on the cloud, which leverages the power of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to collect data from hundreds of thousands of silos and decide the right moment and quantity to restock each silo, optimising the whole feed supply chain. We will sell in the first five years more than 100,000 devices, capturing a market share of 2.13% of the 5M silos worldwide.",0,0
857,5335,No,Economic and environmental impact of the CSF : Modelling growth and development in the EC periphery,"To contribute to improved assessment of the economic and environmental impact of national and EC policies implemented for promoting growth in peripheral EC countries, through the use of a common economic model.  Possible outcomes of policy decisions in peripheral countries will be identified. It will also be possible to assess how they differ from each other and how they differ from outcomes in central EC economies.  1.Design of a common modelling framework entitled HERMIN :   The Irish and Spanish models will be proposed to the other peripheral countries' contractors.   National models will be designed, distinguishing at least three production sectors: industry, services and agriculture; they will include elements of the original HERMES model.  2.Construction, testing and comparison of national models :   This will be implemented in the four participating countries. All models will pass through a strict testing procedure.  3.Use of the model framework for review of CSF 1989-93 :   Data will be collected on micro-economic benefits of infra- structural, human capital, environmental, competitiveness and r&d policies in each country. Macro-economic consequences for peripheral countries will be derived from aggregation of these data. The impacts of the CSF 1989-93 in individual peripheral economies will then be derived from a series of model simulations.  4.Use of the models for assessment of Delors II CSF proposals : The common framework model will be used for making preliminary evaluation of the DELORS II proposal.  5.Energy/environment/human capital/technical progress issues : Analysis of elements associated with long term developments such as energy-environment-growth interactions, geographical relocation of production sites in the EC, R&D-growth- productivity interactions,... will be undertaken.  6.The four models will be operated in conjunction with a world model, NICEM, developed by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (London).",0,0
1009,75995,No,Mmpa,"The classical model of the macro-economy is based on the assumptions of continuous market clearing, perfect information and perfect competition. In the last thirty years this classical paradigm has been revived in models incorporating rationality in expectation-formation. At the same time this paradigm has been found by many researchers to be at odds with reality - various forms of rigidities and frictions change the dynamics of key macroeconomic variables and affect the equilibrium allocation of resources in a non-trivial way.   The increasing importance of rigidities and frictions in building plausible models of the economy and in policy design has led many economists to study carefully the theoretical underpinnings of friction-based models and to include various forms of rigidities in their theoretical analysis. The proposed conferences focus on the interaction of financial frictions and rigidities in macroeconomic models and their impact on policy making. There are many questions that deserve closer investigation and we hope that having a high-profile series of conferences on these topics will contribute to the deepening of our understanding of the role of frictions and rigidities in the macro-economy.",0,0
598,56943,No,Water loop conditioning concept to improve papermaking competitiveness (WACOPAC),"Scientific objectives and approach:  The participants include two paper mills, five technology suppliers, a research institute and a university. The research organisations operate as a link between the mills and the technology suppliers. Due to dynamic papermaking conditions fresh water consumption is caused for a significant part by product changes and broke. The goal of the project is to investigate enhancement of sustainable management for stock (wood), energy (natural gas and green house effect) and fresh water for different product types by application of a product and process based water treatment concept. In this water conditioning concept end-of pipe is replaced by in-process treatment in the primary loop of the production process. This concept is defined for various products and feedstock and consists of 4 complementary technologies: Fibre selector / remover, Fixed-bed biology, membrane system including a monitoring and control system. In Task 1, the production systems in the participating mills will be examined, and the requirements regarding water system closure will be specified. Task 2 includes development of a dynamic monitoring and control system and to create insight in the dynamic behaviour of the papermaking process. The next phase - operability studies of the several water treatment technologies - is divided into three main tasks (Tasks 3-5). During task 6, the whole treatment concept will be tested on long-term behaviour conditions in the mill. Influences of the obtained water quality will be investigated on product quality and the papermaking production process. In task 7, the results of this project regarding re-design will be adjusted and optimised. This includes revised water balancing, followed by water pinch analysis to localise best economical and technical solutions for the participating mills. Included is an overall cost/benefit analysis for implementation of the concept. Project-, scientific- and exploitation management are standard tasks.  Problems to be solved:  As economic circumstances change and environmental legislation tightens, paper mills are forced to minimise energy, chemistry and water consumption and produce minimum emissions. Without sustainable management further reductions are impossible. As a consequence there is a need for conditioning the overall production system. In this concept a control system is included and process water is conditioned by a combination of environmental friendly treatment technologies in the primary water loop of the production process. The objective is to achieve reduction of freshwater (40%), energy (25%), wood(25%) and chemical(40%) consumption combined with an improvement in runnability, capacity and product quality. Overall profitability will increase with 10 EURO /ton of paper and decrease of off-spec production (50%). The technology suppliers would increase market share. Subsequently employability, working conditions, usage of natural resources and environmental effects will improve.  Expected Impacts:  Achievements are an in-mill tested water treatment concept, which is applicable for paper industry and other industries. Second: increase of knowledge about in-process treatment systems and control systems. Paper mills will implement results directly, technology suppliers will transfer results into their own network and RTD performer will support. In a co-operation technology suppliers will be able to offer complete systems. Obtained results will be compared with milestones and objectives.",0,0

614,101300,No,Optimizing Miscanthus Biomass Production - OPTIMISC,"Miscanthus is a C4 perennial rhizomatous grass that has become a leading candidate crop for production of lignocellulosic feedstocks due to its rapid biomass accumulation in temperate climates. There is currently a single commercial clone, M. x giganteus, which has a number of limitations. Research over the past 20 years has shown that a few key species and their interspecific hybrids have a high yield potential whilst requiring low inputs. The overall objective of this project is to optimize the miscanthus bioenergy and bioproduct chain by: trialling elite germplasm types over a range of sites across Europe, Ukraine and Russia; analysing the key traits that currently limit the potential of miscanthus; identifying high-value bioproducts; and modelling the combined results to provide recommendations to policy makers, growers and industry. The outcomes of the project will include screened germplasm and knowledge which will provide solutions to key existing bottlenecks. The specific topics tackled in the field and controlled environment trials are (1) dissection of the traits underpinning tolerance to the abiotic stresses drought, salinity, cold and freezing, (2) yield and quality in a wide range of environments, taking into consideration traits such as senescence, nutrient recycling and nutrient-use efficiency, (3) process-ability of biomass to convenient fuel formats and added-value products. Data gathered will be integrated through the development of modelling parameters needed to build up life-cycle analysis models and other decision support tools to identify optimum production scenarios in the EU, Ukraine and Russia. Recommendations will be provided to miscanthus developers on appropriate genotype selection, propagation and processing methods to maximize the environmental, economic and social benefits. The development of the full potential of miscanthus through OPTIMISC will contribute to Europe’s transition to a sustainable biobased economy.",0,0
253,51942,No,New means to promote pedestrian traffic in cities,"Problems to be solved Problems related to traffic, congestion, parking, traffic safety, noise and pollution, and to physical, functional and qualitative decay of our urban environment in general, are today particularly acute in European cities. Since the 1950's the trend has been in all European cities to become more and more car-oriented. Car traffic increasingly occupies public spaces of the cities and causes pollution, noise and casualties. This has happened despite many efforts to regulate it in cities. At the same time the share of the non-motorised transport modes is declining all over Europe, although bicycling in some European cities plays an important role. Several European policies bring forward the problems concerning quality of life, equality, parity of access to basic services, social inclusion, regeneration of urban areas, sustainability of the urban environment, pollution, and condition of buildings, public spaces, cultural heritage and the balance of the urban system. The increase of the use of cars in our cities is one significant cause for all these problems. A revival of walking in cities would be a simple and natural way to remedy many of the above-mentioned problems. It would reduce the use of cars and enhance the use of public transport and thus decrease the pollution load. It would also promote the social life in the public spaces and improve the parity of citizens. The promotion of walking would also have many other positive consequences by, for example, improving citizens' physical condition and opening again their eyes to the details and richness of the surrounding nature and physical milieu. However, the problem remains how to effectively promote city walking. Scientific objectives and approach The main goal of PROMPT is to promote walking in cities. Its concrete objective is to develop for that purpose new innovative tools and generic solutions for city actors involved in urban planning and design as well as decision-making. The approach of the project is to consider all the causes enhancing or hindering walking in parallel. The scope ranges from the overall urban structure to the detailed street level. The tools and solutions are aimed at problem identification, design and planning as well as implementation of the considered measures in different local or European wide situations. The project is based on the analysis of certain existing towns in the participating countries and of some relevant case areas in them. The analysis is made according to six different themes: 1) safety, 2) accessibility, 3) comfort, 4) attractiveness, 5) intermodality and 6) implementation. Although one can promote walking by considering each of these issues one by one, it is crucial to consider how they work together: the whole is not the sum of its parts. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is utilised to find good comprehensive solutions for the identified problems. Different user categories, climatic conditions, different situations in the urban structure and cultural values of the site are also taken into account in the analysis. Expected impacts The planners', designers' and decision makers' knowledge about how to promote walking in practice is being considerably improved through the establishment of new tools and solutions and their effective dissemination during and after the project. This, in turn, is expected to increase the share of walking in the future transport bringing along the benefits stated above. The main benefits will be the decrease of harmful impacts on the environment as well as the improvement of the accessibility to the public spaces, the health of the citizens, and their equality regardless of car ownership, health or disability. The increase of walking means also reductions in vehicle and road investments. Further, it means less costs in pollution abatements, less accidents and injuries and less damages in buildings. The impacts are difficult to quantify beforehand, but the project aims also at making some more concrete estimations of them. The main beneficiaries are the citizens themselves as well as the city authorities in many ways.",0,0

The project CITT triggers challenges in the ICT sector by providing a strategy to improve technology transfer between the business and research communities within the Centrope region in order to support its growth.   The project’s backgrounds are several key elements in the area of research driven sectors which weaken a knowledge driven economy:   1) Lack of relevant information and awareness on the side of policy makers especially on a regional level and therefore limited commitment and/or engagement to implement new policy tools.   2)  Centralised system which often do not reflect regional specification.    3)  Barriers in the interaction between business and academia.    In order to overcome national, institutional and mental problems linked to technology transfer in the area of digital technologies, it is the aim of the project to demonstrate their viability in best practice examples and offering a strategy within defined regional limits which should, however, be able to be up scaled to the benefit of the entire Union.    Simultaneously, the project will identify relevant players in ICT industry and R&D which so far have not been categorised in this way. A database containing such information will represent a unique resource valuable to (Central) Europe’s economy.  The project partners will provide solutions for improved technology transfer between the research and business communities as well as for mentoring and coaching of the research and business communities (based on mutual approach). Thus, the project tries to overcome increased competition for the same resources in the globalised economy.   Experience in the Centrope region has shown that cross-border cooperation provides an ideal impulse for further development of the area and for further strengthening of its position in a global market. Creating of a strategy for a cross-border ICT network will provide support for a dynamic development of the region as the national borders are loosing their significance.",0,0
970,74914,No,Integration of animal welfare in the food quality chain: from public concern to improved welfare and transparent quality,"The primary objective of the 'Food Quality and Safety' Priority is to improve the health and well-being of European citizens through ensuring a higher quality of food. In a 'fork to farm' approach it recognises that consumer perception of food quality is n ot only determined by overall nature and safety but also by the welfare status of the animal from which it was produced. Thus, animal welfare is part of an overall 'food quality concept'.Within WELFARE QUALITY, leading European groups with the most appropr iate specialist expertise are integrated to build on European research strengths and to realise important societal and policy objectives in this Priority Area. Our research program is designed to develop pan-European standards for on-farm welfare assessmen t and product information systems as well as practical strategies for improving animal welfare. - Considerable effort is focused on analysing and addressing perceptions and concerns of principal stakeholders and providing appropriate feedback. Educational and media initiatives, web-based platforms etc will further enhance societal involvement. - Transparency of the product quality chain requires visibility of production processes and an understanding of how they affect welfare; the key is to link husbandry practices to informed animal product consumption. This demands reliable on-farm welfare monitoring systems enabling assessment of welfare status and the standardised conversion of welfare measures into accessible and understandable information, thereby add ressing concerns and allowing clear marketing and profiling of products. - Development of innovative, species-specific, practical strategies for improving animal welfare will minimise the occurrence of harmful behavioural and physiological states, improve human-animal relationships, and provide animals with safe and stimulating environments. - Finally, implementation and dissemination of the newly developed welfare monitoring and product information #'",0,0
373,107361,No,"Universal Banking, Corporate Control and Crises","Financial intermediaries play a vital role in providing capital to corporations. The 2007-2009 financial crisis had dramatic consequences on the organization of the financial system that led to the rise of universal banking and financial conglomerates. Financial conglomerates have been common in Europe, but the recent developments have eroded the separation of commercial and investment banking elsewhere. Financial conglomerates act as lenders but also underwrite and trade securities, have equity stakes and sit on the board of corporations, and manage mutual and pension funds that invest in corporations. These forms of corporate control by financial conglomerates are distinct in their incentives and costs and therefore can have distinct effects on non-financial corporations. We will study the effect of control by financial conglomerates on corporation’s performance, investment, financing, and corporate governance policies. A particular relevant channel through which financial conglomerates can affect firm’s policies is the credit channel. Firms establish relationships with financial conglomerates that give easier access to credit and potentially at a lower cost due to economies of scale in information collection and monitoring. There may be, however, costs to firms with a close relationship with a financial conglomerate as firms may be locked up due to an information monopoly. We will study the effects of bank-firm relationships on the loan market. In particular, we will examine the importance of these relationships for explaining differences in the cost of bank distress across firms. The hypothesis is that strong ties with banks reduce firms’ ability to substitute relationship bank loans with other sources of external finance, and therefore firms with stronger relationships could experience greater costs during financial crises. We will contribute to the understanding the consequences of shocks to the financial health of banks for nonfinancial firms.",0,0
225,57474,No,European Programme for an Ontology-based Working Environment for Regulations and legislation,"Many enterprises and citizens have difficulties in dealing with the ever-growing magnitude and complexity of (inter-) national rules and regulations. The business solution that will be developed in the E-POWER project will result in components designed for solving knowledge exchange between governments, citizens and enterprises. The proposed solutions will improve the quality and knowledge of regulations, improve the access of public information, decrease the 'time to market' for implementing new regulations, and aid in harmonisation of laws and regulations within the Community  Objectives: E-POWER will implement a knowledge management solution by providing a method and tools that help to improve the quality of legislation whilst facilitating the enforcement of law. Both method and tools will decrease the time to market for new/changed legislation and facilitate the maintenance of legislation and improving the access to the governmental body of knowledge by offering new E-services. Furthermore the use of this method and tools will result in a more efficient us of scarce knowledge resources. The E-POWER project will result in transparency of pension arrangements for the (future) elderly citizens. The project will offer tools that help with the harmonisation of pension regulations. By providing easy access (using the Internet) to vital information the project will contribute to the social inclusion of citizens. E-POWER will consequently improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public administrations and contribute to the completion of the internal market.  Work description: The core of the E-POWER project is the method for translating legislation into executable (formal) specifications. Tools will be developed to do most of the translation of legislation automatically. Therefore translation patterns are applied and reused whenever possible. Thus the method ensures the achievement of the objectives such as reducing the time to market. The POWER-method will be used to develop decision support and information systems (DSSs) for pension regulations of two different EC countries. The development of these systems is carried out under the responsibilities of end-users in both countries, one public administration and one major financial and insurance company. Development and testing the formal descriptions (of the legal domain) and DSSs is supported by modelling and verification tools. General versions of these tools are input for the project, but they will be adapted in the first project phase to handle and produce E-POWER formal descriptions. In the second phase, the functionality of the tools will be expanded. These tools will be developed as separate deliverables and integrated in the E-POWER Suite. During the entire project, development will be guided by end-user evaluation (also by those in the User Platform to be established in the first project-phase). The composition of the consortium presents a balance between commercial and governmental parties, tool suppliers and end users. By working on pension regulations from different countries we will be able to highlight obstacles that hinder the harmonisation of pension regulations.  Milestones: The E-POWER project will have three different results. The first milestone will be the availability of the models of the pension regulations and processes of two EC-countries. From these models we will develop Decision and Information Support Systems available to the European citizens (third milestone). These DSS's will be developed among others with the refined modelling and modified verification tools that also result from E-POWER (second milestone). The various tools will be integrated in the E-POWER Suite (fourth milestone). The dissemination of these results will be described in the deployment plan.",0,0
480,195740,No,SpeecH and Auditory Processing: Effects of Development,"Learning a language involves recognizing the acoustic properties of speech sounds that have a functional role. The abilities of perceiving and processing speech sounds are first constrained by basic hearing abilities. The auditory system extracts and processes the acoustic properties from the input language and thus, fully contributes to the development of phonetic categories. Surprisingly, information concerning the interaction between basic auditory capacities and early development of speech processing is still lacking. The present project seeks to combine two approaches to explore this interaction: developmental psycholinguistics, studying the acquisition of a language, and psychoacoustics, describing the auditory mechanisms linked to the perception of speech sounds. First, this project aims to investigate when and how auditory and speech processes interact. The perception of the speech acoustic information (such as spectro-temporal modulations described by psychoacoustic studies) will be assess in adults and infants from different language environments. Second, this project aims to explore further this interaction by investigating the effect of impaired auditory processes on speech perception development. The perception of speech acoustic information will be assessed in hearing-impaired children having access to the hearing world through hearing aids. This research project highlights an innovative multidisciplinary perspective within the speech perception development field. This project will have significant impacts on 1) general health (i.e., auditory rehabilitation for hearing-impaired children) and 2) language education (i.e., perception of foreign languages during development).",0,0
706,91052,No,Models and their Effects on Development paths: an Ethnographic and comparative Approach to knowledge transmission and livelilhood strategies,"The project interrogates the impact of development paths on the livelihoods and life projects of citizens. Starting from the premise that the analysis of (dominant or alternative) development paths must be situated within the complexities of historically unfolding links and realtionships, we shall explore how they are 'practiced' in specific environments. Central questions address: 1) How development models interact with specific socio-economic contexts 2) The effects of these interactions on transmissions and innovation of knowledge/skills 3) How specific development paths affect livelihood strategies.  An interdisciplinary approach combines qualitative research and comparative methodologies with modelling to explore the dynamic effects of development models as they are implemented in specific contexts, at micro and macro levels. We hypothesise that: a) There is a lack of fit between the formal design of development models and their concrete applications. b) The transmission of knowledge/skills is central to effective development. c) Knowledge/skills (both tacit and explicit) are transmitted through formal and informal mechanisms, for example between gender and generations in families and neighbourhoods. d) Political and economic disruptions constitute situations of crisis in this transmission but at the same time afford opportunities for innovation.  Focusing on connections between skills, work and unemployment in relation to heavy industry, the research will identify critical points in the shifts in demand for knowledge across generations, regions and economic spheres. An ethnographic approach enables a detailed account of social networks (encompassing those of solidarity and support) within and beyond work places, including strategic friendship, kinship and neighbourhood relations. The project will thus contribute to the comparative analysis of development models, and will generate recommendations for more complex and context-sensitive approaches.",1,0

For known hypothalamic neuron subtypes, their ability to undergo stimulus-dependent expressional switches challenge their neurotransmitter- and neuropeptide-based classifications. These gaps of knowledge limit conceptual advances on neuronal loci, dynamic synapse recruitment and network hierarchy for metabolic control, and the molecular origins of disease. We have established the single cell transcriptome landscape of the paraventricular nucleus including its magno- and parvocellular domains. We will use this template to reveal novel cell identities and cell-state switches upon acute stress. We describe >25 neuronal subtypes under stress-free conditions, surpassing the resolution of any prior approach. Thus, we will resolve neurotransmitter-neuropeptide relationships at the single neuron level, with a focus on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), determine biophysical parameters of CRH co-release with a fast neurotransmitter, and decipher changes to afferent organization upon stress. A novel parvocellular subclass constitutively expresses secretagogin, a calcium-sensor, which is indispensable for CRH release. We will link secretagogin loss-of-function in CRH neurons to Addison’s disease (chronic adrenal insufficiency associated with insulin resistance). Moreover, we propose a (pro-)hormone-like role for secretagogin released from CRH neurons into the circulation. Overall, our work program will produce new understanding on cellular diversity and organizational rules in the hypothalamus.",0,0
6,223827,Yes,Resilience and Resignation among Transnational Roma and non-Roma Youths,"Current European policy frameworks seek to foster societal development and individual advancement by getting more people educated, and for longer. At the same time, official programs encourage “learning mobility” as a way to support educational and professional opportunities. Yet, the adversities that underprivileged youths “on the move” are faced with as they strive to comply with these prescriptions clearly reveal the practical limitations of such powerful narrative construction: the issue of whether spatial mobility constitutes an asset or not for young people remains largely unexplored. Building on this, RETRY aims to develop a sophisticated understanding of the drivers of educational and post-educational marginality and inclusion in contemporary Europe. At this scope, it provides a theoretically informed, in-depth ethnographic, multi-sited and collaborative account of a phenomenon that has remains largely understudied so far: the movements into adulthood of underprivileged Roma and non-Roma European youths “affected by mobility”. The overall question of whether, and under what conditions, their trajectories disclose broader processes of social transformation or reproduce structural inequalities is addressed through the elaboration of a spatial and relational theory of resilience and resignation in youth. The theory aims to unveil the complex interplay of structural constraints and individual agency that shapes the multiple interactions between spatial, social, and biographical mobility. At this scope, RETRY addresses specific questions vis-à-vis the impact of welfare policies, community strategies, and personal ties on the transitions of young people striving to navigate towards their desirable futures in a changing and unstable environment.",0,1
592,194574,No,Financial and Institutional Reforms for the Entrepreneurial Society,"In this project we will analyse the broader contexts of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth in Europe to support implementation of the Commission’s 'Europe 2020' growth strategy and to restore Europe’s ability to innovate, grow and create jobs over the coming decades. In this proposal we argue that entrepreneurship must play a central role in that effort. 'Entrepreneurship' tends to make people think of the US and its model of high growth and high-tech start-ups in Silicon Valley. We are keenly aware, however, that a European growth agenda requires a focus on European entrepreneurship. US recipes and models will not fit the European context and do not deliver the results Europe wants. Our project's objective is therefore to thoroughly analyse European institutional arrangements and their current (in)ability to mobilise Europe’s human, financial and knowledge resources for entrepreneurial activity. This will help us formulate an effective reform strategy to reinvigorate European economies. The current diversity of institutional arrangements in Europe has long and common historical roots that must first be recognised and understood. Based on common global trends in technology and competition, we then establish the urgency and desirability for making the transition to a more entrepreneurial economy throughout Europe.  Once this has been established, our project will develop and provide the tools for policy makers to assess the quality of national and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems and to identify the main strengths and weaknesses with regard to making the transition. Based on this assessment we will formulate specific proposals to enhance the allocation of talent, finance and knowledge to new value creation and we will conclude our project with a legal analysis to see where competencies currently lie and what action could be taken.",0,0
553,219521,No,Population dynamics and cultural adaptations of the last Neandertals and first Modern humans in inland Iberia: a multi-proxy investigation,"The relations between cultural developments and environmental change among hunter-gatherers are crucial for studying population dynamics during the last glaciation (110,000–11,700 years ago). However, proposing solid interpretations on how climate and environment variability affected the social and techno-economic organisation of hominins, requires robust geoarchaeological, chronological, and palaeoecological evidence. In the Iberian Peninsula, a key area for this period due to its geographic position and ecological variability, models on these topics are biased by the poor quality of available evidence for its interior lands. The Iberian interior has been traditionally depicted as a marginal and few populated region due to its harsh ecological conditions compared to the coastal areas. Based on preliminary data suggesting that this picture could be wrong, I hypothesize (1) that the human settlement of interior Iberia during this period was more stable than previously thought and (2) that his has relevant implications at the European scale for problems such as the replacement of Neandertals by modern humans, the first modern human peopling of Europe, and the patterns of land use and mobility during the coldest stages of the last glacial. To test these hypotheses, this project will investigate population dynamics and human-environment interactions of the last Neandertals and first modern humans in interior Iberia based on completely unprecedented evidence gathered by means of a macro-regional and interdisciplinary research project. This involves the participation of a wide team of scholars coordinated by the PI, and a network of methods including field surveys, geoarchaeological excavations and chronometric, paleoecological, zooarchaeological, techno-economic and symbolic studies. The results will significantly change our views on key biocultural and ecological processes of the European prehistory, and the way human societies have dealt with challenging environments.",0,0

The science behind these phenomena is complex and advancement in knowledge proceeds with progress in data acquisition and forecasting useful for real-scenario interventions. The employment of nature-based solutions (NBS) to mitigate the impact of hydro-meteorological phenomena is not adequately demonstrated, still uncoordinated at the European level, therefore not reaching full potential. Actions to achieve highest NBS impact requires strategies to enhance societal acceptance, policy strengthening while demonstrating advantages for market development.  The objective of OPERANDUM is to reduce hydro-meteorological risks in European territories through co-designed, co-developed, deployed, tested and demonstrated innovative green and blue/grey/hybrid NBS, and push business exploitation. It aims provision of science-evidence for the usability of NBS, best practices for their design based on participatory processes. It foresees a multiple level of stakeholders engagement from the local community up to the international level to leverage widest possible NBS acceptance to promote its diffusion as a good practice.   It establishes the framework for the strengthening of NBS-based policies according to local legislation and promotes technology and innovation in NBS to create a European leadership.  OPERANDUM is based on open-air laboratories (OALs), a fairly new concept that expands the Living Labs to a wider vision for natural and rural areas. In OALs novel NBS in seven European countries and three in China and Australia are implemented to address specific risks and their effectiveness, assessed through innovative monitoring systems and cutting-edge numerical modelling approaches. OPERANDUM realizes a multi-dimensional open and flexible platform enabling stakeholders and end users to improve knowledge in NBS to mitigate climate change as well as ways to promote and exploit the improved/preserved environment while increasing business opportunities.",0,0
407,208611,No,Social Vulnerability and its Intersections: The role of gender in a comparative perspective,"VINE seeks to disentangle the multidimensionality of the risk of social exclusion, focusing on vulnerable populations; specifically, those individuals who are in a fragile condition with regard to integration into the domains of well-being (family, labour market, welfare state). Using EU-SILC microdata, the project analyses the interactions between social vulnerability and different individual characteristics that might magnify it. Secondly, the project intends to study how, and in what ways, these individual characteristics combine to determine economic insecurity at household level. The main contribution of this project is proposing an analysis of how the institutional context as well as individual characteristics affects individual risk of living in vulnerable households, from a comparative and multidimensional perspective. By comparing six European countries, as representatives of different institutional environments, the VINE project aims to deliver a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms that determine both men and women’s exposure to social vulnerability. The innovation herein is the assumption that gender is the main analytical dimension in interactions, when theorised according to the intersectional perspective. With a multi-dimensional explorative analysis, and multinomial logistic regression, the analysis will lead to the development of a synthetic indicator of economic insecurity at the household level, permitting assessment of its interactions with specific individual vulnerability profiles. The final aim is to disentangle factors informing individual’s exposure to different degrees of social vulnerability, analysing their consequences and household’s economic insecurity, and possible influences from the institutional context. Thanks to this project, the ER will fill her gap in quantitative research analysis and she will be able to empower her professional profile compete for tenure-track position in the international academic labour market.",1,0
40,207875,Yes,The Design of Social Policy in a Heterogeneous World,"Modern societies are characterized by tremendous heterogeneity in economic outcomes: from heterogeneity in wages and employment, to heterogeneity in capital income, wealth and health outcomes. It is unclear, however, how to map heterogeneity in these outcomes to heterogeneity in welfare. This mapping is crucial for the design of tax and benefit systems, providing insurance against individual risk and redistributing income between individuals, while maintaining proper incentives.  The main objectives of HETEROPOLIS are: 1) to provide new insights on the relation between inequality in earnings, wealth and consumption, 2) to develop a new consumption-based method to measure welfare inequality and heterogeneity in the marginal value of social transfers, 3) to provide and implement a simple, but general evidence-based framework to evaluate the differential design of social insurance based on observable heterogeneity, 4) to analyse selection effects due to unobservable heterogeneity and how they affect social insurance design, 5) to analyse heterogeneity in behavioural “biases” and their consequences for policy design.  The first part of HETEROPOLIS analyses the use of registry-based consumption measures to evaluate heterogeneity in welfare and exploits a newly developed data set based on administrative registers for the universe of Swedish households providing comprehensive and detailed information on income, wealth, labour market outcomes and other variables. The second part develops and implements a general evidence-based framework to evaluate the design of multi-faceted social insurance programs in a heterogeneous world. The final part of HETEROPOLIS analyses and estimates different sources of heterogeneity that affect market efficiency and justify further government interventions.",1,1

These universities have undertaken joint research, published, and jointly created a European Doctoral Enhancement Programme on Peace and Conflict Studies. The aim is to provide high quality training and research on sustainable peace building, implying a good understanding of the cross-impacts of the necessary and interdependent peace building activities, especially the promotion of good governance, inclusive development and comprehensive security. The study is comprehensive and trans-disciplinary; it sees peace building as a complex dynamic process of change involving different sectors, levels and actors, and researches the interdependencies or cross-impacts between the diplomatic, political, economic, security, and humanitarian efforts made in post-conflict situations. Each of the 11 participants will belong to one or more of three research programme teams –good governance, comprehensive security and inclusive development. Researchers, upon choosing their research tracks, will be closely connected to one of the three teams and receive close professional and academic supervision. This project is based on the idea of &quot;participative governance&quot;, which reconciles social values with those of a market economy, defending the promotion of peace and economic and social development through the participation of all social agents and actors, including local communities, special interest groups and companies, the public sector and development agencies and the voluntary sector including arts and environmental organisations.

594,98929,No,Social Platform identifying Research and Policy needs for Sustainable Lifestyles,"The concept of sustainable lifestyles refers to patterns of behaviour shaped by personal and social interactions and conditioned by environmental and socio-economic contexts that aim at improving well-being and health of present and future generations. Sustainable lifestyles embrace economic, social, technical, cultural, legal and environmental aspects at individual, local, national, EU and international levels. Sustainable lifestyles are then related to social innovation, given the crucial importance of bottom up inputs and creativity to change behaviours. Sustainable lifestyles are a relatively new idea in the sustainable consumption and production domain and comprehensive research agenda and policy strategy for promoting it is missing in the EU. The SPREAD project aims to fill this gap by consolidating existing body of knowledge from research projects and experiences of stakeholder networks, comprising researchers, health and education experts, industry, services and civil society representatives. It aims to create scenarios of sustainable lifestyles in 2050 through a social platform, focusing on sustainable living, moving, consuming and healthy life and by setting up a peoples’ forum and an online platform in order to host an ongoing dialogue open to public. By using the back-casting approach a roadmap with a timeline on how to achieve sustainable lifestyles will be developed. To support European policy makers in their work on sustainable lifestyles the project will develop a research agenda for the future. The 24-month project is coordinated by the UNEP/Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP, Germany).

STEP, by focussing on countries with the highest incidences of energy poverty, will use existing channels to reach energy poor consumers. Synthesising experience and knowledge of consumer organisations on energy and consumer issues, strengthening partnerships with frontline organisations in daily contact with energy poor consumers, and consolidating best practices from past projects on energy poverty, the project will implement appropriate schemes to alleviate energy poverty in the 9 target countries (Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Portugal, Cyprus and the UK).  The general objective of STEP is to alleviate energy poverty by facilitating behavioural change through trusted, tailored advice provided directly to consumers in or at risk of energy poverty and by implementing low-cost energy efficiency solutions in energy poor households. The specific objectives are:   - to develop well-functioning and well-trained national networks of advisors from consumer and frontline organisations who are in direct contact with consumers in or at risk of energy poverty - to improve living conditions of consumers in or at risk of energy poverty through behaviour change and implementation of no- or low-cost energy efficiency measures - to create schemes contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty, promote their replication and draw policy recommendations  Through low cost energy efficiency measures - such as information campaigns and tips, demonstrations of cost savings, installation of no- and low-cost energy efficiency measures – STEP has the potential to reduce consumer energy bills and provide relief to energy poor households. Furthermore, through the institutionalisation of energy efficiency advice in sustainable consumer networks, we anticipate long term impacts and sustainability of STEP.",1,1
914,60511,No,School Experience in two European Multicultural Societies: A Comparative Study between Belgium and Britain,"Research objectives and content  This project aims to compare the school experience of adolescents from ethnic minorities' in different schools in Brussels and Birmingham. The way educational systems face social and cultural heterogeneity has become an important issue in Western European multicultural societies and poses the questions of their equity as well as their efficiency. The way British and Belgian educational systems deal with multiculturalism thoroughly differs, and the school experience within each context has not been thoroughly and comparatively analysed. To construct our theoretical framework we will use recent theories of ethnicity, sociology of education (educational strategies and school experience theories) and socialisation.  Our main research questions will be: .How can the strategies developed by both educational systems to deal with multiculturalism be characterized? .How do the school strategies affect adolescents' school experience? .How do the characteristics of the different ethnic groups observed influence adolescents' school experience?  After a brief review of both national and local contexts, the main fieldwork will be conducted in two similar multi-ethnic boroughs: one in Brussels and one in Birmingham.  This part will be dedicated to the comprehension of school experience, through individual interviews combined with the method of sociological intervention (Touraine, 1978, Dubet, 1995).  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  This project will provide two principal products: 1. A qualitative comparison of the way two European educational systems deal with multiculturalism; 2. A global and qualitative approach of school socialisation as a 'social experience', analysing the articulation between its different dimensions (norms integration, school career and self- construction).  The harmonisation of European educational systems requires the accumulation of comparative research.  This project will contribute to this task providing information out two important facets of the problem: efficient and democratic educational strategies with respect to social and cultural heterogeneity and the school experience of adolescents from ethnic minorities.

720,79041,No,Asymptotics of stochastic dynamical systems,"The proposed research will be concerned with applications of large deviations in areas of stochastic dynamical systems that exhibit discontinuities due to sudden changes in their parameters or due to the presence of heavy-tailed probability distributions. The goal is the understanding and analysis of the behaviour of these complex systems in time (focusing mostly in stability analysis) as well as in space (random graph models possessing nodes with a gigantic number of neighbours being a principal object of study). Besides analysis, the research will be concerned with applications to management and control via risk sensitive methods, i.e., to the design of stochastic systems. To this end, we will use methods available in other application areas for stochastic systems, such as financial markets.

208,101869,No,Onset of Star Formation: Connecting Theory and Observations,"Star formation is one of the most active areas of both theoretical astrophysics and observational astronomy. The formulation of a theory of star formation is essential not only for understanding the origin of our own solar system and, ultimately, of life itself, but also for the development of a theory of galaxy formation and evolution. We propose a comprehensive study of observational signatures of a variety of prestellar molecular cloud core models, aimed at probing the initial conditions of star formation and the origin of protostars. We will conduct this study in three steps. First, we will follow the dynamical evolution of molecular cloud cores using different models (such as pure hydrodynamical collapse; magnetically modulated collapse; and collapse with and without the effect of rotation). Second, we will couple these models to a network of chemical reactions that will self-consistently follow the relative abundances for ~100 molecular species, by solving the chemical reactions simultaneously with the dynamical equations. Third, we will couple these calculations to both continuum and line radiative transfer solvers, which will enable us to produce both maps and spectra of core models. Finally, the convolution of our results with the instrumental capabilities of different observatories (such as Herschel and SOFIA) will produce sets of mock observations, which will allow us to: (a) assess the potential of observations with different instruments to differentiate between models for the dynamics of prestellar cores; (b) propose specific observations with maximal scientific return in the discrimination between dynamical models; and (c) for existing observations, offer interpretation in terms of their consistency with each dynamical model examined.",0,0

The fellowship will be carried out at the University of California, Los Angeles for 24 months and at the University of Cyprus for 12 months. The research objectives of the proposed research are twofold: (1) Investigate the effect of social identity on preferences for redistribution and (2) Investigate the existence of multiple regimes and parameter heterogeneity on preferences for redistribution. To achieve Objective 1 the fellow will employ social interaction models using innovative parametric and nonparametric techniques allowing for endogeneity in order to capture the high-dimensionality of social identity, aiming to identify the social factors that determine preferences for redistribution and a broader range of socioeconomic attitudes and beliefs. To reach Objective 2 the fellow will use novel econometric methodologies such as threshold regression models that account for social factors and account for the endogeneity of the threshold variable, aiming  to identify a set of threshold variables that classify preferences for redistribution into various regimes based on individual, belief, and social heterogeneity. The fellowship will result in high quality research as well as targeted policy papers aimed at eliminating several negative social phenomena, impacting the academic community, the Cypriot and European policy makers and the general public.

Recent results demonstrate that quantum confinement in P(Black) thin layers leads to promising electronic properties such as an extremely high carrier mobility and tunable direct band gaps from visible to mid-infrared depending on the layer thickness. These properties have significant echoes in photonics and 2D transport physics. Studying pristine P(black) thin layers is however challenging due to the poor chemical and structural stability of elemental phosphorus. Indeed, the PI and his coworkers recently revealed a photo-activated charge transfer process involving adsorbed oxygen and water in ambient conditions that leads to a strong photo-oxidation of P(Black).  Our approach targets 1- the fabrication of nano-heterostructures based on P(Black) thin layers sandwiched and or intercalated with protective Boron Nitride (BN) insulator layers ; 2- the fundamental studies of this new type of material. The scientific program focuses on the band gap study of P(black) depending on the thickness by Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) and on electroluminescence of P(black) based heterostructures. The project represents a major leverage in the career trajectory of the PI by a fast, efficient and sustainable repatriation of this new field of research in the French and European landscape, in complete synergy with the momentum given by the EU member states on 2D related materials. Moreover this action offers, via a strong and customized training programm, a unique opportunity to the PI to acquire new and complementary skills in Boron Nitride thin layer synthesis and TEM, especially the TEM-Energy Electron Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) operating mode, that is particularly well adapted for 2D semiconductors in the hosting laboratory fully expert in these matters and with which the PI has already developed a strong link.",0,0

However, the existence of chronologies that are either too ambiguous, imprecise, poorly described, or only based on non-numeric dating methods, prevents the development of well sustained hypotheses on the age of such early expansions, on hominin migratory patterns, and on the driving mechanism behind such migrations. This interdisciplinary project entails the application of newly developed techniques and protocols in the field of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to obtain robust absolute chronologies on key Lower Palaeolithic archaeological sites in Western Europe. The main aim of the research is to improve and expand on the current chronological framework of important late Early Pleistocene (1.2 Ma - 780 ka) and Middle Pleistocene (780 ka - 125 ka) archaeological records in the Iberian Peninsula in order to accurately reconstruct and interpret the earliest human expansions into Europe. An integral aspect of this research is the pursuit of methodological advancements and refinements of the latest protocols in OSL dating to push back the existing age range of the technique. This project will focus on several important early human occupation sites in the Iberian Peninsula, namely the Atapuerca karstic complex in northern Spain, Orce sites (Fuente Nueva III and Barranco León), Guadix-Baza Basin, southeast Spain, and La Boella, south Barcelona, northeast Spain. This work will help to confidently reconstruct the emergence and expansion of human species in Western Europe, and improve interpretations of when and how past environmental changes have impacted human populations and their evolution.'",0,0
677,88196,No,Development of a two-approach plate system for the fast and simultaneous detection of MDR and XDR M. tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues being a leading cause of death due to a single infectious disease agent. The HIV/AIDS pandemic and the emergence of drug resistance are compounding factors that hinder the control of the disease. Associated with this problem is the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, defined as strains resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the most valuable drugs in the treatment of the disease. More recently, the appearance of extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains has been reported. These strains, in addition to being MDR, are also resistant to key second-line drugs. Patients, especially HIV patients, harbouring XDR strains have virtually no treatment options. New and improved methods for fast detection of drug resistance are urgently needed. This project will develop a twofold-approach system for the fast and simultaneous detection of MDR and XDR strains based on a rapid phenotypic assay and a genotypic test. Colorimetric methods, which have been previously validated by our group for first-line drug susceptibility testing, will be developed for key second-line drugs involved in XDRTB. Once set up, these methods will be further elaborated for direct application to sputum specimens. The molecular tool will be based on a modification of the novel technology named detection of immobilized amplified product in one phase system. This single step amplification method will be developed in a versatile microtitre well strip format for detection first of MDR and then of XDR strains. The tools will be then validated in different settings and prospectively evaluated in target populations. The project will contribute to the currently available armamentarium for rapid detection of drug resistant TB and will introduce new tools for the detection of the recently-described and highly-lethal XDRTB. It will also contribute to our knowledge on the mechanisms of M. tuberculosis resistance to second-line drugs.",0,0
18,204744,Yes,Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition,"When does citizenship provide a boost to migrant integration? A fast-track to citizenship can maximise the potential for settlement success, though too short a pathway can disincentivise integration. Not all migrants have an equal interest in naturalising and some are discouraged by restrictive policies. Yet little is known about why, how and for whom legal status transition matters and, especially, how policy variation impacts on this relation. Which migrants are most discouraged by stricter requirements for naturalisation? For whom carries citizenship the largest pay-off? Does it still matter if a migrant acquires citizenship after a long waiting period? This project combines for the first time the ideas that a) migrants have different motivations to naturalise; b) legal status transitions are conditioned by the institutional and socioeconomic contexts in origin and destination countries and c) the potential ‘integration premium’ associated with naturalisation is conditioned by the trajectory into citizenship.   The innovative project contributions are:   1. modelling migrants’ legal status transitions as life course events, which are shaped by migrants’ origin, their family context and societal structures and institutions;  2. analysing the relevance of citizenship for work and income, living conditions, health status and out-migration among immigrants and for educational attainment among their descendants;  3. developing novel methodologies to analyse step-to-citizenship trajectories and the impact of policy changes on status transitions and related outcomes among migrant groups and cohorts;  4. testing models on the basis of a unique combination of longitudinal register-based and survey-based micro-data in 8 European and North American countries, which provide the comparative context to analyse the impact of institutional variation;  5. yielding information for targeted citizenship policies to maximise settlement success for immigrants and their children.",1,1

Effectiveness of statistical data is a function of their spatial relevance and accuracy. Often official data are referred only to wider domains (e.g. NUTS 2 level) and, sometimes, the finer is the required spatial detail (NUTS3, NUTS4 level) the less accurate is the estimate. Local Government has to know accurate data referred to local areas and/or small domains (NUTS3, NUTS4 level) to 1) ensure monitoring of Poverty and inequality; 2) focus on special targets consisting of segments of population at higher risk of poverty (elusive populations) 3) appreciate the multidimensional nature of poverty and inequality with attention to the non monetary aspects of it (social exclusion and deprivation) 4) measure the subjective aspects of poverty as they are perceived by local groups and populations.  The aim of S.A.M.P.L.E. project is to identify and develop new indicators and models for inequality and poverty with attention to social exclusion and deprivation, as well as to develop, implement models, measures and procedures for small area estimation of the traditional and new indicators and models. This goal is achieved with the help of the local administrative databases. Local government agencies often have huge amount of administrative data to monitory some of the actions which witness situations of social exclusion and deprivation (social security claims for unemployment and eligibility for benefits from any of the programs Social Security administers) of households and citizens.",1,1
53,205960,Yes,Dynamics of Inequality Across the Life-Course: structures and processes,"Existing and rising inequalities pose fundamental challenges to European societies and economies. Large disparities in human and social capacities are counterproductive to a sustainable and creative economy and participatory governance and inclusion. The increasing gulf between rich and poor, exacerbated by the recent financial and economic crises, is a key concern. The sources of inequalities in contemporary societies are complex and highly intertwined and they and their consequences can only be understood through comprehensive, comparative and innovative research activities.   It is for this reason that the NORFACE Network is committed to launch a transnational research programme on the topic of Dynamics of Inequality Across the Life-course: structures and processes (DIAL). The DIAL programme will contribute to understanding the dynamics of inequalities as they unfold over the life-course, causal processes and drivers in relation to these inequalities, the role of time with regard to inequalities and the impact of these inequalities on social cohesion. The specific challenge of this Call is to address the dynamics comparatively in their social, cultural, economic and political dimensions and to disentangle the impact of past events and current circumstances on later outcomes to provide solutions to reverse inequalities across the life-course.  The NORFACE DIAL programme will coordinate the research efforts of the participating European Member States by implementing a joint trans-national call with European Commission co-funding to fund innovative comparative, transnational and interdisciplinary research initiatives within this thematic field. The NORFACE Network has received core funding under the European Union’s ERA-Net scheme since 2004 and has developed a close partnership of European national agencies responsible for funding research activities in the social sciences. The DIAL programme builds on the successes of the NORFACE Network.",0,1
343,221823,No,Self-Healing Hydrogels for Material-Assisted Cell therapy in Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is an incurable and painful disease. Over 70 million Europeans are currently affected by OA – a number that is set to increase with aging population and prevalence of obesity. To date, no clinically-efficient therapy exists to treat this socioeconomically debilitating disease. In this context, innovative regenerative therapies for joints are a pressing medical challenge.  Intraarticular mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) injections hold the great promise of stopping and reversing age-associated inflammation and degeneration of joints by providing the necessary trophic factors to mitigate immune responses. However, translational progress using conventional cell delivery (saline) has been seriously hampered by the limited control over cell survival, location and fate in damaged joints. It is now common knowledge that cell microenvironment plays a crucial role in the success of cell transplantation; and appropriate synthetic matrix design is key to success.  To address challenges in intraarticular MSC-based immunomodulation strategies, we have envisioned an original hydrogel-assisted cell therapy. In this strategy, an injectable hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel with long-lasting viscoelastic properties will allow MSC encapsulation and cytoprotection, ensuring the production of anti-OA soluble factors in vivo. To best mimic synovial environment and support MSCs in vivo, we will synthesize a novel boronic acid-based, self-healing HA hydrogel with unique properties of injectability, stability and fast relaxation under mechanical load.  After carefully characterizing the physicochemical properties of this new class of biomaterials, we will investigate the effects of cell encapsulation on adipose stromal cell (ASC) survival, morphology and factor secretion. Then, the preclinical efficacy of intraarticular injections of cell-loaded, self-healing hydrogels will be confirmed in two complementary OA mice models.",0,0
477,205623,No,Exploitation of Glycosylation Signatures for Precision Medicine,"GlySign is a research training network for the translation of glycomic clinical biomarkers for Precision Medicine (PM). Complex, distinctive changes occur in the glycomics profiles or - Glycan Signatures - of human glycoproteins during progression of many chronic diseases including cancer and inflammatory conditions. The three beneficiaries of the GlySign Consortium have been instrumental in contributing to knowledge in this field through development of glycomics technology and discovery of clinically important novel glycan biomarkers in a variety of diseases.  Glycan signatures have great potential for adding useful diagnostic and prognostic information in PM. However, advancement of this field is slow because (a) glycans have immense structural complexity resulting in major technical challenges for their analysis and (b) there is a lack of experts with required glycoanalytical skills. GlySign will address this gap by training six young scientists within an innovative training-by-research programme with high industrial-academic mobility to eventually push forward the translation of novel glycomics-based diagnostic tools into clinical practice. This will be achieved by further developing a range of selective and sensitive glycomics technologies for the analysis of samples from patients and healthy controls in close collaboration between industry/academia as well as clinical chemists and clinicians who will be the end users of GlySign’s final products. To this end, we will focus the training on clinical glycomics applied to four model diseases implicating changes in the glycosylation of circulating proteins specific to disease progression or subtype, i.e. diabetes, prostate cancer, fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and rheumatoid arthritis. Due to its strong industrial and translational focus, GlySign will, moreover, fill a current gap in the market by establishing new in vitro diagnostic platforms for clinical exploitation of glycomic biomarkers for PM.",0,0

By adopting the concept “Science invites People”, we propose a large scale REN, in 2016, at NCSR 'Demokritos', the largest Science Research campus in Greece, and a similar event in 2017 at at the Foundation of the Hellenic World, a multiplex where science meets entertainment and exploration, organized by the National Observatory of Athens. Based on past experience, we plan activities for an expected attendance of several thousand visitors. Our proposal involves activities from several scientific domains exemplifying in many cases the benefits of Interdisciplinarity. The activities will include the organization of pre-events, as part of the awareness campaign, as well as parallel events at three regions across Greece including Rhodes, Corinth and Pylos, where participating Institutions have satellite installations, so as to maximize impact and reach.  The purpose of the project is to convey to the general public the key ideas that Research is a necessary ingredient for progress, the Researchers are an integral part of the community and their profession is both fun, challenging, interesting and worth pursuing.

846,38861,No,"The response of Arctic Ice Masses to Climate Change Modelling, Remote Sensing and Field Measurements","In the future, governments will require increasingly sophisticated information on possible future sea level changes as input to the policy making process. The IPCC has identified the polar ice sheets to be the largest source of uncertainty in explaining the present rise in global sea level. The aim of this proposal is to predict the sensitivity and response of Arctic glaciers and ice caps to climate change over the next century, together with the associated implications for global sea level.  The programme has the following major objectives:  1. To use energy balance models on a representative set of ice masses in the Eurasian Arctic sector to predict their response to an envelope of future climate change scenarios. The deliverable product of this work will be quantitative predictions of glacier mass-balance and sea-level change at the century timescale. For the energy balance modelling to be undertaken successfully, a number of observed parameters are required to provide  (a) boundary conditions and  (b) independent datasets to test model performance.  2. To use a combination of field and satellite remote sensing data from Arctic glaciers to calibrate and test these models. Field data include meteorological and mass balance observations, and airborne and ground measurements of ice surface elevation, thickness and volume from radar studies. Satellite remote sensing data include measurements of ice-surface reflectance or albedo, the shifting position of the snowline, and the rate of mass loss through iceberg production.  Our main field study areas are in the Eurasian Arctic sector which, due to its location at the extremity of the oceanic currents and cyclone tracks transferring heat northward through the North Atlantic, is a highly sensitive part of the Arctic climate system. Key ice masses are Vatnajökull in Iceland, Austfonna in Norwegian Svalbard, Ziegler Island in Franz Josef Land and the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap in Russian Severnaya Zemlya These ice caps are located along a strong environmental gradient from relatively warm and maritime to dry and cold conditions within the Arctic. The Russian High Arctic archipelagos are some of the least well-known areas in the northern hemisphere. Information from this area is therefore important for our knowledge of the Arctic environmental system, especially in the context of global change. Field and remote sensing datsets will be archived digitally in an established database. Energy balance modelling of glacier mass balance will be carried out for ice masses throughout the Arctic using these newly acquired datasets together with existing observations from Greenland and the Canadian Arctic.  The proposal dovetails with several existing international science programmes, in which the partners already play leading roles:  1) The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) has a core science programme on the mass balance of Arctic glaciers and links with sea-level change.  2) The WCRP Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS) highlights the importance of linked Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean processes and variability in modulating the northern hemisphere climate.  3) The IGBP PAGES Programme, and in particular the PEP III environmental transect from the Eurasian Arctic sector southward.  4) The European Space Agency (ESA) Polar Ice Sheets Programme focuses on the links between satellite remote sensing ice sheet variability.  5) The proposal gives input to projects under EUs MAST-m-programme through its predictions of freshwater runoff to the Arctic seas and the implications for ocean thermohaline circulation.  The ICEMASS programme partners consist of institutions in seven European countries, and additional cooperating partners from two eastern European nations.",0,0
418,36113,No,Cephalopod resources dynamics: patterns in environmental and genetic variation,"The aim of this proposal is to improve understanding of the variability in distribution, abundance, and biological characteristics of economically important cephalopod stocks of EU waters of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean.  Specific objectives are:  1. To develop a GIS system for cephalopod fisheries in European waters and to integrate fishery, survey, and environmental data at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.  2. To refine the quantitative description of seasonal and inter-annual patterns of distribution and abundance of fished cephalopods and to develop models to predict their abundance from biotic and physical oceanographic parameters.  3. To use microsatellite DNA variation as an indicator of stock structure and interactions of neritic and oceanic cephalopod resources through the use of DNA marker 'tags', supplemented with allozyme and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies.  4. To integrate the new environmental and genetic approaches with recent findings on biological variability in the European cephalopod populations of the north east Atlantic and Mediterranean to evaluate whether this variation is due to plasticity of responses to environmental conditions or due to underlying genetic variation.  METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH TASKS  This project is still in its 1st year and progress has not yet been evaluated at full project co-ordination meetings. Consequently further details are given here of the proposed methodology and research tasks.  Task 1. Environmental Variation   To investigate the relationships between environmental conditions and the distribution and abundance of fished cephalopods of the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and Saharan Bank by means of the development of GIS together with related statistical analysis and modelling work. The main cephalopod categories of interest will be the fished species of long-finned squids (Loliginidae), short-finned squids (Ommastrephidae), cuttlefish and octopuses. Information will be compiled on at least two spatial scales: firstly, in low-resolution GIS for the entire northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and Saharan Bank fishery areas and, secondly, high-resolution GIS for selected sub- areas where detailed information on cephalopods is available.  Oceanographic, hydrographic and climatological data on appropriate temporal and spatial scales from a variety of sources, including remotely sensed data and outputs from models of air and water circulation, will be assembled with fishery landings and research cruise data for cephalopods. These data sources will be integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS). The GIS to be developed will necessarily operate at more than one spatial scale. For those areas where detailed fishery and/or survey data are available on the fished cephalopod resources (e.g. UK and French coastal waters, Spanish and Portuguese coastal waters, the Aegean Sea), high-resolution GIS systems will be established. Lower resolution, large-area systems will cover the NE Atlantic, Mediterranean and Saharan Bank areas as a whole. The differing biology and mobility of different cephalopod species, e.g. the relatively immobile cuttlefish and octopus as compared to highly mobile squids, will also necessitate different spatial and temporal resolution for the analysis.  Task 2. Genetic variation  The detailed objectives of this task are:  1. To develop a suite of DNA markers for commercially important cephalopod species in EU waters. 2. To use these markers to study the population structure of these species throughout their range. (In the case of some target species, this may involve extending somewhat beyond EU waters. 3. To compare patterns of genetic variation in the different species in relation to differing life history characteristics e.g. benthic/fixed or pelagic/mobile spawning. 4. Dependant on the success of marker development and findings on population structure - to address particular questions of management interest e.g. cryptic speciation, migration.  The source of DNA will be gills and possibly other tissues preserved in alcohol. The main markers involved will be microsatellites. We will attempt to isolate tri and tetra nucleotides to avoid sub-banding problems that are evident with the more commonly used and abundant dinucleotide. Modern enrichment methods will be utilised to achieve this. We will attempt to maximise throughput of samples by using automation (automatic sequencers etc). Depending on progress to have five or more variable micro loci utilisable in each species, then other markers such as mtDNA, PCRable minisatellites and transcribed sequences, may be investigated, since each have specific advantages in stock discrimination.  Task 3. Biological variation  To describe biological variation in fished cephalopods with respect to life cycle parameters such as age, growth and reproduction a limited programme of biological data collection will be undertaken.  New uses will be made of the extensive existing data sets for loliginids, and more restricted information for cuttlefish and some ommastrephid species. There will be limited new sampling for these species and for Octopus throughout the range of the study from which information on population structure, growth and reproduction will be collected. Improved methodology for the direct estimation of age from statoliths will be developed and applied to representative population samples.",0,0
269,201304,No,Unconditional parental regard: Its nature and its consequences,"Unconditional parental regard refers to parents accepting children for who they are, even when they disapprove of children’s achievements (e.g., school grades). Psychological theory holds that children internalize unconditional regard to feel worthy for who they are. Children may thus feel less pressured to excel, and become more intrinsically motivated and less afraid of failure. However, unconditional regard has received little empirical scrutiny. The main objectives of this 24-month Marie Curie IF-GF are (a) to investigate the nature and consequences of unconditional parental regard in childhood; (b) to provide advanced training in experimental research (pioneered by the partner organization) and intervention development (pioneered by the beneficiary); and (c) to provide advanced training in soft skills and entrepreneurial skills. Thus, it brings the applicant closer to mid-term career goals of becoming a leading expert and establishing a research group in the field of socialization—a field where the EU currently lags behind the US. In this project, one study explores how parents express unconditional regard (Study 1). Two experiments investigate the causal effects of unconditional regard on children’s self-worth and motivation (Study 2-3). An observational-longitudinal study investigates whether the effects of unconditional regard sustain over time in children’s lives (Study 4). The studies will be conducted in specialized laboratories under supervision of leading experts. The project strengthens the EU’s position in the field of socialization, and establishes a long-term cross-disciplinary collaboration between the applicant and participating parties. The results will have timely societal implications: Contemporary EU youth suffer more ill-being and motivational problems than did previous generations. To help alleviate these problems, the applicant will develop and implement an unconditional-regard intervention in partnership with EU health-care professionals.",0,0
910,52473,No,Does implementation matter? Informal administration practices and shifting immigrant strategies in four member-states,"The success of immigration policies in the EU has to date been doubtful and policy outcomes differ greatly between countries in spite of considerable convergence at the decision level. Our aim in this study is to highlight some of the mechanisms involved in policy implementation, which may account for the differential degrees of success in achieving the desired goals (i.e. control and integration). The focus of the research will be on the impact of the organisational culture of an institution and of the identity processes related to immigration on the implementation of specific policies. Moreover, the study will analyse how immigrants make sense of the social and institutional environment of the host country and adapt to it. Our aim is to reveal some of the weaknesses of current policy approaches to immigration and suggest alternative paths. Four countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, and UK) will be included in the project and a comparative, European perspective will be adopted.",1,0

Its main objectives are:  • Recommendations and guidance for future EU-Japan cooperation in the field of aviation Building on the SUNJET project, SUNJET II will produce consolidated roadmaps in the fields of Aircraft, Systems and Equipment, with the support of R&T institutions, Academics and Clusters. The roadmaps’ consistency as well as their level of granularity will be checked, key topics for future EU-Japan R&T cooperation in the field of aviation will be selected, with an assessment of the funding and time required, and concrete recommendations for future EU-Japan Calls will be produced, taking into consideration the EU and Japanese R&T mechanisms. A Guidance Desk will make available relevant guidance material, including recommendations and best practices to a wide community interested in building a joint research project between Europe and Japan in the future.  • Promote communication and networking between EU and Japan in the field of aviation A Forum of exchanges between European and Japanese stakeholders will be created. It will be comprised of four physical meeting sessions in Europe and in Japan. A virtual platform will also be set up to maintain communication and develop new contacts remotely between the meetings. Furthermore, a collaboration (web based) platform will be created, designed to host social and semantic functionalities in order to boost the communication between European and Japanese stakeholders.  Ensuring that the interested stakeholders will continue benefiting from the services and tools developed by SUNJET II even after the end of the project, the collaborative platform as well as the technical database connecting all roadmaps will be transferred to a permanent authority capable of maintaining it.

The project will contribute to the reduction of the environmental impact: - Weight saving of parts manufactured by the use of net shape and multi-thickness preforms with the right material at the right place, will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions, - Significant reduction of waste material by exploiting the composite at the maximum of its possibilities. It will help the industrials to be more efficient and performant: the above points automatically result in cheaper cost of the parts (less expensive material used by a better exploitation of materials, less composite waste implies therefore a better valorization of costly noble materials). QSP, developed for high rate production of automotive parts (one composite part/minute), will finally contribute effectively to reach the necessary productivity in the near future to meet the ramp up production of planes and aircraft components. The very short deadline imposed by the call (18 months) has guided the decision to build a small consortium with only 2 partners, Cetim (a French technological research center involved in composites since the 80’s) and Compose Tooling (one of the major French tool makers). These 2 partners are used to work together and are very agile to solve problems in a short time. Together, they have the complete skill to answer all the technical needs expressed in the call (design, manufacturing of parts and assemblies, material testing, NDT control, cost assessment, repairing). Cetim and Compose were involved in the implementation of QSP for automotive parts and have a clear strategy with other industrial partners to transfer this technology to aeronautic sector.",0,0
593,21925,No,Online Automated Sales and Information System,"The project aims to develop a new concept in electronic shopping. It will prototype a multimedia based service delivered through interactive sales terminals of ISTs. The project is driven by consumer and retail needs and will enable retailers and financial service providers to sell their products and services. The Project aims at delivering a prototype interactive sales terminal (IST) which retailers will develop applications for, to test a new delivery channel opportunity.  The specific objectives are to prove the viability of the new concept and to make significant technical and commercial advances which will results in the rapid acceptance and implementation of the project deliverables and results. These objectives will be achieved through carefully co-ordinated experimentation of the IST, development of multimedia sales applications which include electronic catalogues, the ability to browse, complete needs analysis, and the development of a generic payment module which will allow retailers to obtain payment for goods by plastic cards and by loan.   The commercial and technical advances resulting from the project are:   - Development of a multimedia based alternative to the traditional methods of selling will enable retailers to take advantage of new retail formats, making their products and services available to consumers in a wide range of formats both in store and public domain.  - Building on open standards and the advances made by earlier ESPRIT projects will result in the rapid development of a prototype for an object oriented platform for use at retail point of sale.  - The project provides advantages for consumers and retailers to use IST's instead of the traditional retail systems which are mainly paper based. The Project will develop a standard for multimedia applications, a business case for exploitation for interactive sales terminals and a payment module which will deliver loans and plastic card transactions. The partners will exploit their results by the realisation of project benefits for their own companies and by the development of a standards for multimedia Point Of Sale and Point Of Information applications.   The project has two phases:.   - In the first phase, a basic terminal or IST will be developed where the multimedia electronic catalogue is stored locally on a optical or hard disc. The terminal is connected to a central database from which volatile information such as price and availability is obtained.  - In the second phase, the integrated electronic retail system - the OASIS Market - will be developed. It will be based on access to sufficiently fast networks, where the product database including the multimedia electronic catalogue can be held centrally. This allow the retailer connected to the systems to sell products through the resulting infrastructure benefiting significantly from the lower data storage requirements which will help drive down cost of the terminal.",0,0
42,227512,Yes,Towards a postgrowth economics: A viable postgrowth economy without increasing inequality,"Economic growth seems unlikely to continue at current rates, if at all. But we currently do not have a plan of how to manage a postgrowth economy. This represents a major impediment to formulating policies for how the EU may best pursue its objectives for development, environmental protection, and the elimination of poverty in a future postgrowth economy. There is debate over whether our current economic system based on interest-bearing debt can be made viable postgrowth, and evidence that even slowing growth leads to increasing inequality. Here, I propose research to integrate existing theoretical research into postgrowth viability with research into measures to prevent inequality from increasing. Since no industrial economy has yet experienced prolonged periods of very slow or negative growth, I will test the predictions against historical case studies. The project will achieve four objectives: to identify the parameters in which a postgrowth economy is viable; to identify the parameters in which continually increasing inequality is also avoided; to test these parameters against historical case studies; and to draw on these results to evaluate policies for producing a postgrowth economy that is both viable and avoids inexorably increasing inequality.    The fellowship will allow me to broaden and deepen my knowledge of ecological economic approaches to postgrowth whilst bringing my knowledge of property economics, comparative institutions, and historical postgrowth to my hosts at ICTA. We will disseminate the results to academics and policy makers, with the historical aspect making quite technical debates much more accessible for communication to a wider public.  The fellowship will place me, and ICTA, at the forefront of the emerging field of theoretical and historical postgrowth research.

860,33788,No,Financial object-oriented requirements from user meetings,"User objectives: To be able to consolidate requirements and present these to more than one potential supplier, increasing the possibility for appropriate solutions. Furthermore creating a set of requirements is important, independent of different technology suppliers, which ensures that the development of solutions from the different suppliers ensures maximum freedom and flexibility. Consequently, the competitiveness for the users will increase. This could apply both nationally and in the European market.  The main objective for the suppliers will be: To be able too more rapidly respond to consolidated requirements and by that potentially increase market shares both nationally and on a European and global level.  Relevance to the wider community:  Due to the fact that the users will increase their competitiveness - their products can be tailored to their customers needs. Additionally this could be the initial activity to set up a marketplace for the suppliers and the users in the area of business-components.  ACTIONS  Description of the users in the network: Financial institutions are the users in the network. The companies that are going to participate must apply to the following general rules: They must have some experience in object orientation in analysis or in implementation, the companies must participate with both an OO-analyst and a senior business analyst.  Target audience: Technology suppliers, such as SNI and IBM have already started the development of object-oriented frameworks for financial services.   This technology provides a basis for a new class of systems with four different kinds of technology suppliers:  1) Framework suppliers: Companies that creates a basic set of related classes and components, which can be subclassed and specialised for particular applications and organisations. 2) Infrastructure suppliers: Companies that provide an underlying infrastructure, such as distributed object technology (i.e. OMG/CORBA and COM/OLE) and related services, such as database access and on-line transaction processing. 3) Component suppliers: Companies that provides functional services in particular domains as components that can be integrated in the framework. 4) Solution suppliers: Consultancy companies or the Financial institutions themselves - which assemble the components into integrated solutions.  The target audience is the four groups of technology suppliers identified, and the major players within each group. There is also an audience in various special interest groups and standardisation organisations, such as the OMG SIG on Financial Services, the Microsoft COM/OLE group on Financial Systems, and the IBM group on 'The banking OO-foundry'.  Mechanism for implementation: A series of workshops will be arranged during 1996 and 1997. Moreover we will set up world wide web or discussion group to ensure the flow of information between each workshop. The final report will be incrementally produced, throughout a sequence of five workshops.  EXPECTED IMPACT AND EXPERIENCE  The commercial impact of the FOORUM requirements will be: For the users: To get more appropriate solutions and a possibility for delivery of solutions from various suppliers. It is important that this will be user-driven in a way that can influence the current trends of having vendor-dependent user groups. User groups for the creation of object-oriented specifications of financial services are being established both by IBM, Microsoft and others. It would in addition be very useful to have a requirement group that is not dominated by one supplier. For the suppliers: To get access to a consolidated set of requirements from a representative set of users, and by that increasing the market potential for own solutions. This will represent a basis for a European market for financial solutions, as much of the solutions today are national.  The anticipated benefits will be: For the users: To be able to consolidate requirements and present these to more than one potential supplier, increasing the possibility for appropriate solutions. For the suppliers: To be able too more rapidly respond to consolidated requirements and by that potentially increase market shares both nationally and on a European and global level.",0,0
27,213410,Yes,The bargaining power of sending countries in influencing the rights of their low skilled migrant workers,"This project asks how governments of migrant sending countries can influence the rights of their low skilled migrant workers in receiving countries. The project approaches this question from both the sending and the receiving country side; looking at factors that determine when and how sending states intervene and what determines the responses from receiving countries. The surplus of aspiring migrants and economic importance of remittances would suggest sending states have little bargaining power. Single case studies however suggest that some nevertheless intervene. A comprehensive overview of the drivers of immigration and emigration policy will result in a set of hypotheses. A survey of policy makers in sending countries will generate an overview of interventions by sending country governments. The project’s core is a systematic comparative case study of six sending countries with partly overlapping receiving countries and three of these receiving countries. The sending country cases are three sets of two countries in which migrant remittances constitute a similar share of GDP but involvement with the rights of their workers abroad differ; the Philippines, Senegal, India, Ecuador, Morocco and Vietnam. The receiving countries are South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Italy. These countries vary strongly in the rights for migrant workers and the level of cooperation with sending states. QCA and process tracing will be used to assess the hypotheses. The project is innovative in 1) providing a systematic analysis of a larger number of cases including countries rarely covered in comparative studies on migrant rights, 2) examining of the actions of both sending and receiving countries, and 3) taking the trade-off between migrant numbers and rights into account. The project will push theory development forward by connecting theoretical fields and expanding geographic scope. It is policy-relevant by providing further insight into how the rights of migrant workers can be improved.",1,1
267,100719,No,Integrated Magnetic imAgery based on spIntronics Components,"Structures reliability, installations safety and products quality are requirements that industrial sectors must take into account. The stake is to guarantee the integrity of the structures. In transport and nuclear fields, a major stake of people safety is associated. To take up this challenge, industries are users of non destructive testing (NDT) which gathers methods providing information on the health of a structure without impairing its future usefulness. Among the existing methods, eddy current (EC) inspection is widespread by ensuring subjacent or surface-breaking flaws detection. Classical winding coils are the most commonly used EC sensors, but their spatial resolution and sensitivity are limited because of the technology itself. In this context, magneto-resistive (GMR, TMR) sensors are promising because of their frequency independent sensitivity, their small size, and their collective manufacturing process which facilitates the making of array probes. To improve the performances of the inspection methods, IMAGIC aims at developing a new integrated magnetic imagery based on high sensitive and spatial resolution GMR and TMR array sensors. The objective is to lead developments to the industrialization of smart systems combining technological developments (array sensor, integrated electronic) with sophisticated treatment tools (sensors design, flaw characterization). IMAGIC will ensure the increase of the probe sensitivity and spatial resolution: smaller and more buried cracks and located in complex zones could be detected. Magnetic probes based on new spintronics array components will also have important impact for biomedical and geological applications. In the current context of sustainable development, IMAGIC will promote the use of magnetic methods as an alternative method to penetrant inspection, whose exploitation is threatened due to the use of polluting products.",0,0

25,106043,Yes,Rethinking sources and consequences of business cycles,"'Up until 2006 most macro-economists held the view that combination of technology and monetary factors could explain the bulk of business cycles, and that overall business cycle fluctuations were not a major source of concern for policy (at least in developed economies and in the post-war).  The 2007-2009 crisis and its aftermath has radically shaken this view. First, most industrialized countries have experienced the largest and more synchronized downturn since the great depression and neither productivity nor monetary factors seem to have played a major role in it. Second the downturn has left profound scars on developed economies, in particular it has left a combination of high unemployment, large fiscal deficits, sluggish and unbalanced growth which are causing serious social discomfort together with political and international instability. The goal of this proposal is to better understand causes and consequences of the crisis. I intend to work on the 6 specific projects outlined below. All 6 projects are empirically motivated by the great depression and surrounding events, and all projects try to draw relevant policy implications from the analysis.  On the causes of the 2007-2009 crisis: i) Wealth and volatility. The project explores the role of self-fulfilling demand crises as a drivers of business cycles. Main finding is that situation in which asset prices (in particular housing prices) are low makes the economy more vulnerable to these crises. ii) Spatial Business Cycles. Project shows that increase in unemployment did not hit all US counties at the same time but rather started in few counties and over time spread to neighbouring areas. We draw lessons for the importance of housing prices and other local factors in causing, transmitting and amplifying fluctuations. iii) Dealing with International Financial Distress. Early work has shown that financial shocks can cause global decline and that they can emerge endogenously as confidence crisis in the global market for asset of defaulting firms. This project asks whether and how policies can avoid these confidence crises, keeping into account that policies of liquidity provision might increase risk taking. iv) The international China Syndrome. The project explores the role of new emerging manufacturing powerhouses such as India or China on macroeconomic performance of developed economies both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view.  On the consequences of the 2007-2009 crisis i) Inequality and the Great Recession. Project analyzes the distributional impact of the crisis and of the persistent unemployment in the US, using data on inequality in income, hours, wealth and consumption over the period 2005-2011. ii) Understanding the Euro debt crisis of 2011. This project uses a standard model of international limited risk sharing to assess whether the recent surge in sovereign spread paid by many European countries can be explained by macro fundamentals.'",1,1
214,81669,No,European Regional Agencies for Innovation Network,"This proposal concerns the organization of a Network of Regional Agencies in charge of the implementation of Regional policy plans. The main idea is to enhance their efficiency and help them to better use public funds for R&D and Innovation, thus contributing to spread an optimal usage of private and public investments.  The project intends to define practical methodologies and concrete guidelines for that purposes. E-RAIN involves 6 partners and 6 European Regions: ASTER-Emilia-Romagna-I, coordinator, C IDEM-Catalonia-E, Municipality of Grenoble-F, WRS-Stuttgart-D, VATI-West Pannonia-HU, GARR-Upper Silesia-PL.  The objectives of the proposal are: 1 - to optimize the utilization of R&D funds invested by private and public organizations avoiding bottlenecks and critical aspects generated by inefficient implementation procedures; 2 - to establish a European mutual learning platform based on that objective, connecting all those organizations that are involved in the process, with particular attention to new European member states  The Workplan is organized in five WPs. WP1 and WP2 are intended to build the mutual learning platform, through the analysis of regional situations and innovation plans and through the definition of an operational model for the implementation of those policies. Thematic aspects and cluster development are taken into specific consideration.  The WP3 is devoted to mentoring initiatives and to the enlargement of the network including new subjects in the activities, mainly from NMS. The WP 4 concerns the dissemination of results, the circulation of ideas and sharing of experiences addressed to those that are not directly involved in the proposal. The WP5 refers to the management of the project. In order to improve the circulation of information outside the partnership, an External Expert Group (EEG) has been organized, to generate new ideas, enhance the quality of results and deliverables and enlarge the dissemination ability of the partnership.",0,0
913,74011,No,Polarization and conflict,"The purpose of this multi-disciplinary research project is to promote and coordinate research on the conceptualization, modelling and measurement of polarization and conflict and the links between the two. We aim at contributing to identify the main forces leading to conflict, to provide tools and indicators for early warning, to understand the role of alternative forms of third party intervention such as mediation or arbitration in the reaching of an agreement, and to the design of post-conflict, viable ag reements, including the system of political representation. In order to achieve this task, we will integrate the different approaches that have independently been developed in the different social sciences and will combine models with factual evidence. We expect the outcome be a multidisciplinary understanding of conflict in which the analytical models will be tested against facts.",0,0

796,81511,No,Innovative particle trap system for future diesel engines,"Advanced Diesel combustion processes for passenger car Diesel engines such as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), or partial homogeneous combustion are developed for their potential to achieve near zero particulate and NOx emissions. One of the drawbacks of this technology is the difficult combustion control at medium and high load and consequently a limited operating range where NOx and particulate emissions are at a very low level. Therefore, future Diesel engines will combine HCCI at low load with partial homogeneity at part load and conventional Diesel combustion at high and full load. To cover these different loading areas a specific Diesel particle filter is necessary to reach PM and NOx emissions below the Euro V emission standards with a combination of regeneration strategies at low NO2 levels and low exhaust gas temperature due to efficient combustion processes. To achieve NOx engine out emissions below the Euro V level the engine has to be calibrated for low NOx emissions with the disadvantage of increasing soot at part and full load. Therefore the engines need traps. The accumulated soot in the trap can not reduced by continuous regeneration out of the missing NO2 in the exhaust leading to a higher active regeneration frequency at high trap temperature. To reduce high temperature soot oxidation trap material and catalytic coatings are necessary which allow trap regeneration below 650°C in an acceptable time. These targets will be achieved by a novel design of porous media and novel catalytic nanostructured materials in a compact unit, with tunable soot particle collection that will accommodate multifunctional catalytic coatings. With this content IPSY improves the environmentally behaviour and the market chances of future Diesel combustion processes. It meets the ideas of the general objective to strength the European Research Area of the priority 'Objective 1: New technologies and concepts for all surface transport modes'.",0,0
907,57473,No,European Programme for an Ontology based Working Environment for Regulations and legislation,"Many enterprises and citizens have difficulties in dealing with the ever-growing magnitude and complexity of (inter-) national rules and regulations. The business solution that will be developed in the E-POWER project will result in components designed for solving knowledge exchange between governments, citizens and enterprises. The proposed solutions will improve the quality and know ability of regulations, improve the access of public information, decrease the 'time to market' for implementing new regulations, and aid in harmonisation of laws and regulations within the Community.  OBJECTIVES E-POWER will implement a knowledge management solution by providing a method and tools that help to improve the quality of legislation whilst facilitating the enforcement of law. Both method and tools will decrease the time to market for new/changed legislation and facilitate the maintenance of legislation and improving the access to the governmental body of knowledge by offering new E-services. Furthermore the use of this method and tools will result in a more efficient us of scarce knowledge resources. The E-POWER project will result in transparency of pension arrangements for the (future) elderly citizens. The project will offer tools that help with the harmonisation of pension regulations. By providing easy access (using the Internet) to vital information the project will contribute to the social inclusion of citizens. E-POWER will consequently improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public administrations and contribute to the completion of the internal market.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The core of the E-POWER project is the method for translating legislation into executable (formal) specifications. Tools will be developed to do most of the translation of legislation automatically. Therefore translation patterns are applied and reused whenever possible. Thus the method ensures the achievement of the objectives such as reducing the time to market. The POWER-method will be used to develop decision support and information systems (DSSs) for pension regulations of two different EC countries. The development of these systems is carried out under the responsibilities of end-users in both countries, one public administration and one major financial and insurance company. Development and testing the formal descriptions (of the legal domain) and DSSs is supported by modelling and verification tools. General versions of these tools are input for the project, but they will be adapted in the first project phase to handle and produce E-POWER formal descriptions. In the second phase, the functionality of the tools will be expanded. These tools will be developed as separate deliverables and integrated in the E-POWER Suite. During the entire project, development will be guided by end-user evaluation (also by those in the User Platform to be established in the first project-phase). The composition of the consortium presents a balance between commercial and governmental parties, tool suppliers and end users. By working on pension regulations from different countries we will be able to highlight obstacles that hinder the harmonisation of pension regulations.",0,0

Current mood in the society supports a growing need to introduce researchers as people, solving the current problems of our society. Project is to present scientists as 'stars you don´t know about yet,' researching with direct relation to the everyday life. Partial aim is to present a possible attractive career of a scientist to young generation. The 2008 project is to follow the way, set by the 2007’s, keep the continuity  with same project title or logo as previous year but with the more effective communication methods. With the professional experience of SOVVA team members and those of each partner of the consortium, taken from the area of science, public policies and media, there is an ambition to attract even the wider part of the public.  Activities that will be organized during the night of 26th September 2008 are a big science show in one of the biggest retail and leisure centres in Bratislava with EU corner and many hands on experiments, presentations and simulations and a concert of researchers from universities and jazz band from the Slovak Academy of Science, science cafes, exhibition of photos of researchers as well as other activities organized by universities. Photos competition for secondary schools and universities will not only be interesting because we will see how students interpret scientists through photography but it will also help to attract their attention for the whole project. One of the most important aspects of this project is effective awareness campaign related to the project which is of a crucial importance for its success. We plan to use modern and attractive communication instruments like interactive and graphically interesting website with profiles of researchers, banner campaign that will be placed at very well attended web portals and many others.'",0,0
292,102137,No,CERAMIC AND POLYMERIC MEMBRANE FOR WATER PURIFICATION OF HEAVY METAL AND HAZARDOUS ORGANIC COMPOUND,"The main objective of the CERAMPOL project is to achieve a new generation of smart and low-fouling nanostructured membranes based on ceramic and polymeric materials with enhanced affinity to heavy metals and drugs. CERAMPOL will contribute in solving issues related to waste water in metallurgic and pharmaceutical industries/hospital respectively. Moreover, by reducing the concentration of highly toxic contaminants in the water supplies, lakes, rivers, and streams, the new filtration technology developed in the CERAMPOL project will mitigate the risk to humans’ health and the environment such as bioaccumulation of heavy metals, the emergence of multidrug resistance organisms, chronic toxicity, and metal-related diseases. The new filters will be prepared by innovative processes such as electrospinning, sol-gel, coating processes for obtaining multi-layered membranes possessing several key properties such as: antifouling; self-cleaning; selective filtration of antibiotics and heavy metals. Specifically, the multi-layered membranes will composed of three functional parts CERAMPOL functional parts: an anti-fouling pre-filter based on polymeric nanofibers, a cleaning system based on piezoelectric materials, and a highly selective nanostructured ceramic membrane. The new filters will be scaled up at semi industrial level for in-situ water treatments in foundry, pharmaceutical and hospital effluents. The benefits of such technology will be fully characterized in terms of water filtration efficiency and economic and environmental impacts. Complete technological and economical viability assessments of the CERAMPOL technology will be carried out by the industrial partners. Environmental impact caused by the new filtration technology will be fully assessed in order to highlight benefits in terms of water preservation and recovering.",0,0
835,195881,No,Bioinformatic approaches to identify and detect both disease- and drug-related genomic alterations in breast cancer patients,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among European women showing high clinical and molecular heterogeneity. Current clinical management causes patients overtreatment with implications on both patients’ quality of life and healthcare costs. Moreover, intrinsic or acquired tumor resistance to treatment leads to incurable metastatic progression in a significant proportion of patients.  Advances in cancer genomics highlighted a high inter- and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity, reinforcing the need for a mutation-based personalized treatment and a way to non-invasively monitor evolving disease. This project will significantly contribute in addressing such unmet challenge aiming 1) to identify altered breast cancer driver pathways, 2) to study their association with drug response and 3) to develop tools for a non-invasive assessment of such alterations.  By integrating multi-dimensional molecular data from more than 3000 cases, driver pathways will be identified and their association with previous breast cancer classifications as well as their prognostic significance will be studied. Their predictive power will be investigated in a matchless bio-bank of Patient Derived Xenografts, a much more reliable pre-clinical model, able to recapitulate inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity observed in patients. Multi-dimensional molecular data and high throughput drug screenings are available and will be integrated to identify novel pharmacogenomics associations. Mining of such amount of data will allow defining a portfolio of relevant breast cancer alterations that will be sought in plasma of patients from the DETECT trial, towards a non-invasive monitoring able to guide therapeutic strategy. Development and application of cutting-edge computational approaches is fundamental to reach above aims and it will constitute a major part of the efforts, considerably expanding Experienced Researcher's know-how in the field of cancer genomics and translational medicine.",0,0
134,96481,No,Future gazing TEL: the roadmap for the unknown Learning landscape,"This proposal focuses on topic f) of call 5: 'exploratory/Roadmapping activities for fundamentally new forms of learning' to support take-up of those new forms, via 'Awareness building and knowledge management on the results of EU RTD projects in TEL' and 'socio-economic evaluations in education and for SMEs'. We gather information on the current, desired and emerging position of TEL, and on awareness and appropriation (by educators and SMEs) of RTD results in TEL. We codify that information using state of the art knowledge management tools/ methods, at three levels of scale: 1) macro (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), 2) meso (organisation of education and training systems and institutions), and 3) micro (enacted paradigms of learning and teaching). Cutting across these levels of scale is the categorisation of changes as exogenous or endogenous relative to forms of learning and to the TEL community. This provides direct input to TEL-relevant decisions at all three levels, including economic, political, and research discussions. With a 10-year horizon, we co-develop a portfolio of stakeholder-specific roadmaps and influence maps, to gain insights into fundamentally new forms of Learning, Education and Training activities (LET) and into what makes for effective transfer and scalability. Our collaborative development approach leads to a Multi-perspective Dynamic Roadmap to track, anticipate and manage knowledge about new forms of LET and their impact on TEL. This extends established TEL Roadmapping methods in novel, powerful and cost-effective ways, with high potential for sustainability and for targeting each stakeholder's goals. Outcomes include well-grounded recommendations on TEL and LET innovations, plus a platform and a sustainable dynamic process that will foster collaboration and consensus-building across specialized communities and stakeholder groups.",0,0
105,96050,No,Enlightened or just less threatened: Education and anti-immigrant attitudes,"This research proposal combines the strengths of sociology and social psychology to investigate the effect of education on anti-immigrant attitudes. Many studies in the last fifty years have found that the higher educated have less negative anti-immigrant attitudes. Anti-immigrant prejudice can have many negative consequences for social integration in communities but also for EU integration. However, the exact nature of the effect of education is unclear, partly as a consequence of the difficulty of establishing causal effects using representative surveys. We will use recent methodological (implicit measures) and theoretical (group-based emotions) advances in social psychology to tackle this issue. Theoretically, the sociological and social psychological literature on the role of group threat is integrated. The proposed research consists of (1) a detailed analysis of the education effect on all types of anti-immigrant attitudes in existing studies, e.g. the European Social Survey, (2) a study with an educationally diverse sample including explicit and implicit measures of anti-immigrant attitudes, and also group-based emotions, and (3) experimental studies that further investigate the role of intergroup economic threat in educational differences in anti-immigrant attitudes. The researcher’s strong background in sociology and social psychology makes him well-prepared to carry out this project. The exceptional training environment offered by the School of Psychology at Cardiff University will ensure the successful execution of the project and particularly the training of the researcher in the fields relevant to this proposal and in which the School of Psychology has abundant expertise (intergroup relations, emotions, automatic aspects of attitudes). Finally, the extensive international collaborations of Professor Spears (the supervisor) will provide opportunities for the applicant to collaborate on related research and establish international connections.",0,0
7,222297,Yes,SOciO-eConomiC failurE and aSpiration biaseS,"From early childhood, many poor children brought up in segregated communities observe socio-economic failures such as poor living conditions, liquidity constraints, extremely high unemployment and low education levels attained by adults. Enhancing their aspirations is believed to be a tool capable of breaking one of the poverty feedback loops: poverty has been identified as a cause of the failure to aspire to one’s own potential, and at the same time, low aspirations are among the potential causes of persistent poverty. Consequently, adolescents from areas of high deprivation are generally believed to have low aspirations, though, in fact, their aspirations vary considerably, and may be generally high. This signals two main aspiration biases: aspirations failure and aspirational gap. This project is aimed to investigate how stimulating success/failure environments can reduce aspiration biases of the segregated poor, which, according to theory, should increase their chances to escape the poverty trap. The project has an interdisciplinary character: it is aimed to investigate the psychological construct of aspirations in the economic context in educational environments. Using cutting-edge methods from behavioural and experimental economics, we will experimentally investigate to what extent exposure to success/failure environments will lead to a significant decrease/increase in aspirational biases. From the methodological perspective, we will first design a novel approach to the experimental elicitation of aspirations, then we will design an experiment manipulating success/failure to assess their effects on aspirations. From the empirical viewpoint, using experimental data, the project will shed new light on the relationship between socio-economic background and aspirational biases, and thus test the predictions of economic theory. To address the concern of external validity, the proposed experiments will be conducted in different cultural settings.",1,1
