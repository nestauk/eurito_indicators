495,37087,No,Windtec 1200 kW-cost/light-weight wind turbine,"Objectives   The objective of the project is to develop a 3-bladed, 1.2 MW, variable speed, pitch controlled wind turbine, with (a) reduced tower head mass, (b) optimized energy yield for low wind speed regimes, and (c) improved logistics with strong emphasis on the erection of the turbine without crane. The combination of all these improvements are expected to lead to reduced costs of power production, whereby the goal is to produce electrical power for 0.038 ECU/kWh in a wind regime of 8 m/s at a hub height of 60 m.    Technical Approach   Above objectives are achieved by developing various new components as: (1) Improved variable speed power electrics on the basis of a doubly fed induction generator.  (2) Integrated drive train design with the main target of reducing weight and costs.  (3) Light weight rotor blade design, utilizing carbon fibre technology. (4) Optimized slip-form concrete tower designed to reduce costs and to improve the dynamics of the complete system.  (5) Modular nacelle design including an on-board erectable crane system, which allows the nacelle and the rotor to be installed without an external mobile crane.  After the engineering phase a prototype will be manufactured and installed in the eastern part of Austria.  Loads and performance measurements will be performed and reported under the Scientific Measurement and Evaluation Programme (SMEP), which was developed for the WEGA-II machines.  The analysis of the measurements will be the basis for (a) the validation of the design and the performance of the wind turbine, and (b) further improvements of the design.    Expected Achievements and Exploitation   The expected outputs of the project are:  (1) Validation of software programs by comparing dynamic simulations with measurements.  (2) Development of a variable speed power electrics system, which is highly efficient and at the same time very cost effective.  (3) Development of a light weight rotor blade with high aerodynamic efficiency.  (4) Improvement of the logistics for the installation of a MW-class wind turbine.   The combination of all these features should lead to a wind turbine with substantially improved economics by guaranteeing excellent power quality.",0,0
781,209927,No,Algorithmic Finance: Inquiring into the Reshaping of Financial Markets,"Present-day financial markets are turning algorithmic, as market orders are increasingly being executed by fully automated computer algorithms, without any direct human intervention. Although algorithmic finance seems to fundamentally reshape the central dynamics in financial markets, and even though it prompts core sociological questions, it has not yet received any systematic attention. In a pioneering contribution to economic sociology and social studies of finance, ALGOFINANCE aims to understand how and with what consequences the turn to algorithms is changing financial markets. The overall concept and central contributions of ALGOFINANCE are the following: (1) on an intra-firm level, the project examines how the shift to algorithmic finance reshapes the ways in which trading firms operate, and does so by systematically and empirically investigating the reconfiguration of organizational structures and employee subjectivity; (2) on an inter-algorithmic level, it offers a ground-breaking methodology (agent-based modelling informed by qualitative data) to grasp how trading algorithms interact with one another in a fully digital space; and (3) on the level of market sociality, it proposes a novel theorization of how intra-firm and inter-algorithmic dynamics can be conceived of as introducing a particular form of sociality that is characteristic to algorithmic finance: a form of sociality-as-association heuristically analyzed as imitation. None of these three levels have received systematic attention in the state-of-the-art literature. Addressing them will significantly advance the understanding of present-day algorithmic finance in economic sociology. By contributing novel empirical, methodological, and theoretical understandings of the functioning and consequences of algorithms, ALGOFINANCE will pave the way for other research into digital sociology and the broader algorithmization of society.",0,0
86,225654,Yes,Endeavour Space Hub,"The overall aim is to expand the impact and adoption of Space Tech by bringing together Space start-ups, SMEs, entrepreneurs and the IoT ecosystem to increase commercial relevance of the technologies across industrial sectors and accelerate their access to market and/or scaling. We will achieve this by designing and orchestrating a collaborative ecosystem with adapted tools and instruments that will position a greater number of space-enabled technologies in industrial markets. This ecosystem will be based on a blended community of IoT and Space that brings together a range of stakeholders, large and small, from academia, business and the public sector not just across the three local ecosystems that are directly taking part.

Main Objectives   - To develop a Framework that enables regional health care business strategies.  - The development of a Methodology that identifies regional health care business processes and develops a supporting IT strategy  - The development of an Open Health Environment consisting of an Archi-tecture and Information Standards that support the SHINE Common Services  - The production of a System Architecture that defines the construction of inter-related common services in the support of regional health care  - To work with standards organisations and to adopt health-care informatics standards applicable to the SHINE Framework  - A set of common telematic application services that support regional health business needs will be prototyped.  - To construct three pilots, in regions in Italy, Ireland and Portugal, to validate and demonstrate the results of SHINE  - Increase the awareness of the SHINE Framework  - To work towards providing inter-regional health care information ex-change standards and protocols   Technical Approach   The first year has focused on developing the SHINE Methodology (a Business Analysis methodology for health care) in parallel to its application in the pilot sites and elsewhere. During the first few months of the project, extensive training and development of the methodology took place, later applied in detail in each pilot region to identify the telematic services to support the real business need. Deliverable D3, produced at the end of September 1992, contains the results of this work. The development of the SHINE Methodology is a major piece of work that can be exploited at an early stage by the consortium. It will remain restricted until the project finishes in 1994.   The SHINE Methodology has been used extensively to identify the key business processes and to align the IT strategy in the three different pilot regions (in Italy, Ireland and Portugal), and also to a lesser extent in other countries' non-pilot regions. The three pilot regions are at different stages of using IT, have different health care systems and therefore present contrasting opportunities for telematic services.   The final analysis of the application of the SHINE Methodology has yet to occur but a number of common telematic services have already been identified which will be further examined as detailed requirements are being gathered. Opportunities have also been identified for redefining some of the roles and processes within the regions.   The process of validating the business oriented models of the SHINE Methodology before detailed system specifications can be developed, involves building functional models. SHINE is using the UK's Common Basic Specification (a model of the UK's National Health Service) to assess the correlation between the CBS models and the situation that exists in the pilots and non-pilots. It will enable future users of the SHINE Methodology to use a formal specification tool to develop functional specifications. The result of this work is now available.   Part of the process to ensure that the results of SHINE meet real needs is to have regular validation (by an external panel of experts) and workshops in each country with representatives from the central or regional policy making organisations. The first result of this process has resulted in a deliverable describing the health care policy and IT strategy in each country involved in SHINE. A video has also been produced that describes the SHINE philosophy and presents a scenario for telematic services.   As the analysis and modelling activities draw to a conclusion, so the development of detailed specifications of the user requirements and information requirements have to start. These take the form of detailed interviews to obtain the user requirements, and the development of data flow diagrams to describe the information requirements. These provide the baseline to develop a functional architecture of regional health care.   The developments for the pilots will share a common architecture that will be published at the end of the project as the Open Health Environment (OHE) for regional health care. It aims to be compatible with, and interface to, the emerging standards for hospital systems (e.g. RICHE), with the ENS medical backbone, and will be conformant with CEN TC251 standards. Contacts have already been established with these groups.  Having identified the common services and the pilot-specific services, the project will commence prototype development based, where possible, on existing application system software. A period of installation and testing will occur before the pilot trials take place. The evaluation will be undertaken by repeating on a smaller scale the work during the analysis phase with the objective of assessing the outcome of the enhanced IT infrastructure. The health care professionals will be interviewed for their views on the changes to the working practices. Quality will be monitored, both of the telematic services, and in the measurable improvements in health care provision and outcome.  Throughout the project, an area of work will be concerned with exploitation, liaising with national health organisations, standardisation bodies, etc. Widespread acceptance and use of the SHINE Framework are critical to the success of the project. Therefore the consortium attaches great importance to this work area as a means of ensuring bilateral exchange of ideas, concepts and European standardisation based on open system solutions.   Key Issues   The project's tenet is that linking people together through IT is much more significant than straightforward data transfer and redefining time and distance: it involves linking people's skills and computing services, wherever they are located, to problems needing those skills and services, wherever they arise. Enhanced team working and sharing of skilled and expensive resources is possible through a combination of networked health care informatic services and the resulting potential for redefining the health care business.  One key issue, from a strategic point of view, is how best networks and existing technologies or standards can be used to create telecommunication services that both satisfy the demands for better health care as well as providing a value added service to the region.   Other project issues include:   - collaboration and synergy with other projects - this project has to work closely with other projects within AIM, ESPRIT, RACE and ENS. The key strategic projects have been identified and cooperation has commenced.  - awareness of new developments - the project will not undertake any developments where there already exists a solution  - links with other bodies - the project will work with the CEN and EWOS working groups along with other relevant activities. Again, contacts have been made and members of the SHINE consortium are already active across many of the standardisation work groups and project teams.  - dissemination - one of the key activities of the project is to widely disseminate the results and to place them in the public domain. An initial exploitation plan has been produced.   Relationship to Previous Work   The SHINE project's origin comes from different parts of the CEC Framework Programme. There are links from:  - HOSCOM, CHIC, McACE and others from AIM  - ISA, RICHE, BANK92 and the RIBA work of ESPRIT  - TELEMED and TELEMEDICINE within RACE   Links have been formed across programmes to the current ENS and RACE health care activities.  Members of the consortium were directly involved in the previous ambulatory (regional/community health-care) projects and bring the results of this work into SHINE. There was also involvement was with RICHE that has developed a framework for hospital systems and this experience will be used extensively in SHINE during the technical developments in years 2 and 3.   Expected Impact   National and Regional Government (i.e. Health Policy):   - improvements in public health through the effective use of health resources  - better epidemiological and health service research  - planning for new health care facilities, e.g. hospitals  - financial control of state provided health care  - opportunities to evolve the provision of health care to meet local needs  - better cooperation between the private and public health sectors   Health care Funding Organisations:   - more efficient communication of billing information  - reduced administrative procedures  - improvements in statistical data with respect to delivered care   Hospital Management   - reducing the gap between primary and secondary care  - well defined systems interface between the hospital information system and External world  - automated patient details transfer  - promoting new hospital services and facilities   Community Health care Providers   - data set capture as a by product of community clinical system  - logically integrated management tools running over wide area distributed systems  - quicker referrals and timelier patient data   General Practitioners   - better able to work in healthier market  - monitoring acute service costs, drugs, tests, etc.  - simplified patient referral and follow up process  - health promotion in the community   Patient   - reduced stress of working with the health system  - able to compare health services  - consumer surveys  - better health education   Relationship to Other Projects and Actions   Within AIM, coordination agreements have been put in place with three projects - EPIC, FEST and NUCLEUS, and with the CARE project from the ENS programme. Significant progress was made with identifying the core projects within AIM that are likely to be most useful in the context of concertation and collaboration. Close relationships have been established with these projects both through the AIM Concertation meetings and through having common participants with those in SHINE. The three AIM projects with which some degree of coordination has been developed are FEST, EPIC and NUCLEUS. SEISMED (a project addressing security) will be important to SHINE in year 2 during the development of the SHINE architecture. The NHS-IMC is a partner common to both SHINE and SEISMED.   FEST plans to develop a framework for telemedicine applications by performing a bottom-up technology-driven analysis of requirements that is complementary to SHINE's top-down business analysis approach. The strong telecommunications skills of FEST also complement SHINE's strong applications and services capabilities.   EPIC is a clinically oriented project developing systems for remote care in the home. SHINE can be of benefit in defining the regional infrastructure and services needed to support effective home care. The proposed coordination between SHINE and EPIC starts with a low dependency coordination in year 1 progressing to greater cross-dependencies in year three, but subject to an annual review. Providing both projects agree this could lead to joint working on security, architectures and possibly SHINE results feeding into an EPIC pilot. Both SIMS and IHI are common to both SHINE and EPIC.   NUCLEUS aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a multimedia integrated patient dossier (based on the RICHE concepts) within the hospital setting. The link with SHINE is in two main areas:   - extending patient management from the hospital out into the primary and community health care sectors  - systems architecture, particularly in the area of Open Distributed Systems, platforms   SIG, LISPA and NHS-IMC are common to both SHINE and NUCLEUS. Within the ENS programme there is a health care project called CARE. This project is in the field of emergencies, food safety, statistics and pharmacovigilance. It could provide the 'backbone' links between SHINE regions and for this reason an agreement between SHINE and CARE has been agreed.  Within ESPRIT, the EDITH project is piloting the results of RICHE in Italy, Ireland and Portugal (although not in the same regions as SHINE). LISPA is common to EDITH and SHINE so this link will be exploited.   Testbed Sites and Verification   Italy   Lombardia Informatica (LISPA) currently manages a wide area network, connecting different poles in different geographical sites. The network inter-links USLs, hospitals and regional offices as well as the central regional government.  It is based on an open distributed architecture on top of an X.25 platform; at the present time the network connects multi-vendor computers and workstations (IBM, BULL, OLIVETTI etc).   In particular the LISPA regional network contains:  - about 2000 local and remote workstations  - about 550 local and remote printers  - about 280 remote sites  - about 200 LANs (Ethernet, Token-Ring, etc)  - connection with ITAPAC (the Italian packet switching network) and through it with external data banks.   Ireland   The existing infrastructure in the North Eastern Health Board consists of very basic PC based systems in place in both the community and hospital based programmes. It is not possible to link any of the systems in use at present. There is very little formal linkage between the hospital and community based services.   Essentially this is a green field site in a remote under-developed area of the European Community. A substantial telecommunications network exists through an Bord Telecom and its potential for use in the Health Service has not yet been explored in Ireland.   A commitment to approximately 700 kECUs capital expenditure over 2 years has been entered into by the Irish Department of Health in respect of the North Eastern Health Board. This is providing the necessary infrastructure for the SHINE pilot.   Portugal   The Portuguese pilot region is the Regiono de Aveiro. It currently does not have any health care information network infrastructure. Currently the hospitals and health centres only have personal computers. Some are connected via LANs (Novell in DOS environments, Ethernet with TCP/IP in Unix environments). The databases in use are currently ORACLE and DBASE.   Portugal does have TELEPAC (the National Data Network). There is currently a study to see what is the best way to produce a health care information network, possibly using the services of TELEPAC with improvements (e.g. voice and data images), or maybe by satellite.",1,0
806,226008,No,All Solid-sTate Reliable BATtery for 2025,"'Europe is facing a major challenge to develop and produce a competitive Li-battery product in order to avoid dependency on third countries in its energy transition models. The Li-ion cell innovations should meet specific technical and economical requirements to sustain the market growth. The all-solid Li-ion technology appears to be one of the relevant options but it still has to be brought to higher TRL to be economically and environmentally friendly for a mass production compatible process. The ASTRABAT project gathers 14 partners, leaders in the different fields of research, development and production, from 8 countries. It aims to find optimal solid-state cell materials, components and architecture that are well suited to the demands of the electric vehicle market and compatible with mass production. The project will comply with improved safety demands and industrial standards.  Five ambitious objectives were defined: 1.       Development of materials for a solid hybrid electrolyte and electrodes enabling high energy, high voltage and reliable all-solid-state Li-ion cells 2.       Gen#2D cell design: processing techniques compatible with existing routes of large scale cell manufacturing (10Ah, Energy type) and validation of a pilot prototype in a relevant industrial environment 3.

981,101832,No,"The theoretical, empirical and policy foundations for building social innovation in Europe","The European Commission’s Innovation Union strategy clearly places innovation at the centre of the policy agenda for meeting social challenges affecting Europe and its Member States. The field of social innovation is developing rapidly all over the world, with new institutions, methods and activities. However, at present the ability for Europe to coordinate and galvanise its undoubted potential across Member States is limited by the lack of the systematic and sophisticated infrastructures of support available to other fields. These include the absence of:  - reliable metrics for assessing the effectiveness and impact of innovations, and of policies and programmes to promote social innovation; - effective capital market instruments and financial supports; - suitable regulatory and policy frameworks for ensuring scale and impact - a codified and widely understood set of methods; - networks and other vehicles to spread methods, learning and skills; - co-ordinated leadership; and - enabling cultures.  This consortium of leading European research institutions and global experts in social innovation has designed a programme of work to build the theoretical, empirical and policy foundations for building social innovation in Europe. The objective of this research programme is to prepare the way for developing the tools, methods and policies which will be part of the EU strategy for social innovation. Its purpose is to strengthen the foundations for other researchers, policy-makers and practitioners so that they can analyse and plan with greater confidence.  As such the research programme will map the field, reviewing theories, models, methods and identifying gaps in existing practices and policies, as well as pointing towards the priorities for future strategies.",1,0
615,101058,No,A Microfabricated Actuator for Active Flow Control on Aircraft,"This is a proposal for the design, manufacture and testing of an innovative prototype microfabricated pulsed flow control actuator for implementation at aircraft scale. The innovative actuator concept is one that was originally developed under previous EU RTD projects (AEROMEMS and AEROMEMSII) and demonstrated to achieve exit velocities in excess of 300 m/s at frequencies ranging between 0 and 1kHz through a 45 degree pitched orifice having a diameter of 0.4mm. This proposal extends the design of the actuator to demonstrating the required performance through a 1mm diameter orifice (as requested by CfP) and to the improvement of the fabrication processes to reduce costs and to increase production yield to levels in excess of 80%. The proposal involves demonstration of innovative manufacturing techniques to improve the accuracy of rapid grinding methods for brittle ceramics, demonstrate the use of pico- and femto-second pulsed lasers for low-damage cutting of ceramic/metallic sandwich structures and to improvement of electrical connections within the actuator. The work entails the design, fabrication and testing of the actuator and will build on significant experience and past investment. The maturity of the current actuator design concept, particularly with respect to the consideration of aircraft integration and a large range of environmental testing that has been undertaken will provide a low-risk route to realising a concept that will be close to practical implementation. During the design process advanced computational analysis tools will be used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the actuator and build upon the already considerable results and experience already gained. The multi-disciplinary team that will deliver this project has many years experience in the development of micro-fabricated sensors and actuators for flow control applications on aircraft and has the skills, tools and facilities necessary for a successful project.",0,0
262,222091,No,Multifunctional Hierarchically-Structured Systems for Energy Storage Devices,"The widespread use of portable devices, as well as the electrification of transport, require a new generation of energy storage devices that deliver higher specific performance than Li-ion batteries. By designing multifunctional materials that combine structural and electrochemical energy storage, an improvement in gravimetric and volumetric efficiency can be achieved. The research aim of this project is to develop Energy Storage Devices based on multifunctional hierarchically-structured systems. The success of the project will be driven by the combination of two strong and complementary areas of expertise: At Imperial and IMDEA, the fellow will work for 24 months in groups with an extensive experience of carbon and inorganic nanomaterials synthesis, modification, characterisation, and application, particularly on hierarchical systems. On the other hand, she will bring her own experience in developing and characterising electrodes and electrolytes for a wide range of batteries as well as supercapacitors. The interdisciplinary intersection of new materials chemistry, with electrochemical device engineering, and structural composite mechanisms, will provide a unique opportunity for rapid progress in both science and technology. The structural energy storage devices will be developed from technology readiness level 1 and to 4, in order to accelerate direct impact on industrial applications, for example in the automotive and electronics sectors. During the two-year project, the fellow and supervisor will disseminate their results to Industry, Academia and General Public through patents and articles in podcasts, newspapers and scientific journals. From the start, an individual career development plan for the fellow will be developed with the supervisor and will be reviewed regularly during the fellowship.

671,94688,No,Information and Communication Technologies \nfor the Full Electric Vehicle,"The proposed coordination action addresses enabling technologies of full electric vehicles (FEV). The focus of the initiative is set on ICT which open new technology paths towards energy efficiency, functionality and usability and are complementary to future advances in performance of battery cell technology. To fight climate change, cut emissions and secure energy supply, transport based on FEVs will soon be strongly demanded by public and private stakeholders worldwide. It can be foreseen that early technology leadership will be determinant for the global competitiveness of major European industries such as the automotive, energy and ICT sector.ICT4FEV is aiming at building a R&D community, creating a European roadmap and recommending standards, regulations, business cases and R&D priorities for the FEV. In its core consortium it will therefore bring together for the first time major industrial partners to start a dialogue on a common understanding about impact, R&D priorities, infrastructure needs and requirements.

3,86438,Yes,INNOvation beneFITs Europe,"Having registered in 2006 the highest number of patents world-wide, Europe is deficient in benefiting from investments in knowledge. There is little demand for technology and customer oriented products and services. The goal of INNOFIT is to further the regions’ capability of “demand creation”, which allows SME, larger firms and research institutions to benefit from sales of products and services based on its knowledge. The proposal follows the strategy of “backing European winners” in their effort to catch up with global best regions. The consortium is composed of European SatNav regions, currently undertaking Galileo project.  The proposal is produced by the best Research and Development Clusters of the European Galileo/SatNav industry: Holland Rijnland and regions of Munich, Rome and Prague and its innovation and entrepreneurship centres. Aim of INNOFIT shall be focused on excellence in capability of demand creation for the Galileo downstream market from which a new 9 Billion € industry with over 140.000 jobs is expected to emerge. To achieve this INNOFIT will identify global best practices (WP 2) and state-of-play in the European regions of knowledge with show cases of demand creation capabilities that are adapted to European regions (WP 3). Integration activities in a joint action plan take place in WP4. Sustainability of project results is driven by the need for demand creation for new services from Galileo that will be operational by the end of INNOFIT. The innovation of INNOFIT is to assume that demand is not a given but can and need be created by forward looking activities of managers and policy makers. The focus here is on entrepreneurial initiatives supported with open innovation environments and living labs so that future customers and developers interact in the creation of new innovative services for Galileo applications. The project results will be disseminated through mentoring in the network of SatNav regions (WP5) and beyond SatNav industries limits.",1,1
635,197176,No,The Development of a »New« Planocentric Gearbox with a Closed Cage and S-gear Tooth Flank,"The planocentric gearboxes are complex mechanical devices with precisely manufactured components, particularly suitable for automation and mechatronic subsystems. On the market, several solutions are available, none of which cope with the main disadvantages of the technology. The most common drawbacks of these solutions start with a single cage design structure which suffers in looseness and unfavourable shaft loading. A precise manufacturing and assembly is of utmost importance in the case of the cycloidal planocentric gearboxes, so manufacturing costs could be increased. Moreover the gear ratio is limited. Additional problems, in lantern gears, are sliding and efficiency. All in all, current gearboxes are not fully optimised and present a high lifecycle impact on the environment. S-Gearbox project is dedicated to eliminating the common drawbacks and replacing several metal parts with plastic material, increasing the overall reliability and recyclability of the gearbox. Our goal is to develop a new planetary gearbox as small and as lightweight as possible, with low hysteresis for accurate positioning, high torsional stiffness, low inertia, high efficiency, overload capacity, lifetime lubrication, no maintenance.   Developed and optimized S-gearbox will have tremendous potential to be used for different applications primarily in automotive and aerospace industry but also many other industries, such as: wind turbines industry, household appliances, mechatronic devices, industrial equipment and medical equipment.  The main aims of our proposal at this stage of development of the technology, are to finalise the analysis of all the remaining technological risks associated with our innovation and proving our solution in an operational environment in automotive or airspace industries, to assess the size of potential market, outline a full product development, IP protection and marketing strategy and to assess the environmental burden.",0,0
74,52086,Yes,Sustainable urban transportation,"Problems to be solved. Transportation problems are among the most pressing strategic development problems in many cities, often a major constraint for long-term urban development in general. The problems to be solved are the inefficiency of urban transportation systems and underlying land use patterns, which negatively affect quality of life, economic efficiency, and the environment; the high (and often hidden) costs of urban transportation in both socio-economic and environmental terms; and in particular the environmental consequences both in terms of physical aspects that include land and resource use, ecological aspects, and human health problems. Tools for comprehensive strategic analysis that are directly useful to city administrations are lacking. New strategies for sustainable mobility will require a combination of measures with impacts on improved land-use/economic development planning; improved planning, management and use of transport infrastructures and facilities; incorporation of the real costs of both infrastructure and environment in investment policies and decisions and also in user costs; development of public transport and improvement of its competitive position; continued technical improvement of vehicles and fuels; encouraged use of less polluting fuels; promotion of a more environmentally rational use of the private car, including behavioural changes. Scientific objectives and approach These problems can only be addressed with a consistent and comprehensive approach and planning methodology that helps to design strategies for sustainable cities. This will include an integration of socio-economic, environmental and technological concepts including the development, integration, and demonstration of methodologies to improve forecasting, assessment and strategic policy level decision support. From a technical perspective, the project aims to develop and apply an indicator based approach compatible with Agenda 21 and common indicators for urban sustainability for a baseline analysis, ranking and benchmarking (within the participating cities and across all of Europe) that will ultimately support a discrete multi-criteria selection mechanism. It will use traffic equilibrium modelling to evaluate alternative transportation policies, including multi-modal systems and their relation to land use, technological development, socio-economic development, and spatial and structural urban development (land use scenarios) in general. Air quality modelling will be used to translate transportation scenarios and their resultant emissions into ambient air quality estimates and population exposure. Economic analysis and energy systems analysis and modelling using well established modelling approaches such as MARKAL, will identify and evaluate cost effective transportation scenarios, consistent with the larger economic and technological framework. Environmental impact assessment is used for the comprehensive evaluation of alternative transportation scenarios, using a rule-based checklist approach to cover environmental effects beyond air pollution, such as noise, waste including the complete life cycle of vehicles, space and resource requirements for the transportation infrastructure and its maintenance, and the effects of accidents. The long-term development scenarios, defined for each of the case study cities, will consider the current base line, a do-nothing scenario and a set of probable development strategies in terms of demographic, socio-economic, spatial and structural (land use), and technological developments over the next decade and beyond (30 year horizon). Expected impacts The primary expected impact is to improve the quality of urban life, health and safety by contributing towards sustainable transportation in sustainable, economically efficient, attractive, enjoyable and liveable, cities. Solutions for sustainable transportation leading to the improvement of the quality of life in urban communities and the associated urban regions, and thus the competitiveness of European cities are the goal. A better information basis, planning and decision support tools designed for the direct use by city administrations is the means. Citizen and stakeholder participation in urban decision-making processes, but also the underlying awareness building and educational aspects will be supported by making the project results available as a public information system on the Internet. SUTRA will also contribute to the implementation of European policies, Directives, and guidelines, including the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development (OJ C 138, 17/05/1993), the Air Quality Framework Directive (96/62/EC) and several Community Directives and communications related to transportation and sustainable development.",1,1
798,217549,No,Cybersecurity anomaly detection solution for critical infrastructures,"SIGAGuard is a next generation cybersecurity technology measuring low-level electric signals in order to detect at an early stage cybersecurity threats and operational anomalies in ICS-SCADA systems. SIGAGuard is the first cybersecurity solution today that monitors electrical signals generated between the control systems (PLC) and the end-point. This is important because 1) it makes the SIGA technology itself immune to cyber-attacks, as well as completely transparent to cyber-attacks on the SCADA system it is monitoring, and 2) it means that SIGAGuard effectively “insulates” the SCADA-controlled equipment from any outside interference (hacking) via the rest of the system, and can provide accurate early warning when an anomaly is detected, reducing unexpected equipment damage and increasing operational safety, efficiency, and reliability. SIGAGuard has successfully been tested with 2 large Israeli operators (Hagihon Water Company and Israel Electric Corporation)  and is ready to be rolled out into the critical infrastructure protection market, estimated to grow from €90Bn in 2016 to €130 Bn by 2021 (source: Market and Markets).  SIGAGuard is sold as a package of hardware and software (one-time fee depending on size/complexity, average €250k per customer) plus a 15% annual fee for service & maintenance. Unlike competing solutions that can be deceived by advanced malware able to feed fake operational parameters to supervisory systems, SIGAGuard is deployed at the lowest tier of the infrastructure (end point), providing direct feedback on the physical parameters (electric signals) of the industrial components to be monitored. This capability makes SIGAGuard the first uncircumventable solution for the detection of anomalies in critical infrastructures.  SIGA is led by the former Director and the Deputy Director of Israel’s National Cyber Security Authority.",0,0
295,204574,No,"Development of a modular, integrated and autonomous ‘Factory-in-a-box’ production line for manufacturing high volumes of Flexible integrated LogIC circuits","Our Flexible Integrated Circuits (FlexICs) are recognised by the likes of ARM as a disruptive innovation that will change the formation of the semiconductor industry significantly. We are PragmatIC Printing Ltd, pioneers of design, development and manufacture of non-silicon ICs on plastic. Our FlexICs are; thinner than a human hair; ultra-flexible and offered in flattering form factors and footprints that conventional silicon cannot offer. Our processes allow FlexICs to be produced on a large scale at a low cost; the marginal cost per IC in volume production can be <€0.1c. Non-silicon ICs bring many new potential market applications previously unattainable with conventional technology. FlexICs that are visually unobtrusive are ideal for integration onto goods packaging, controlled documents, and others. During Phase 1, we validated the market potential for our FlexICs. A conservative estimate shows a demand for 800bn FlexICs p/a, which is a fraction of the full 40trillion p/a potential.  In order to facilitate this demand, we want to enable localised FlexIC production capacity for packagers, integrators and component manufacturers for immediate integration into end-products. Our solution is to develop a ‘factory-in-a-box’; a self-contained, modular and autonomous production facility containing all of our novel processes. This FlexLogIC plant will deliver the FlexICs required cost effectively at market accepted price levels. We have strong documented need and demand pull from market leading companies such as Crown Packaging, Cartamundi, Molex and SMARTRAC and others for an integrated solution such as FlexLogIC.  Within 2 years, we will develop an entry-level module (ELMo) with capacity to produce upto 800m FlexICs p/a. The 5-year forecasts conservatively show a net cash inflow of €63.1m (mostly from license fees) by 2022 with an ROI of 47%. We are currently the only Company with the capability to supply an autonomous facility for high-volume manufacture of FlexICs.",0,0
931,206786,No,Intellectual Property Right Dashboard,"According to a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) analysis, Europe risks losing the leadership in innovations. To protect innovations/inventions and to ensure the return on investment, intellectual property rights (IPR) are increasingly used. IPR processes are very complex, cost intensive and time consuming. Due to these facts, especially innovative entities (companies and universities) require very high efficient IPR management systems, which have not been existed on the market until now. The objective of EZN’s proposed innovation project “IProBoard – Intellectual Property Right Dashboard” is a business model, that contains a new service system, allowing the first time an efficient and individual IPR support for customer needs to significantly save efforts and costs and to simplify the sophisticated IPR management. The IPR data flood is reduced by IProBoard to an extract, which handles the main IPR figures in “one picture” (like a dashboard in a car) and allows a policy makers to decide intuitively in a very short time to realise maximised protection in combination with minimized costs.  Each IPR can be managed by using IProBoard. Thus, the global potential market volume for IProBoard is up to hundreds of million Euro in an international field. Potential customers are all inventors, patent applicants and holders world-wide – preferentially hundreds of thousands of SME and additionally large enterprises and universities. First institutions have shown clear signals to EZN to purchase IProBoard, these are especially five German universities from Hannover, Brunswick, Clausthal and Berlin. So, IProBoard is very close to market and first sales (> 1.2 Mio Euro) are already possible with the market launch. IProBoard is developed by EZN due to the 35-year long term experience in the field of IPR. To exploit IProBoard, the main objectives for this feasibility study are evaluation of technical, economic and operational feasibility, schedule and the elaboration of a business plan.",0,0

The LIPSE consortium consists of leading institutions in 11 European countries.  Seven empirical cross-national work packages will collect new insights on five building blocks of social innovation in the public sector: 1. Innovation environments 2. Innovation inputs 3. Innovation tools and processes 4. Innovation outcomes, diffusion and upscaling 5. Feedback loops in innovative systems  The project will firstly map institutional environments to study the role of social capital, innovation champions and leadership, using survey research and social network analysis.  The project will then look at citizens’ inputs into public innovation processes through participation, complaints and co-creation. This will be achieved by a) analysing secondary administrative datasets from ombudsmen and national audit offices b) case studies in social and welfare services and urban and rural regeneration and c) large scale survey research. It will then examine the use of risk management in innovation processes.  A work package on innovation diffusion and adoption will assess what factors contribute to the successful upscaling of ICT-driven social innovations, with a focus on teleworking (as a new way of working) and e-procurement.

124,79836,Yes,Intelligent Logistics for Innovative Product Technologies,"It is apparent that the current business model in the automotive industry, of the mass-production of identical products, is flawed and becoming dysfunctional. The industry suffers from global over-capacity and rising stock levels in the market and exhibits inherently low profitability. The automotive industry is a major contributor to prosperity throughout the Member States, reinforcing the imperative for research and validation of an alternative and innovative approach, in order to secure its benefits for the next generation.  ILIPT will address the conceptual and practical aspects of the delivery to the customer of a bespoke product only several days after placing the order, the automotive industry's exciting and radical new business model. The remaining work, on realising the opportunities for new materials and processes, and on validating designs with hardware, can then be proposed and undertaken with confidence.   The project represents a radical leap for the European automotive industry from the 'stock push' and 'mass production' thinking of the last century to a stockless 'build-to-order' (BTO) production strategy. This will require re-invention of the complete automotive value stream from material producers to end consumers of cars, through a cost optimised system delivering what the customer really wants without delay.Within the full framework of the 'EU 5-Day Car Initiative', the Integrated Project 'Intelligent Logistics for Innovative Product Technologies' focuses on the following.  First, the product configuration for build-to-order supply chains addressing new product technologies with the tools and management methods. Second, new concepts in delivering flexible production networks addressing collaboration across complete value streams and interoperability of these processes.

614,71382,No,Cross-Organisational Workflow Formation and Enactment,"Achieving sustainable growth and improving competitiveness in increasingly complex and dynamic market environments requires businesses to build agile partnerships and alliances. Market demands can only be satisfied within dynamic networks of collaborating organisations. True collaboration inside such networks requires tight but flexible integration of business processes. In CrossWork we focus on distributed, cross-organisational development processes in the automotive industry, forming Networks of Automotive Excellence (NoAE).  The main project objective is the development of mechanisms for automated workflow formation and enactment, enabling NoAE. Our technological approach is based on Multiagent Systems (MAS), introducing the paradigm of distributed and decentralised decision making in Workflow Management Systems (WfMS). In contrast to state-of-the-art WfMS we avoid statically linked workflows, but let workflows form dynamically. The flexible mechanisms of CrossWork also handle exceptions during the enactment phase, resulting in dynamic workflow adaptations. To facilitate automated share and exchange of information across organisational boundaries we will develop a machine-readable representation of domain and workflow knowledge (an ontology).  A novel enterprise modelling framework, supporting the automated formation of cross-organisational workflow models, will result in less effort for development, maintenance and adaptation of enterprise models, which is of specific interest for SMEs. Automatically generated user interfaces will allow users to acquire hands- on-experience which leads to improved local workflow models. Our business objectives are improved overall process quality (through enabling selection and integration of best- of-class network partners), reduced transaction costs and information flow-time (due to fast and effective integration of network partners), and improved flexibility with an open platform architecture and exception handling mechanisms.",0,0

Mobile multimedia services will generate an estimated incremental annual revenue of 5000 MECU per annum by 2005 for a broad range of players. New employment opportunities will be created in equipment and terminal manufacturing, media content supply and manipulation, and network service provision. The availability of information services through wireless networks will assist the development of teleworking, and therefore will have a favourable impact on employment, transportation patterns and the environment.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables The technical feasibility and business viability of wireless communications for the distribution of advanced multimedia products. A client-server platform was developed and tested in end-user trials in 3 existing GSM networks in Europe, as well as a high speed 2G\ GSM demonstrator (HSCSD) in a laboratory environment. Contribution to the programme The complete business chain from content creation to delivery and secure payment was developed and trialed, demonstrating the 'business -case' for mobile multimedia communications. Technical Approach Based on the studies of user requirements, service platform architectures, compression and presentation technologies, a client-server based service platform will be implemented and tested in genuine end-user trials. The APIs for the service feeding and electronic payment functions will be included in the implementation. System enhancements will be developed and demonstrated in the Technical Demonstrator to assess the benefits of wider band user channels and determine how they can be incorporated into UMTS.  The following new technologies will be investigated and applied in the project: presentation technologies, optimised for the inherently narrowband cellular user channels for optimal server connectivity, an enhanced direct LAN access solution allowing the distribution platform to access the wireless network on a LAN-to-LAN basis electronic payment techniques allowing automatic charging for information downloaded by the user with minimum financial overhead wide band user channels allowing transmission rates of the third generation mobile systems (n x 9600 bit/s, n >= 2). Summary of Trial Genuine end-user trials will conducted in parallel in three different countries on a commercial-like basis using operational personal telecommunications networks and clearing/interchange networks. These will allow the realistic assessment of wireless multimedia services and verification of the identified business opportunities. Two different strategies for media content provisioning will be employed. One is based on adjusting the existing information feed as necessary to allow the automatic loading of the media server with content. The other is based on genuine editing of media content in the same way as a publication would be edited.  During the service trials all necessary data will be collected to allow a comprehensive analysis including an examination of user acceptance of the selected applications, a technical and commercial assessment, and the preparation of the business plans.

152,211252,Yes,Additive Micro-Manufacturing for Plastic Micro-flectro-Mechanical-Systems,"The manufacturing of silicon-based MEMS today is well advanced because the micro-electro-mechanical devices for automotive, domestic, health-care and consumer electronics can be fabricated with methods from IC industry. Polymer-based MEMS have a great potential for flexible electronics and biomedical applications, but to date, the techniques to engineer functional polymers into 3D microsystems, are still at their beginning because a coherent fabrication platform with the right tools and processes does not yet exist. The field could tremendously benefit from a coordinated effort in materials and manufacturing, in particular with a focus on biocompatible plastic materials for biomedical applications. Additive manufacturing such as 3D printing and associated processing such as sintering has already started to transform traditional industry, but is not scalable much below a micrometer because the thermal processing is done in bulk or by lasers on surfaces. MEMS 4.0, in analogy with the industry 4.0 concept, aims to perform concerted research in additive manufacturing at the micro/nanoscale and associated key techniques. Using my expertise in MEMS and Nanotechnology, MEMS 4.0 will push the frontiers in new materials and new processing for MEMS by setting a focus on stencilling, printing, self-assembly and local thermal processing. This coherent processing framework will permit the use of delicate, soft, polymer materials to engineer the next generations of plastic MEMS.

22,208291,Yes,Networking for innovation: how entrepreneurs' network behaviours help clusters to innovate,"In recent years, economic geography has strongly embraced the relational approach: entrepreneurs striving to generate innovations have been shown to benefit from embeddedness in local, cohesive networks if these are combined with connectivity to sparse, global ties that bring diversity. With this heightened importance of networks for innovation, it is rather surprising that academic research has nearly entirely overlooked the role of “networking”. Networks are portrayed as if they are formed exclusively through latent preferences to connect with certain people or through contextual factors that make people accidently connect. This leaves little space for entrepreneurs’ deliberate attempts to create the social capital they believe will help them innovate. We thus lack the micro-level theoretical foundations of the network-innovation relationship in economic geography. My research aims to build these foundations by developing a network behavioural approach to innovation in entrepreneurial clusters. I seek to investigate how within-cluster variation in entrepreneurs’ innovation performance may originate in differences in network behaviour and how between-cluster variation in performance may originate in the spread of effective network behaviours within but not between clusters. Answers to these questions should lead to fundamentally new insights into why certain clusters thrive as hubs of innovation and why certain entrepreneurs within clusters contribute more to the innovation in clusters than others. I will collect granular qualitative and quantitative data of the network behaviours of entrepreneurs through interviews, multi-wave surveys and online network monitoring tools to unveil how they decide which ties to build and which ones to call on in specific situations. I will then assess how these behaviours enable or constrain entrepreneurs and, in aggregate, clusters to innovate using large-scale econometric analyses as well social science experiments.",0,1
136,44839,Yes,"In-situ technique for innovative reliability assessment of advanced, high density electrical interconnection","Impact on predictive capability: -The in-situ technique is by far more effective than the conventional to point out the specific failure mode induced by the stress. This was clearly demonstrated in the case of the leakage tests done on underfilled flip chip assemblies: conventional off-line measurement apparently did not show failures, whereas the in-situ technique recorded erratic spikes of the current leakage outside the target limits; -The behavior expected at the beginning of the project, i.e. a drift according to a continuous curves relative to only 1 aging mechanism, following the law 'the higher the drift, the shorter the time to failure' has been checked only for one test structure (Ag- filled polymer via in thermal cycle test); -The in-situ method gives an accurate monitoring of the resistance of connections during aging. In this way, it gives better information on the aging than the conventional tests. Example: the in-situ test method gives in hot storage an image of the materials evolution for soldered interconnections (CSP/BGA).  Impact on throughput time: -The higher measuring resolution allows to select more stringent failure criteria compared to conventional testing. For flip chip assemblies in T-shock test, it was shown that by bringing down the failure criterion from 1W to a drift of 50%, the throughput time can be reduced with a factor 2 to 6; -For embedded resistors in the IMEC 1 technology, change of performance could be shown accurately by the insitu technique. Thus, under well known stresses, it is possible to determine the resistor drift. That is to say, the moment when the device is going out of specifications; -For adhesive interconnections we clearly see a post-cure effect during the insitu tests at high stress levels. This means that during accelerated tests at high stress levels, we measure the intrinsic robustness of the interconnections and not the actual quality. If stress in the field does not induce the post-cure effect, life testing should be done at lower stress levels, closer to the field conditions. This is only posible with insitu testing with high measuring resolution; - Statistical relevance; -Prototypes of test systems have been made available allowing 256 channels to be tested in one run. This allows proper statistical analysis of the results.  Applicable to high density interconnections: -The test structures selected in this project clearly demonstrate that the insitu approach is very well suited for advanced, high density interconnections; -Generally speaking, the in-situ tool becomes very interesting when the aging mechanisms /failure modes are clearly known and understood. Thus, this opens the way to short and efficient testing. Compared to conventional accelerated testing, it gives more accurate and more reliable measurements because it prevents from any disturbance due to external factors and ensures that the testing conditions will not change; -Potential application areas of the in-situ technique are: -Automation of accelerated testing; -Determination of aging mechanisms for new technologies; -Comparison of new batches of materials in a short test; -SPC; -The ITERELCO project revealed also some limitations of the approach. Suggestions for improvement and a guideline how to use in-situ technique were formulated. Portable products and products for harsh environments are the booming markets for the electronic equipment sector. As a consequence, the electronics industry is confronted with ever increasing functionality and integration on single chips, reducing size, greater power, reduced weight and higher temperature applications. Therefore, new advanced electrical input/output (I/O) interconnection technologies and materials at the packaging level are continuously being developed and have to be proved. One of the majorchallenges in the development of new advanced electrical I/O interconnect technologies at the packaging level, is to evaluate, optimise and qualify their reliability. The reliability of electrical I/O's is one of the major concerns of the electronic packaging industry. A major difficulty encountered today is that for new interconnection techniques, the aging kinetics are not known and that the reliability qualification time using conventional techniques is too long, with a negative influence on the time to market of the product.  In the ITERELCO project, new reliability evaluation techniques for electrical I/O interconnects will be developed and validated. These new techniques should meet the following demands: a) short testing time (in the order of 100hours) b) high sensitivity to the major ageing mechanisms of electrical I/O'sc) high predictive capability for real life performance In the validation phase of the project, the correlation between conventional test results and results obtained with the new techniques will be studied. Therefore, the reliability of a number of selected advanced interconnect technologies (e.g. flip chip with an isotropic and isotropic adhesives and polymer stud grid arrays) will be fully evaluated, both with conventional and innovative techniques. For this purpose, a Consortium has been formed, consisting of three end-users in the packaging industry in complementary application fields, a reliability test system manufacturer to provide prototypes, and two research centres specialised in the field of reliability in electronic packaging. Only Consortia like this can eventually ascertain the competitiveness of the European industry in the exploding markets of portable products and products for harsh environment. BE97-4914",0,1

This requires data-input and output devices representing a great number of physical parameters further than image and audio. Such devices monitor kinaesthetic and haptic data such as motion, force etc. - Operational Goals -  Prototype integration of:  Interfaces for the Telepresence user: 1. Helmet-type screen for immersive visual representation, including inertial data monitoring, featuring: stereo view of a remote scene (through remote camera input) Competitive equipment cost. 2. A force-reflecting exoskeleton glove/arm display, featuring: force-reflecting multi-finger glove force-reflecting arm exoskeleton optimised stiffness for best mechanical response bandwidth optimisation for communications low basic component cost 3. An inertial coupled active seat, featuring: motorised motion motion control hardware/software for elevated mechanical response low basic component cost  Remote robotics devices: 1. Industrial applications: A dextrous robot manipulator for: high precision arm / hand for force-reflecting manipulation force reflecting 'leg'-motion for operation of driving pedals bandwidth optimisation for operation using ATM based communications. Expected Impact The massive proliferation of the personal computer use, combined with the communication network expansion, opens the way to a great number of multimedia-based tele-operations, such as tele-shopping, tele-payment, mail access, image and sound communication for conferencing etc. While one multimedia trend is focusing towards this type of data-exchanges, telepresence systems support the opening of more 'active' applications such as remote presence for tele-working, tele-attendance, tele-operation for equipment etc. This approach responds to one of the central aims of the European telecommunications development for the establishment of new flexibilities in the employment market. High performance telepresence may open the possibilities for teleworking in industrial sectors ('blue-collar teleworking'), requiring equipment driving or guidance (such as material handling, part assembling etc.) or in sectors involving unpleasant working conditions (heat, dust, chemical pollution etc.). The possibility of machine guidance through tele-manipulation of machine driving panels opens an extremely wide range of applications from chemical industry to civil works. The impact on working conditions for the users may be enormous. Additionally, the implementation of flexible working schemes may also become much easier, opening the way for employment opportunities. Telepresence peripherals (helmet screens, force-reflecting gloves etc.) may become standard educational tools in the near future. Using such devices, students may be able to perform 'hands-on' experiences in virtual 'didactic' environments from mechanics, atom-scale chemistry etc. The market for educational computing is huge and rapidly expanding. IDC, the market research company in UK, estimates the British market for educational computers and software at ECU 724 million per year. The school market for computer equipment and software services represents only 4% of the overall British computer market, but is growing at a rapid 8 % a year.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Tele-presence system which allows users to 'handle' objects in remote environments Contribution to the programme The system opens up  possibilities for extending the benefits of teleworking to blue-collar teleworkers who have to operate equipment in unpleasant or dangerous working conditions  Technical Approach The project initially deals with the development of low cost, bandwidth optimised data-input devices which will include kinaesthetic and force-reflecting functions. These are 'data-gloves' 'data-arms' with force-feedback sense, helmet type screens with head orientation sensors as well as active seats for over-all body dynamics monitoring. In parallel, adequate data-output devices will be developed to serve as 'physical supports' for the remote user. They will include dual camera mountings and manipulators, performing head-eye coordination, hand-eye coordination etc. Their numbers of degrees of freedom and force-exerting capacities will depend on the particular application.  A 'high end' industrial version of such input and output devices will be integrated and validated. Summary of Trial In the industrial sector a remote user will operate precise tele-manipulation including head-eye co-ordination, hand-eye co-ordination, arm/hand motion for grasping, as well as lower limb action on driving pedals. The trials will include: Telepresence in a remote industrial environment using ATM communications including mobility in an area, manipulation of objects, inspection of selected items, surveillance etc. Telepresence in remote utility machine operation using ATM communications including machine panel instrumentation handling, sensation of machine motion, material tele-handling etc. Key Issues 1.

For the proposed project a number specific electronic commerce objects and added-value demonstration scenarios will be tested for SME acceptance:  - Search strategies for Products and Services  - Post Sales Service  - Training and Education  - On-line-Consulting   These scenarios will also be evaluated in conjunction with the GEN-testbed of the G7-Pilotproject 'Global market place for Small and Medium sized Enterprises', part of the G7 Global Information Society Initiative. The baseline of the proposed scenarios is provided by existing projects, both commercially and publicly funded. The major technical thrust of the project is the integration of technologies identified and their transfer to SMEs, thus enabling them to act as virtual company. Consequently the core effort of the project is directed to the exploitation and demonstration of innovative value-added-service technologies for Electronic Commerce for small and medium sized enterprises. Presently there is an ongoing networking of the major SME organisations under way, in particular the networks of CCIs and their Associations, for instance in Germany (DIHT) or with the international G7-SME network which are in the process to connect large numbers of SMEs. The project aims to exploit this ongoing process as well, such that it provides a value added communication infrastructure with a growing variety of services such as company information, business partners on the domestic market and on international markets, access to technical and commercial databases.   A second phase of the project is designed to test and evaluate easy and cost-effective access to the proposed GEN value added services. This analysis aims to identify and verify the required access and service products for SMEs and to show also where shortcomings continue to be present. The overall project cycle of AGENT-ISME is designed to verify all useful instruments for ELECTRONIC COMMERCE in the GEN context and it includes besides the capabilities of INTERNET and WWW also the use of integrated EDI services for SMEs.   Another area of service integration are solutions for tele-co-operation. Besides information services supplied by the CCIs , truly interactive tele-working and tele-co-operation services will empower SMEs to conduct electronic commerce business processes effectively. In particular those solutions are supplied by varoius related external technology projects and they will be exploited by AGENT-ISME.   Many SMEs still have no or limited experience in electronic commerce with regards to the integration of information/knowledge exchange technology in product design and manufacturing business processes. Often their knowledge about these processes is rather diffused. Thus for the transfer AGENT-ISME results to SMEs a well targeted GEN-oriented awareness strategy will be developed, for a technology that is new terrain for SMEs and which includes besides active PR work and information a variety of specialised workshops and training seminars. The project partners will have varying infrastructures and access to networks at the time of submission of the proposal. The results of AGENT-ISME are designed to be placed on a network of WWW-servers in order to be widely accessible as early as possible.",0,1
275,96129,No,Free-Space Optical Systems for Next Generation Communication Networks,"Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a license-free access technology with high-bandwidth capacity. It is a powerful alternative and/or complementary solution to commonly deployed fiber optic and wireless radio-frequency links. FSO is appealing for a number of applications including metropolitan area network extensions, enterprise/campus network connectivity, fiber back-up, back-haul for wireless cellular networks, disaster recovery, and quantum key distribution among others. Despite the major advantages of FSO technology and variety of its application areas, its widespread use has been hampered by its rather disappointing performance for long-range links. The major performance limiting factor for FSO links with ranges longer than one kilometer is the atmospheric turbulence-induced fading. Building upon the concept of cooperative diversity, the proposed research will devise efficient physical layer solutions tailored for the inherent characteristics of the FSO channel that remedy the shortcomings of existing systems. The proposed systems and techniques will provide a novel research framework on the design and analysis of relay-assisted (cooperative) FSO transmission. The results of this proposed research will be instrumental in the building of long-range, highly reliable, and ultra-fast FSO systems to meet the demanding requirements of next generation communication networks. This proposal is in fact a natural continuation of the applicant Dr. Uysal’s internationally renowned research program on FSO communication which he has carried out at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant, if funded, will help Dr. Uysal transfer this internationally visible research program to Europe.",0,0

562,80474,No,Europe-China Grid Internetworking,"The Internet communication infrastructure (the TCP/IP protocol stack) is designed for broad use; as such, it does not take the specific characteristics of Grid applications into account. This one-size-fits-all approach works for a number of application domains, however, it is far from being optimal - general network mechanisms, while useful for the Grid, cannot be as efficient as customised solutions. While the Grid is slowly emerging, its network infrastructure is still in its infancy. Thus, based on a number of properties that make Grids unique from the network perspective, the project EC-GIN (Europe-China Grid InterNetworking) will develop tailored network technology in dedicated support of Grid applications.  These technical solutions will be supplemented with a secure and incentive-based Grid Services network traffic management system, which will balance the conflicting performance demand and the economic use of resources in the network and within the Grid.By collaboration between European and Chinese partners, EC-GIN parallels previous efforts for real-time multimedia transmission across the Internet: much like the Grid, these applications have special network requirements and show a special behaviour from the network perspective.  However, while research into network support for multimedia applications has flourished, leading to a large number of standard protocols and mechanisms, the research community has neglected network support for Grid computing up to now. By filling this gap and appropriately exploiting / disseminating the project results, EC-GIN will, therefore, cause a 'snowball effect' in the European and Chinese networking and Grid computing research communities.  Technically, EC-GIN will make the Grid work, operate, and communicate better. By appropriately utilising the underlying network, Grid resources in general will be used more efficiently and amplify the impact of Grid computing on the society and economy of Europe and China.",0,0

THE PARTICULAR INTEREST OF THE DUBLIN GROUP LIES IN THE GENETIC CONTROL SITES OF THE GENES WHICH MEDIATE SWITCHES IN CARBON METABOLISM, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO UNDERSTAND THE SHIFTS IN METABOLIC ACTIVITIES OCCURING IN YEASTS.  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as an efficient agent to ferment sugary liquids to alcoholic beverages and, more recently, to ethanol as a fuel for motor vehicles. The enzymes involved in the glycolysis account for 50% of the total cell protein. Research was carried out in order to identify the genes coding for factors which are required to enhance the synthesis of elevated levels of those enzymes which increase when yeast cells are exposed to fermentable sugars. This involved the isolation and characterization of those genes and their products which sense the availability of sugars, transmit a signal to the regulatory circuits which specifically activate transcription, translation and maturation of glycolytic enzymes. Mutants were isolated, genes cloned, sequenced, deleted and overexpressed. Direct mutagenesis in vitro was used to identify control regions of such genes and binding proteins. Overexpression of genes coding for different glycolytic enzymes was used to identify possible catalytic bottlenecks in glycolysis.  Pyruvate decarboxylase was used as an indicator enzyme to study the regulation of glycolytic enzymes. A second structural gene PDC5 was found and shown to have great sequence similarity with PDC1 in the coding but not in the flanking 5 prime regions and 3 prime regions. PDC5 is only transcribed when PDC1 is deleted. PDC1 codes for all enzyme activity in wild type. When active, PDC5 promotes the formation of pyruvate decarboxylase at 80% the level of PDC1. Deletion analysis of the 5 prime region of PDC1 identified a sequence required for glucose induction of enzyme formation and a second region with repressing effects. Transcription activation factors were identified by protein deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding assays. A new gene, PDC3, was identified as necessary for pyruvate decarboxylase formation at the posttranscriptional level. Induction of pyruvate decarboxylase requires the function of gene BYP1 involved in transducing a glucose triggered cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal. THE REGULATION OF FLOW CARBON THROUGH THE FERMENTATIVE AND RESPIRATORY PATHWAYS OF YEAST INVOLVES CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF EXPRESSION OF A NUMBER OF GENES WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECT THE METABOLISM OF PYRUVATE, INCLUDING PDCI (THE STRUCTURAL GENE FOR PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE), PDC2 AND PDC3 (REGULATORY GENES FOR PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE).

It’s a problem that affects the richest countries and developing countries alike, and the possible solutions are as slow to put in place as they are difficult to enforce. Moreover, the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. These facts highlight the need of efficient and environmentally sustainable urban mobility services that do not generate CO2 emissions and ease traffic congestion.  Within this context, an innovative service has been developed in order to solve mobility problems in the city of Barcelona and potentially major metropolitan areas in Europe. MOTIT is a unique and innovative electric scooter sharing service, in which users may pick up and drop off vehicles wherever and whenever they want. MOTIT allows users to reserve a scooter with their smartphone, and some minutes before the start of the trip he receives a notification on his smartphone with the position of the vehicle assigned.  Vehicle positioning performance is key for the success of the service, since the user is informed on where to pick up his vehicle based on this source.

113,73987,Yes,Solar Steam Reforming of Methane Rich Gas for Synthesis Gas Production (SOLREF),"Methane reforming is an endothermic reaction between methane, steam and/or CO2. The products are a mixture of hydrogen and CO, called syngas. In solar reforming, the calorific value of the fuel is upgraded by 20-30%, accounted for the contribution of the solar energy. The products can be directly combusted in a gas turbine for electricity generation or, can be used as a source for hydrogen production. The process is attractive where the sun is plentiful and where natural gas is available close by (e.g. Italy). The products can be piped in the existing pipeline and can be used as a fuel by customers far from the solar plant. Solar reforming can also be applied to other methane containing feedstocks such as biogas, and CO2 contaminated wells. This makes solar reforming a powerful candidate for benign, pollution free fuel processing in the future hydrogen economy. In the framework of the EC/FP4 the fundamentals of this technology have been developed (SOLASYS project) and tested at a scale of few hundreds kilowatts solar input. Based on the results of the SOLASYS project, the SOLREF project aims to bring the technology forward to the edge of industrialisation.

Expected results  Definition of an innovative, TMN-compatible information model for the operation and management of photonic networks, both at the network and network element levels, that ensures transversal compatibility;  Development of management application prototypes for TMN agents and managers and demonstration on a WDM optical network testbed;  Implementation and demonstration of fully managed, transparent WDM optical networks.  Contribution to international standards on WDM network management.  Expected impact  Assessment of technologies that enable industrial software and hardware developers to implement manageable optical networks, including interworking of management platforms for the optical and electrical core networks and nodes;  A significant contribution to the formation of a consensus view for innovative operation and management of the future European WDM optical network infrastructure.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Applied the principals of network management (TMN) to advanced all-optical networks involving WDM. Contribution to the programme Practical contribution to the deployment of fully-managed, fully transparent optical networks. Technical approach The project will first examine and identify the optical network elements and functional blocks, the specific optical functionalities and the related optical parameters, which need to be controlled and monitored to support TMN operation and management of optical networks. These parameters will be defined, including the level at which the corresponding control information must be made available and processed, and an appropriate set of managed objects with attributes and behaviour will be developed. The project will apply simultaneously bottom-up (requirements from the optical layer) and top-down (network level) specification approaches, so as to allow a generic approach for control and management of photonic networks, independent of the internal architectures and technologies of the various optical network elements. The corresponding set of specifications will be issued, applying innovative methodological approaches recommended by both ITU-T and ETSI.   Management software applications (agents and managers) will be developed according to the defined information model, in order to provide configuration, fault and performance services. New agents will be developed for the network elements, including both a management software interface with real-time control software for the hardware prototype, and a management software interface for the software emulation platform. The manager development will start on the basis of existing prototypes of SDH managers, which will be upgraded with new modules suited for optical WDM core networks. Finally, test of the whole management system composed of the managers and their platforms, the software emulation platform and the hardware prototype will be done using the same Q interface and the suited agents, to ensure full interoperability of the applications with the testbeds. Summary of trials The management software applications (fault, configuration/restoration and performance services) will be tested and demonstrated on two different testbeds :  An emulation software platform for WDM optical networks, capable of emulating different topologies and network elements, will be used to demonstrate the full range of management functionalities and services;  A rack-mounted prototype of a WDM optical ring network, made of optical amplifiers and three reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers, will be upgraded to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the defined information model, of the selected optical functionalities and of the novel management applications.  Key issues The generic, application-oriented approach of the MEPHISTO project for the management of all-optical core networks will address:  the definition of a generic information model for photonic networks ensuring compatibility with TMN principles and with requirements of advanced optical technology;  the impact of technology requirements on the management system, both in terms of software applications and software/hardware interfaces;  the relationship of management agents, managers and operations systems for optical core networks and network elements, including the interworking of management platforms and the cross-management with the electrical layer;  the formation of a consensus view and contributions to international standardisation bodies and forums on control and management of optical networks.",0,0

The deliverables are a Geographic Information System to support mine action and a Decision Support System.  Maintenance of EU mine Action web-site.  Output Indicators and Impact  The expected results from this project relate to the provision of supporting data contributing to the support to further development, and evaluation, conducted at an European level on sensors and systems for demining. It provides information and management tools specifically aimed to improve planning and execution of demining action.  From the above deliverables a number may be highlighted specifically: - Contribution to the further development of a common methodology to identify the needs of mine affected areas; - Application of the Statements of Needs and demining information to improve the focus of European R&D into demining sensors; - Support to the co-ordination of international R&D activity and the provision of common test standards; - Support to the optimisation of demining systems through development and application of objective standards; - Provision of test facilities - in the frame of an international collaborative action, together with the above actions - to facitite evaluation; This should lead to tools capable of improving the safety and cost effectiveness of the demining process to the benefit of mine action programmes; - Initial scientific investigation of the potential benefit of airborne/space borne survey with potential to improve the planning process of mine action. Summary of the project  The JRC focuses its project on the following key functions: - Impartial technological advice and support to DG RELEX, DG AIDCO and the services of the Commission involved in humanitarian demining and co-ordinated in the Commission's Mine Action Co-ordination Group (MACG); - Support as specified in the International Test and Evaluation Program (ITEP) MoU; including co-ordination, execution, test and evaluation of tools; - Support to the development of improved tools for minefield survey and mine detection as requested by the 'Regulation' of 23rd July 2001; - Support the validation and exploitation of results from projects supported by DG INFSO during FP4/FP5; - Development of standards for test and evaluation in the context of humanitarian demining.  Rationale  This work plan is based on the preamble to the regulation (EC) No 1724/2001 of the European Parliament and Council of 23 July 2001 which states at paragraph (11), 'Scientific research should be intensified with the aim of developing technologies to facilitate mine detection and identification of the affected areas with greater precision.'  In support of this requirement, JRC is fully committed to helping DG RELEX achieve better visibility, transparency and efficiency in EU mine actions and supporting DG INFSO's efforts to deliver better technology.  There are many stakeholders involved in mine actions. JRC helps the EU to provide a coherent contribution that fits in with the global effort. To achieve this, JRC is also working with other organisations - particularly the United Nations, the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, Mine Action Centres in afflicted countries, NGOs, as well as other demining organisations and industry developing improved tools.",0,0
547,34572,No,Integrated Automated Process Planning System,"Objectives and content   This proposal is based on the user requirements having been obtained on consensus during the pilot phase of the AIT Initiative (EP7704). This initiative aims to push forward the competitiveness of European Industry in Design and Manufacturing processes in key industrial sectors through the appropriate integration of Information Technology.   Process planning has been identified by the AIT Pilot phase to be a complex, important domain of the manufacturing engineering business process. Hence the application of up-to-date computer support has the potential to provide substantial improvement. resulting in better quality process plans with less effort of resources and in 3 shorter time.   The development and validation of an integrated, automated process planning system will be the key 10 tap this source of rationalisation. Important elements to be covered by this activities are:   - the full integration with adjacent systems like Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP),  - the capabiliy to learn by applying achieved results to similar new tasks, - the extensive utilisation of the services of the AIT Information Technology Reference Model (1TRM).   Particularly the complementing AIT-activities towards feature-based product modelling (with the product definition accessable in STEP format) can only be fully exploited, when equivalent procedures are applied for transforming these product data into the manufacturing model. describing the suitable processes and other more detailed information of their performance. The close co-ordination of these two related fields of activities (beyond the regular AIT co-ordination) will be safeguarded through the joint project co-ordinator AEG. Due to the more IT-dominated nature of the feature-based modelling, that proposal will be submitted against the appropriate task (liM 8.2) of the ESPRIT workprogramme.",0,0
357,111565,No,Development of a new Bio-Composite from renewable resources with improved thermal and fire resistance for manufacturing a truck internal part with high quality surface finishing,"'The main objective of NATURTRUCK is to develop injected plastic parts for the commercial vehicles industry (mainly cabin truck parts) made with thermoplastic composite materials from renewable resources (at least 80%  w/w), namely physically modified polylactic acid (PLA) grades and natural fibres, with improved thermal and flame retardancy properties and high quality surface finishing to be used in truck internal parts as a real alternative to low-gloss standard ABS grades  at a competitive cost.  By achieving the challenging NATURTRUCK objectives, the availability of PLA with improved properties and optimised production process will allow NATURTRUCK SME’s partners, and consequently the EU industry, to fabricate new thermoplastic biocomposite products suitable to satisfy the commercial vehicles manufacture sector stringent mechanical, thermal, fire resistance and eco-friendliness requirements, at a cost comparable to current ABS price, increasing their differentiation from competitors and creating significant market opportunities. The main innovation of NATURTRUCK in comparison with previous projectsis the possibility to tailor the properties of commercial PLA grades by a synergic combination of different types of additives and reinforcements (radiation susceptors, chain extenders, flame retardants and natural fibres) and post-annealing techniques based on non-conventional high frequency energy sources.  This challenge makes NATURTRUCK a real 'beyond of the estate of art' project, due to the smart combination of technologies and materials employed, which will permit for instance to increase the rate and percentage of the crystalline phase in the PLA biocomposite and in consequence to increase its thermal resistance and mechanical properties.'",0,0

46,32000,Yes,Integrated Contaminated Sites Management,"COSIMA will develop an integrated telematics system for environmental and planning experts to identify and cope with land sites thought to be contaminated by previous industrial use. After determining the nature and scale of contamination, site remedial action may be needed to restore safety. COSIMA will agree a common approach, developing a system with graphics and text to test data and procedures for cleaning up sites and advising prospective users of the land. The final system will be a user-friendly map-based tool contributing to economic environmentally sound urban development throughout Europe.  The COSIMA consortium comprises five cities: Cologne (DE), Cork (IE), Bologna (IT), Amsterdam (NL) and Katowice (PL). In addition three software development firms are involved: ESBI, strässle, and ESRI Italia. This group will develop a computerised Integrated Contaminated Sites Management Support System (CSMSS) to assist experts in planning, environment and other fields in remediating, assessing, registering and reinstating sites which may have been contaminated through previous use, for example, for industrial or landfill purposes. Sites must be investigated to assess the nature and extent of contamination and the effort and resources required to make them safe and suitable for further use. COSIMA will agree a common approach for the investigation, analysis and reinstatement of contaminated sites, and will develop and implement an appropriate support and analysis system on the basis of three different Geographic Information Systems (GIS): ArcInfo, Intergraph and GRADIS-GIS. The system will hold graphics for maps, photographs, etc, and text on procedures for testing and analysis, methods of remediation, results obtained and cross-references to standards for investigation, clean-up and re-use of sites. It will assist users by analysing sites and suggesting methods and levels of reinstatement, linking into existing computer record and analysis facilities in the cities. Common interfaces, data handling methods, reports and graphic presentation will make CSMSS appear and function the same in all participating cities. The final system will be a standardised, user-friendly, map-based tool to support contaminated sites management. It will promote economic, environmentally sound development of cities through comprehensive and speedy analysis and processing of sites, and, being standardised, it will facilitate cooperation and development Europe-wide.   Major Validation Sites Stadt Köln, Amt für Umweltschutz, Köln, DE Cork Corporation, Environmental Unit, Cork, IE  Users  The COSIMA consortium is led by cities in their capacity as telematics users. The expert staff from the local authorities in charge of contaminated sites management will define the requirements for the entire technical task, which will be carried out by the industry partners, and will verify the results.

269,219089,No,Federating European Electronics Ecosystems for Competitive Electronics Industries,"In view of the fierce global competition, decision makers in Europe acknowledge challenges that the electronics industry faces. The launch of large-scale investments and support measures to drive innovation, such as ECSEL, PENTA, IPCEI, are an important step in strengthening this key sector of the economy. Europe needs to define long-term visions and strategies for the whole European electronics industry in order to keep its competitive edge and foster value creation. A major contribution is currently ongoing with the revision of the EC strategy on electronics, which will be taken into account in the proposed project. At the same time, digitisation of industry and society is a megatrend that urgently requires electronics as the hardware building blocks complementing and interacting with other areas like software, communications, computing, robotics and photonics. 5E will underpin digitisation, and support specifically the electronics industry in seizing opportunities by federating – not merging – the 3 European electronics ecosystems. Federation will be achieved by developing a joint vision based on the state of play and focusing on interfaces, as well as on opportunities for collaboration and cross-fertilisation. A technology and application meta-roadmap will be elaborated and implemented in the 3 electronics areas, in application sectors, in the areas of digitisation, as well as on the European and regional policy levels. Dedicated actions will further reinforce cooperation and outreach across Europe - in all relevant value chains, sectors, areas and target groups – and at the international level. Targeted actions reach out to EU projects, large industry, SMEs, start-ups, demand-side, users and wider public, and include a toolbox, digital library and showcase as well as a contest. 7 influential partners with deep technological and methodological expertise join forces and are supported by 37 Associated Partners (industry, demand-side, digitisation, regions).",1,0

The proposed project aims to investigate from an empirical, theoretical and normative perspective this impact, as well as its macroeconomic repercussions in terms of productivity, growth, employment, income distribution and the core-periphery technological divide. It will also examine the industrial policies needed to mitigate the technology gaps and to enhance the value capture capacities of peripheral innovation systems by ‘upgrading’ within GVCs, against the backdrop of the financial crisis.  At the empirical level, the project will focus on GVCs of knowledge-based manufacturing industries in crisis-afflicted Southern European economies. It will employ advanced statistical, computational and analytical methods at different geographical scales, ranging from econometric to social network analysis, agent-based, and stock-flow consistent modelling. At the theoretical level, it aspires to combine evolutionary, institutionalist, Schumpeterian and (post) Keynesian economic theories under a ‘systemic’ research programme on the crossroads of international economics, economic geography, innovation economics, theory of the firm, industrial organisation, and political economy of development. At the normative level, it will have significant implications for industrial, RTDI, trade, and regional development policies. This highly topical project aims to frame the post-crisis EU policy discourse on the future of the ERA, the Innovation Union, Europe 2020 growth strategy, and the ‘European investment plan’, as well as related national policy discourses.

There are still some crucial obstacles to overcome before a large-scale production of plastic solar cells can be considered. The latter is the clear aim of all industrial partners here involved. The feasibility of this approach will be proven with a new generation of organic PV having better efficiency ( 5% on 1cm2 glass substrate and 4% on 1cm2 flexible substrate), longer lifetime and a production cost far below those of competing technologies based on silicon. To reach this goal, the following questions will be worked out in parallel: 1. Design and synthesis of new materials to overcome the large mismatch between the currently available polymer materials absorption characteristics and the solar emission spectrum and also to improve the mediocre charge transport properties. 2. Development of two device concepts to improve efficiencies: all-organic solar cells and nanocrystal/organic hybrid solar cells : All-organic solar cells will be based on donor-acceptor bulk heterojunction built by blending of two organic materials serving as electron donor (hole semiconductor, low band gap polymers) and electron acceptor under the form of an homogeneous blend and sandwiching the organic matrix between two electrodes. One of these electrodes is transparent and the other is usually an opaque metal electrode. Two concepts will be developed to improve efficiencies: a) an innovative junction concept based on the orientation of polar molecules and b) a multi-junction bulk donor-acceptor heterojunction concept.Nanocrystal/organic hybrid solar cells will be based upon solid-state heterojunctions between nanocrystalline metal oxides and molecular/polymeric hole conductors.

A strategy has been developed for structuring and cataloguing information that has been or will be produced in the area of telematics applications within the fourth Framework Programme (4th FP). The strategy provides a framework for information services so that research or technology development results may be disseminated and exploited to a maximum degree. It is based on the following concepts: performing an information audit; the development of an information policy; indexing and classification of the information; use of a thesaurus to control the indexing vocabulary; keyword searching, either against defined index terms, or by using free text retrieval; provision of information in defined formats.   The strategy is aimed at addressing the information needs of a wide range of people. The intended users are: persons involved in the process of classifying and indexing 4th FP deliverable items; persons involved with defining keywords, thesaurus and glossary entries for 4th FP deliverable items; persons involved in developing structures for the dissemination of 4th FP information using information servers and CD-ROM technologies.  This document is the model for use in European telematic engineering applications report, deliverable D2.1 of the MANDATE project.

MANDATE aimed to establish a practical basis for coordination and concertation of future real time data (RTD) projects, and to develop a framework for information services, so that RTD results could be disseminated and exploited to a maximum degree. A management framework has been developed called comprehensive analysis of trans European aspects of telematics applications (CANTATA). It is a structured pragmatic framework that may be used to facilitate the management of a trans European application (TTA). It should not be considered as yet another methodology for designing and implementing telematics networks, but rather as an organized set of guidelines of good management practice, which integrates and reconciles a number of existing project management methods, tools and techniques. The following models were proposed for use in a European telematic environment:  organisation model;  information model;  telematic model;  security model;  management model. The models could be used by a proposed TTA project to construct realizations for comparison and better understanding. They have been used by the partners to help ensure completeness, and to understand the implications of change.

This document covers the management aspects of the comprehensive analysis of trans European aspects of telematics applications (CANTATA) framework. CANTATA was constructed to assist in the management of trans European telematics applications. The framework may be used in various levels of detail, for projects ranging from development of a demonstrator to fully fledged expansive European applications. CANTATA comprises a time line representing 6 evolution stages of a trans European telematic application (TTA) from an idea to an installed, working system, and 8 management aspects requiring consideration at all stages of the evolution of the TTA. This forms a matrix of management modules, not necessarily of equal duration or importance in all projects. In each module, the TTA specific aspects (multicultural, multiautonomous, and noncompatible) were examined, giving rise to a number of issues. These issues were discussed and solutions, tools and techniques, and references suggested where possible. The CANTATA framework offers potential implementors of trans European telematics applications the benefit of past experiences by focusing on the issues particular to the trans European aspects of the TTA. The framework concentrates on the management issues in particular, and can be used through the complete development lifecycle, from the initial idea stage, through the requirements, conceptual design, implementation, and post implementation stages.

D2.3 is the continuation of the CANTATA framework developed in MANDATE deliverable D2.2. It represents stage 6 of a trans European telematic application (TTA) evolution (ie the management of a TTA after it has been installed, commissioned and accepted by the users). This stage, arguably, represents the most difficult part of managing a TTA, since many of the TTA project personnel will move on to other projects.

MANDATE aimed to establish a practical basis for coordination and concertation of future real time data (RTD) projects, and to develop a framework for information services, so that RTD results could be disseminated and exploited to a maximum degree. The MANDATE information strategy was described from 2 perspectives:  in terms of the organizational requirements for establishing the strategy, and setting up policies for acquiring information, processing information, storing and retrieving information, and maintaining and disseminating information;  in terms of the different users, and the roles involved in the information lifecycle. These roles are the information manager, the information provider, and the information users. The intended users are:  project and programme managers;  information providers, managers, and users;  organizations and projects wishing to apply the information strategy. The rules and guidelines for the implementation of the information strategy were presented. Practical issues were addressed, and detailed guidance given on how the strategy could be developed. The following areas were covered:  the process that organizations wishing to use the information strategy need to put in place;  a set of rules and guidelines for how information is to be accessed;  the roles and responsibilities of information providers, users, and managers;  the use of information audits, and the development of an information strategy.

It also features searching using free text retrieval. MANDATE is a horizontal activity aiming to develop an operational framework, wherein telematics projects can focus on the development of applications, while organisational and managerial assistance is made available to them in a consolidated and practical form. Therefore, among the basic criteria used for the specification of the high level objectives of MANDATE, were the usability, completeness and applicability of its results.   Expected Impacts   MANDATE is preparing the ground for horizontal activities, not only in the context of Telematics Engineering, but also in the Telematics Programme as a whole. The added value that can be expected from the project expands at several levels, as its contributions address aspects encountered frequently in the environment of European R&D projects. Such contributions start with the efficient management of the life-cycle of telematics applications, which eventually leads to protection of the investment in new projects. Checklists and road-maps will minimise the administrative overhead, and will help introduce in project management, proven best practices as well as a quality sensitive approach.   Work on programme concertation mechanisms on the other hand, will result in consistency of the overall programme output and improvement of inter-project communication for the purpose of achieving consensus and exchanging experiences. This can bring significant benefits, such as more frequent and reliable contributions to the standardisation process, convergence of technologies and alignment of technical solutions adopted in different domains. The report of the project on this topic will cover therefore the formation of user groups, the creation of special interest groups or other similar fora among project participants, the organisation of conferences and other open events, the edition of publications, as well as other promotional activities.   A further contribution is envisaged in the field of information dissemination and exploitation of results of the 4th Framework Programme. The 4th Framework Programme as a whole will generate an enormous amount of information which is in the public domain. Whereas access to this bulky information will be facilitated by paper based information dissemination mechanisms, access to the underlying knowledge will remain difficult for many project participants. This is due to a number of factors, such as the variety and the specifics of each participant organisation (national culture, available skills, organisational structure, etc.), the complexity of managerial and technical issues, the availability of skills and experience to solve the issues and the gap between available 'state of the art' or 'reference' material and the real-world problems.  The aim of MANDATE work in this context is to contribute to bridging the 'knowledge gap' that is likely to hamper access to information and will no doubt inhibit the smooth and efficient development of telematics projects. MANDATE is therefore studying the structure and formats to be adopted for a results repository in the 4th Framework Programme, so as to enable project participants to provide their deliverables in a more usable and exploitable form.   Target Audience   On the whole, it is estimated that MANDATE deliverables will have a multiple impact, as they will be of value to potential users (professionals or not) of telematics applications which seek to implement economic solutions based on state-of-the-art technology, consortia involved or with an intention to be involved in the 4th Framework Programme, the European Commission.   Key Results and Deliverables   The deliverables that MANDATE will produce include : - A project life-cycle management methodology, for the development, maintenance and evaluation of trans-European telematics applications. The methodology will offer modeling capabilities for trans-European telematics applications from five different perspectives; it will be specified in a single report. An easy to use road-map and early demonstrator tools will also be available. - A report with guidelines on the efficient organisation of workshops or other similar events from which the European Commission can obtain feedback concerning the priorities of R&D activities.  - A report proposing mechanisms for the coordination and management of the Telematics Programme.  - Three different workshops addressing: multimedia applications in the Telematics Programme, security requirements in the integrated data telematics environment, and management of trans-European telematics applications.  - A report describing the structure (taxonomy and indexing strategy) for the results repository of the 4th Framework Programme, along with a prototype CD-ROM implementing this structure.  - A user guide for projects to produce input in a form that allows for automatic integration of their results into the repository.  - A CD-ROM containing all MANDATE reports, which will be disseminated to all interested parties.",0,0
129,16972,Yes,Pollution REDuction by Information and Control Techniques,"The objectives of the project are (i) to establish environmental standards in consultation with all the relevant authorities throughout the EC and (ii) to develop a scheme for reducing environmental pollution in Central Business Districts through the use of traffic operation and control measures. Within pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT), a multipath assignment model is used for assignment of traffic to the network. This is based on the stochastic assignment procedure developed by Dial. The algorithm assigns trips to all reasonable paths simultaneously in such a way that the resulting effect is identical to what would have been obtained had each path been assigned trips separately under certain choice probability assumptions. The assignment procedure can be used to select paths through the network which are environmentally optimal. The area under pollution control can cover the whole network or subnetwork. If the control area is a subnetwork, generally the model reduces significantly the congestion and the pollution of this area, trying at the same time not to increase the pollution at the periphery. The control area is defined by the link numbers of the network. The accurate estimation of emissions from mobile sources needs a detailed representation of traffic flows. The functions of the traffic model within the PREDICT suite are fulfilled by TRANSYT. This has 2 main elements; a traffic model and a signal optimiser. The model represents traffic behaviour in a network of streets in which most junctions are controlled by traffic signals. The model predicts the value of a performance index for the network, which is a measure of the overall cost of traffic congestion, and is usually a weighted combination of the total amount of delay and the number of stops experienced by traffic. The optimisation process adjusts the signal timings and checks, using the model, whether the adjustments reduce the performance index. By adopting only those adjustments which reduce the performance index, signal timings are successively improved until an optimum is reached. Output gives several measures related to overall traffic performance. These include total distance travelled, time spent on the network, and mean journey speeds over the network. Total delays and stops are also output, together with fuel consumption figures. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  The pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT) emissions model, known as PREMIT, uses the output from the traffic model to calculate the quantities of various pollutants emitted by traffic travelling on the road network. PREMIT is a model which takes account of the amount of time spent by vehicles in various driving modes. It can also model emissions of any pollutant and allows the urban vehicle fleet composition to be defined by the user. The model has been developed with maximum flexibility in mind, and it can be easily updated with data that reflect the emissions characteristics of new vehicles. The PREDICT emissions model takes into account the proportion of time spent in various driving modes (cruise, acceleration, deceleration, idle) and hence the quantity of pollutants emitted in each mode. The model works on the basis that these modes are a consequence of stopping and starting at the intersections between each link. The vehicles which are delayed along a link are assumed to step through each driving mode. Vehicles accelerate off from an intersection and then reach cruise speed. When they get within stopping distance of a stop line or the back of a queue, the vehicles will then decelerate to a halt and idle within the queue. The model can also incorporate data for a range of vehicle types which are considered to have different emission characteristics. Any vehicle type can be represented so long as data are available for the vehicle's emission rates across all driving modes and the proportion it makes up of the whole fleet for the network being modelled. This capability allows the modelling of different vehicle types, with and without emission reduction devices. The emissions model calculates the emission rates of pollutants for each link within the road network. The emissions model can accept traffic performance data from any source or traffic model, provided it is correctly formatted. Having calculated pollutant emission rates for each link within the network, the model generates an output file which contains parameters that can be used to give a direct assessment of environmental performance, or can be input to a dispersion model to calculate resulting pollutant concentrations. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  The dispersion model currently used in the pollution reduction by information and control strategies (PREDICT) model suite is PREDCO. This is essentially a microscale model, in which local pollutant concentrations are determined as a result of emissions on particular links and prevailing atmospheric conditions. The input data required by this model are the definition of the road network, the location of the receptor where the pollutants are measured, traffic flows and speeds, the wind speed and direction. The road network must be reduced to a set of straight line sections which are specified by the coordinates of their endpoints. The wind speed is given in metres per second and the wind direction in degrees from grid north (ie a wind blowing from the north has a direction of zero degrees, from the east 90 degrees). To run the pollution prediction routine of the model, an input file containing link and receptor location coordinates must be present. Traffic flow and speed data and the estimated prevailing emission rates are passed to the dispersion model internally from the assignment and the emission model, respectively. Meteorological data are generally assumed to be constant across the network. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  Strategy one, environmental optimisation of traffic signal settings, aimed to investigate a relatively low cost solution to the high pollution levels being encountered in some European cities. Overall, this strategy reduced pollutant emissions which arose when the manually optimised or nonoptimised network was optimised using TRANSYT. It also shows that changing the weightings between delays and stops would have had only a relatively small additional effect on overall pollutant emissions levels. In modelling strategy two, pollution sensitive traffic rerouting, various percentages of compliance to the hypothesised transmission of information to vehicles were considered. For evaluation purposes, the particular scenario was examined in which 30 percent of vehicles complied with the guidance advice given. Emissions levels on the ring network within the case study area were then examined using the pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT) model suite. This strategy produced reductions in the levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon emissions over the base case. The modelling of the third strategy, introduction of clean vehicles, was again achieved using the PREDICT model suite. This was run initially with 10 percent of petrol cars having a catalytic converter. Subsequent model runs represented an increasing proportion of catalytic converters. The results obtained clearly indicated that the introduction of catalytic converters on all petrol cars looks to be a very effective way of reducing pollutant emissions within an urban area. If the emissions of other vehicle types in the fleet (in the case study area, diesel taxis and buses) were reduced then network emissions could be reduced even further. This strategy therefore promises a much higher and healthier standard of air quality within European cities in the future. Strategy four, environmental area licensing, would involve restricting access to a defined central area of a c ity to vehicles fitted with a catalytic converter. Again, this strategy appeared to be potentially effective at reducing the pollutant emissions within the controlled area. The percentage of vehicles fitted with catalytic converters outside the controlled area had a small effect on the total emissions for the whole case study network. A prototype was made available on 08/25/92  Road traffic is currently a major contributor to overall air pollution levels experienced in urban areas. As traffic levels rise towards the end of this century, urban congestion is set to become an even greater problem in terms of its environmental effects. Many countries are therefore looking for ways to reduce and minimise these effects. Potential solutions to traffic related pollution include use of new vehicle technologies and improved traffic control techniques. Within this framework, the pollution reduction by information and control techniques (PREDICT) project was undertaken to assess the potential of new road transport informatics (RTI) technologies for pollution reduction. PREDICT focused primarily on developing alternative RTI-base control strategies and evaluating their effects on air pollution levels. A number of RTI-based control strategies and schemes were developed within PREDICT to reduce environmental pollution in urban areas. These encompassed environmental optimisation of traffic signal timings, pollution sensitive traffic rerouting, introduction of clean vehicles and environmental area licensing. Each of the PREDICT control strategies was developed with particular environmental policy objectives in mind. These included reduction in pollution levels over a wide area, reduction in pollution levels within a defined city centre area and reduction in pollution levels at particular hot spots on the road network. Each of these was seen as a legitimate policy objective in the light of increasing concern over urban air pollution. A major aspect of PREDICT was the development of a comprehensive model suite. This forms a powerful tool which can be used to predict and analyse the environmental effects of different traffic management measures and control strategies. The emissions model included in the suite represents a significant advance on previous models, with representation of traffic activity at the microlevel. The model suite was applied within th e PREDICT project to evaluate the effects and impacts of the 4 PREDICT control strategies. This showed that there is significant potential for use of road transport informatics (RTI) technologies in reducing air pollution. Effective control strategies can make use of RTI in conjunction with pollution monitoring and prediction systems, and can also incorporate use of vehicle emissions control technologies. The results suggested that the most effective control strategies for reducing air pollution will combine traffic restrictions or demand management techniques with emissions reducing engine technologies. However, the cost and/or institutional barriers associated with such strategies are probably the greatest. Other strategies may be more appropriate in some cities, depending on the exact nature of the pollution problem and on local political acceptability considerations. A prototype was made available on 08/25/92 This will largely be based on modelling which will predict the pollution effects of various RTI strategies. Pollution monitoring systems will also be studied to develop and define monitoring plans and a `pollution advisory' tool which will give traffic controllers an overall picture of both environmental and traffic conditions on their road network.  The consortium has already developed a model which calculates air pollution levels on the basis of traffic signal timing and route guidance systems amongst other things. The model will be refined and enhanced to include a capability within the vehicle emission sub-model for the separate representation of vehicles with and without emission reducing devices. After a review of the model specifications in the boarder context of the project, the model will be validated on the basis of historical data from a European city.  The potential for the reduction of pollution levels will be assessed against all relevant RTI based traffic operations and control measures. The benefits of implementing a given control measure will be assessed in a European city, comparing its effects (including those on human health) with a base scenario representing the existing situation. New, more stringent, pollution standards will be recommended which should be feasible as a result of the introduction of RTI.  At a later date the project will consider using real time data from the monitoring tool in a model describing the complexities of gas dynamics, air mass transport, urban topography and traffic flow. This tool would be used to generate detailed short term pollution forecasts.  Main Deliverables:  Software; assessment of benefits from pollution reduction.",0,1

Within the convergence process of interactive multimedia applications - ranging from entertainment to engineering - the COMIQS achievements will be validated in the field of Electronic Commerce.  The added value and specific contribution of COMIQS reside in the implementation and experiment of the following service and technical features:    -All-media integration in a 3D virtual catalogue integrating digital high quality multimedia with video, photo-realistic images and high quality sound.    -Increased interactivity with content such as objects contained in motion pictures, audio tracks, 3D objects i.e. not restricted to clickable icons or buttons or hypertext links (already available on Internet).    -Real-time streaming of all media into the user-sided scene, facilitating navigation allowing at the same time a better adaptation of the content presentation process to available network resources.    -Placement of MPEG-4 into the Internet context, in the spirit of ITU-H.225 and of IETF Audio-Visual Transport Group.    -Quality of Service (QoS) management, from best-effort to predicted QoS, encompassing scaleable services on a variety of access networks, from narrowband to broadband Internet.  COMIQS will focus on the exploitation of MPEG-4 added functionalities for the given applications.  It will also address the use of DMIF for QoS provision in heterogeneous network environments. On the Internet side, COMIQS will work towards a Request For Comments (RFC) for MPEG-4 over Real Time Protocol (RTP).  Technical Approach  COMIQS will implement a European MPEG-4 platform based on an open and interoperable multimedia client/server architecture, on IP/IPng-based transport systems.   This architecture will be in compliance with the MPEG-4/DMIF model, and will support a JAVA based open and flexible application signalling framework, encompassing Internet application signalling concepts. It will also support Quality of Service (QoS) provision for IP/IPng-based transport systems. This multimedia platform will consist of:    -a complete MPEG4 compliant object-oriented terminal.    -a multimedia server platform supporting audio-visual information and interactive 3D graphics. This server will be able to provide content adapted to networks ranging from the current Internet service to high-bandwidth high-quality stream service. Expected Achievements  COMIQS phase-1 will deliver after 12 months a version-1 of the client/server platform, supporting the following main features:    -Operation over IP/IPng-based transport systems without QoS management, and without end-to-end object time base.    -Application signalling : Stream service based on DSM CC UU and/or RTSP and file service based on HTTP.    -An MPEG-4/DMIF Application Interface.    -COMIQS' terminal version-1 will include a complete decoding and presentation unit supporting MPEG-4 compliant audio/video decoding as well as an MPEG-4 compliant 'parametric (Binary Information For Scenes : BIFS)' scene description.    -COMIQS' server version-1 will include adapted database management tools and executives (database queries, dynamic scene updates etc.) necessary to support the MPEG-4 electronic commerce applications. This first platform will allow the demonstration of a first set of service functionalities - integrated 2D and 3D contents, higher degree of interactivity, real-time streaming of synchronised 2D AV and 3D media on Internet - in a first application configuration and the implementation of usability testing with real end users. COMIQS phase-2 after two years will enhance the client/server platform version-1, incorporating the following extra features :    -Operation over IP/IPng-based transport systems - also on top of ATM - with QoS management,    -A complete open application signalling framework relying on JAVA,    -MIF compliant implementation of a DMIF/Network Interface for Internet (not specified yet in DMIF at the time of writing)    -COMIQS' terminal and server version-2 with QoS provision, and possibly 'programmatic' scene description facilities.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Demonstrative applications in mail order and tourism promoting MPEG-4 use in E-commerce. An important contribution has been made to ISO/MPEG and to IETF with two IETF. Contribution to the programme It strengthened the position of European companies in the development of new standardised specifications and in the use of emerging technologies. It increased the awareness on the potential of the MPEG-4 technology. Key Issues  The key issues of COMIQS will be :    -to define user and service requirements, to design scenarios for two home shopping applications and to create contents and associated application executives.    -to develop the client/server MPEG-4 architecture on IP/IPng-based transport systems, using Real Time Protocols and Real Time Control Protocol (RTP/RTCP).    -to specify and to implement the mapping of the MPEG-4 buffer, timing and multiplexing model over RTP/RTCP, and to contribute to IETF on the definition of RTP payload for the transport of MPEG-4.    -to specify and to implement network signalling : this encompasses DMIF network interfaces at different levels, TransMux Instance able to create RTP connections, or FlexMux Channels multiplexed in a single connection.    -to specify and to implement application signalling - between peer applications, including stream, file and directory services - not addressed so far by DMIF. For the stream service, as an alternative to DSM CC UU, the project will also consider an open JAVA based application signalling framework encompassing the Internet streaming protocols e.g. RTSP.    -to investigate and to specify mechanisms to support dynamic bandwidth negotiation and QoS management. This encompasses interpretation and translation of generic QoS parameters (to be defined by DMIF) requested by the application into network specific QoS traffic parameters. For IP, possible standard solutions - RSVP - or proprietary solutions will be investigated.    -to specify and to implement the complete terminal architecture integrating the network and application signalling, demultiplexing and network adaptation, developed by the project with audio/video decoding, 3D rendering and presentation modules provided as background.    -to specify and to implement the complete server architecture supporting the developed applications. It will be built upon an existing DAVIC compliant server with significant extensions (communication and database management modules) towards the Internet and MPEG-4 DMIF model.   Summary of Trials  COMIQS will carry out three pan-European experiments covering service and technical aspects : two service experiments will involve respectively real end users and Electronic Commerce professionals, and will assess the market perspectives of COMIQS features. In two locations more than twenty users will be involved. The technical experiment will validate the MPEG-4 technology over the Internet, including QoS management provision, scaleable services on a variety of access networks.  Expected Impact  COMIQS will contribute to the growth of Electronic Commerce business in Europe by introducing new service features. More generally, COMIQS technology will impact other sectors such as entertainment, distance education, collaborative engineering, telework, etc. and in turn the consumer electronic industry.

126,81413,Yes,European Coaching Innovation Standard,"The TEEE-Inn project of the Innovation program has developed since 2002 a method and associated tools for coaching innovative start-ups, and has demonstrated the benefits of using these in a concerted manner between incubators of five European regions. The Technology Transfer Accelerator project of EIF assesses the feasibility of a new type of investment vehicle focused on financing the commercialisation of the results of research. Today, these results are regarded by key finance actors as a breakthrough to be deployed in Europe to facilitate the access of innovative start-ups to early-stage venture capital. EUCIST proposes to disseminate these results to European incubators, in the ICT sector, via the Gate 2 Growth and PAXIS networks. Our aim is to increase significantly the number of new innovative start-ups of the ICT sector, and to reduce their failure rate, in all Member States. Concrete results to be deployed include classical individual support (selection process, commercial and marketing mapping, mentoring, economic intelligence support) and novel small team coaching services: - Specific training for future coaches - BizDev events, which lean to existing major commercial events to organise meetings between entrepreneurs and decision makers - IVCS: the International Venture Capital Summit, where start-ups meet investors. To maximise access to technological clusters, remote markets and investment community, the dissemination will take place into the ICT sector focussing on Software, Telecom and Micro electronics, among candidate regions, not necessarily known for their high potential innovation. To motivate incubators apply for EUCIST, we guarantee a faster access to venture capital for their start-ups.

709,30486,No,Adaptive and adaptable interactions for multimedia telecommunications applIcations,"The main objective of the project is to demonstrate that it is possible to develop generic multimedia telecommunications applications, which are adaptable and adaptive to the requirements of most potential users (including e.g. disabled people, elderly people, occasional users, professionals), in terms of networks and terminals, information content and human-computer interface. Practical testing is foreseen in field trials of applications of important social impact and potential commercial value (services for citizens and tourists, in terms of information support to mobility of people on a territory). Results already achieved by the project are the following: Collection of detailed data about information needs on mobility, access problems and usable media of selected user groups; Selection and adaptation of telecommunications environments for the trials in Italy and Finland (including at least one broadband transport facility), assuring interoperability; Development of concepts and system components (multimedia document structure, content model of information, central user model), as a foundation for the introduction of adaptability and adaptivity to the needs of individual users, at the level of both content and presentation of information and the human-computer interface; Implementation of adaptable and adaptive representations of information and human-computer interfaces, as a function of the user and telecommunications link; Moreover, the expected achievements from the project are listed below: Integration of a set of adaptations of information and terminal interfaces in specific applications running on the telecommunications infrastructure to be used for the validation of the technical approaches and for field trials; Execution of field trials in Italy and Finland, including different user groups and test sites, for testing the usability of the implemented application and its relevance; Evaluation of the application from the user's perspective; Dissemination of the concepts and results obtained in the project; Exploitation plans in order to introduce the project results in real operative environments. Expected Impact Improvement in the working and living conditions of disabled and elderly people by reducing barriers to information access; Increase in service effectiveness and integration of existing databases through the production of multimedia documents and the introduction of adaptability and adaptivity concepts; Increase in the quality of information; 'right' information to different users in terms of information content and presentation; Transparent access to geographically distributed databases through a scaleable set of network facilities; Automatic user interface adaptability at design time and adaptivity at run-time.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables A common multimedia system interface was developed, suitable for different network architectures and broadband infrastructures through the realisation of trials involving end users, covering a broad range of citizens, including people with special needs. Contribution to the programme AVANTI demonstrated that it is feasible and useful to employ the concepts of adaptability and adaptability in system development to cater different user needs both at the user interface and at the content level. Technical Approach The project's approach is to demonstrate transparent access to a variety of databases (textual and/or multimedia), some of which are already available or are under development, using a selection of terminals (from text terminals to multimedia terminals) and network facilities (from narrowband to broadband connections). This implies real-time integration and adaptation of information to be transferred as a function of the user abilities and preferences, the available telecommunication infrastructure and terminal. The adaptation at the information content and user interface level is carried out by the concepts of adaptability and adaptivity. Adaptability focuses on the notion of the automatic provision of various presentations with different interaction characteristics, based on knowledge about user needs, abilities and preferences. Adaptivity refers to the ability of adaptive software applications to dynamically modify the dialogue characteristics during user-terminal, user-network and user-application interaction, according to the user behaviour. Validation is considered an integral part of the project, which aims to test in a real environment selected aspects which are crucial for usability of the system (e.g. the user interface), usefulness of the service (e.g. quality of information), impact on the real mobility capabilities of addressed end users (e.g. motor impaired people). Three main steps have been identified: identification of user requirements and service functionalities; design and adaptation of communication and information applications; integration of the system, experimentation and validation of the application.  The testing with end users is carried out by: two field trials (in Siena and Finland); laboratory trials (in Italy and Greece); a field demonstration (in Rome).  The latter experiment aims to demonstrate the system to be implemented for the Year 2000 Jubilee in Rome. Summary of Trial The project foresees two field trials, respectively located in Siena and in Finland, and a demonstration in Rome. Both field trials are realised on existing network facilities, mainly provided by the National Hosts of the two countries. The field trial in Italy mainly addresses motor disabled people with information about accessibility of the territory. The broadband access to the system is assured by sites located on the Tuscany MAN (Siena and Florence sub-networks). Both sub-networks are based on a 140 Mpbs backbone, and are connected through a 34 Mbps link; the sites involved in the trial are provided with 2 and 34 Mbps accesses. Access to the system by the PSTN is tested as well in order to take into account different network capabilities. In the Finnish field trial the testing is carried out with occasional able-bodied and professional users. The application mainly regards information about mobility, entertainment and accommodation facilities at a city level. The trials employs the sites of Kuusamo and Helsinki, where ATM connections are available to the Finnish Host; each site is connected to a 4 Mbps access. The narrowband access to the application is tested through the public N-ISDN service. Key Issues User needs elicitation, both in terms of data content and presentation. Selection and adaptation of telecommunications facilities and terminals. Development of software modules that allow for adaptability and adaptivity at the information content and at the user interface level. Integration and functional testing of the entire system. Field trials in Italy and Finland and assessment of the application. Dissemination and exploitation activities, particularly in the Jubilee perspective.",0,0
820,200016,No,Social Innovation Community,"Developing an enabling environment for social innovation that links actions across the whole field and supports the full exploitation of their potential is vital to addressing societal challenges both in Europe and globally. While there is increasing interest for social innovation as a means of addressing societal challenges, there is also considerable variation in the extent to which different countries and regions have embraced social innovation. There are many research and policy projects and incubation and acceleration programmes with valuable outcomes but these are still largely disconnected. Thus, the overarching aim of this project is to create a ‘network of networks’ of social innovation actors. This Social Innovation Community (SIC) will identify, engage and connect actors including researchers, social innovators, citizens, policy-makers, as well as intermediaries, businesses, civil society organisations and public sector employees. Through our cross-cutting Work Packages, we will deliver engagement, research, experimentation, learning and policy activities that engage with and support each of the networks. We will ensure that our cross-cutting activities are complementary and build on each other’s work, rather than operating in silos. As such, this SIC aims to deepen and strengthen existing networks, forge new connections between networks, and create new links to actors and networks which hitherto have not been included in the field of social innovation. The aims of such a community are to generate new social innovations, develop and scale up successful ideas to share and spread knowledge more effectively in order to improve research, practice and policy-making. By creating an enabling environment for social innovation, the project will improve the overall framework conditions for social innovation in Europe. This in turn will support the creation of opportunities for growth and for overcoming the current social and economic crisis affecting much of Europe.",1,0
925,55447,No,Downloadable Mobile Value-Added-Services through Software Radio and Switching Integrated Platforms,"The objective of MOBIVAS is to define, design, develop and validate an integrated application architecture for downloadable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Value-Added-Services (VAS).  The activities will be to: - Assess a framework for downloadable value added services over different network environments. - Design and implement a framework to provide efficient management of network resources. - Design and develop of mechanisms to allow reliable and seamless switching between different wireless/mobile bearer technologies considering the emerging software defined radio technology. - Specify and implement an integrated software infrastructure on the application layer for enabling means of downloading new, value added application layer services from a VAS Providers' network, interconnected to an Operator, to the end-user mobile stations. - Develop a framework for charging and billing schemes - Integrate modules for an experimental platform for trial support, verify, demonstrate the benefits and synergy of the protect outcomes in a field trial and contribute to the relevant standardisation bodies.  Objectives: The overall objective of MOBIVAS is to develop architectural approaches and prototypical implementations of integrated software platforms and systems, adaptable to different network services and technologies, which will open new opportunities for advanced Value Added Service Providers (VASPs). A key objective of MOBIVAS is to develop innovative and modular network components for the seamless and efficient service provision in converging existing network technologies by combining new wireless technologies with TINA/CORBA principles, by applying sophisticated mechanisms in order to support a required Quality of Service and by introducing novel methods for developing innovative network elements while integrating existing technologies, such as GSM, DECT, Wireless LANs with upcoming ones such as GPRS, UMTS.  Work description: The proposed software defined radio value added service infrastructure can be looked at from three points of views: functional, operational and architectural. By functional we mean the high level features that the 'software defined radio' value added services need. The operational components are the business-dependent operations. The architectural component addresses technological issues. The proposed functional elements cater for open service provision. The evolution of multimedia applications over mobile networks imposes the provision of adaptive services. The services will be able to operate in dynamic usage conditions while maintaining the highest possible level of quality. The generic architecture and functional scheme is illustrated in the figure below. A proposed intelligent service initiation and synthesis environment, based on basic reusable and extendible protocol and services components, enabling the flexible introduction of services and VAS component distribution, will be provided through an open modelling and communication environment. The proposed scheme will result in an integrated application architecture for downloadable 'software defined radio' Value Added Services (VAS) and the introduction of an open, integrated Switching and Network Access architecture and application platform for the support of 'software defined radio' features. Generic interfaces for, e.g. the interaction of radio independent and programmable radio dependent parts, as well as a 'service negotiation' procedure will be introduced for the configuration of the programmable radio dependent parts. The introduced platforms and components will provide intelligence available in a formal and generic way for open service architecture and control, coping with the complexity and requirements of future wireless infrastructure for the provision of adaptable radio schemes and seamless services. On the operational side, a one-stop charging and accounting model for value added services provided by independent contracted VASPs through an operator's network will be provided to the end-user thus eliminating a lot of administrative overhead for the VASP and simplifying the overall usage of multiple VAS by the end user without requiring separate contract agreements and billing with each VASP. The dynamic introduction of new data services into the network will enrich the operator's product offerings with minimal administrative overhead and additionally will be able to discover new revenue streams from sources other than pure traffic (e.g. one-stop billing for VASPs, share of end-user transactions). The choice of the technology support to develop MOBIVAS platform functionality and meet its various requirements depends, in part, on the constraints and limits (e.g. power processing, memory) imposed by the terminal. The development support should provide facilities for communication security needs, as well as for software downloading. Another important aspect in the choice of the technology support is openness, which makes it easy for software engineers to develop new services using standard languages and tools; it also makes it easy for service providers to integrate new services in the VAS platform and to prevent interoperability problems. Two possible candidates for the technology platform: CORBA and JAVA based mobile-agents. CORBA is a standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). In exploring the JAVA mobile agent solution we will seek standard solutions such as MASIF (Mobile Agent System Interoperability Facility). MASIF is a proposal from OMG to add mobile agent interoperability facilities to CORBA. The use of standard solutions, whenever adequate and possible, will lead us to build an open platform.  Milestones: Key Issues - Software download capabilities of the terminal - Capabilities for transparent dynamic download of transport-oriented protocols - Flexibility in Provisioning and Accessing services - Registration of services - Authentication, Security, Accounting/Billing - Service and user Mobility  Expected Impact The contribution of MOBIVAS is the enabling of various VASPs to provide VASs to mobile users. The design of such an integrated environment involves the introduction an interconnection of VASPs via a VASP Network infrastructure, the development of Operator's infrastructure to support a network of VASPs with increased demands on priority and dynamic aspects. Moreover, the Operator's Platform and Software environment will introduce advanced, flexible and dynamic (in terms of IP flows) accounting/billing procedures. The Intelligent Base Station will be designed to cope with the very demanding tasks of terminal classification negotiation, download of Look-up service, service negotiation and fast download of necessary service elements. The mobile user will be transparently connected to available VASPs according to the type of terminal, location, access network.",0,0

For this purpose a new service will be established, based on a pan-European system for information access, retrieval, image browsing and document delivery. This will in turn extend the access and availability of major aerospace collections.  It will develop effective networking links between all EURILIA participants, using a current standard open telecommunications network infrastructure. These links will be used for direct access to the OPACs of significant aerospace collections, based on a standard user interface built on the ISO SR (Z39.50) standard. Document browsing and delivery will be by conventional and electronic image format.  These links will then be used to evaluate the use of the network as a channel for the transmission of document requests and images. Software will be developed to manage these procedures. Parallel with this process, a programme of systematic record access in combination with advanced information retrieval software will be undertaken. Impact and expected results:  EURILIA will demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-site, multi-country document delivery system, with standard user interface and image browsing features, in aerospace libraries. Such a system, by making aerospace related information more easily, more accurately and more extensively available, will facilitate the research and education process in that sector.

532,106931,No,Development of a Research Environment for Advanced Modelling of Soft matter,"'DREAMS aims at developing an integrated theoretical-computational approach for the efficient description of linear and non-linear spectroscopies of several classes of organic probes, dispersed in polymeric matrices that range in complexity from simple polyolefins all the way to large biomolecules (proteins and polysaccharides). In order to reach this objective, developments along the following lines are required: (i) elaboration of new theoretical models, to expand the scope of currently available treatments; (ii) definition of specific treatments for intermediate regions / regimes in the context of space- and time-multiscale descriptions; (iii) algorithmic implementation of the developed models / protocols in computational codes and, (iv) their efficient integration allowing for seamless flow of information and easy use by non-specialists. A crucial asset for the success of the planned theoretical-computational developments is represented by an extensive network of solid collaborations with leading experimental groups, that will be involved in the synthesis and characterization of the different chromophore / matrix systems, as well as in the in-depth characterization of their spectroscopic responses. These interactions will thus allow for a stringent and exhaustive validation of the capabilities required of a general and versatile computational tool; at the same time, the experimental groups will make full use of advanced theoretical interpretations in the context of a real-world technological problem. In summary, DREAMS relies on a carefully planned combination of theoretical developments, computational implementations, and interactions with experimentalists, in order to achieve a novel and cutting-edge result, namely to provide the scientific community with a set of computational tools that will make possible the simulation and prediction of response and spectroscopic properties of multi-component materials.'",0,0

693,226139,No,FAST-RESPONSIVE and LONG-LASTING TRANSPARENT PHOTOCHROMIC FILMS,"Photochromic materials capable of undergoing reversible colour changes upon irradiation of light have potential revolutionary applications as optics and electronic devices, information displays and as smart materials. Due to technical limitations it has been so far a niche technology in most markets and currently 80% of their current commercial use is in the ophthalmic sector. Through this SME Instrument project, we at Futurechromes aim to validate the commercial feasibility of our proprietary fast responsive photochromic technology and translate it into consumer products in the eyewear, and architecture sectors. Our fast responsive photochromic films based on nanoencapsulation of the photochromic dyes, provides the speed, transparency, and other technical requirements, which have been hindering the widespread use of photochromatic materials. Moreover, our technology can be easily adapted to current manufacturing processes thus envisioning affordable fabrication costs. Building on a real market demand and partnerships with industry end-users in the ophthalmic sector already established, our technology has been validated to TRL6 as a forerunner to this project. Over the course of this Phase 1 SME Instrument, we will perform a feasibility study to define our product manufacturing strategy and to validate the economic viability of our product in the target end-user markets. Our goal is to ensure that our films are commercially available by 2022. We will develop on our business plan, whereby the commercial targets are to reach annual turnover of 8.15M€ by 2024 achieving 1.5% of our initial target market and incorporating 12 new full-time employees within the period 2019-2024.",0,0

Summary of the Action:  This action blends a mature scientific activity in the field of applied statistics and econometrics with an active and dedicated support to key EU policies, such as the common market for services, the EURO challenge and sustainability, employment and cohesion. It is divided into five main lines. The first one deals with macroeconomic modelling, whereby JRC runs on its computers under TROLL (an operating environment) selected sub-modules of the QUEST II (a macroeconomic analysis tool) to improve their performance. The second one focuses on short- term economic analysis, where JRC is also part of large networks (e.g. on business cycle analysis, on short-term indicators). A third activity constructs statistical indicators. A fourth activity deals with financial econometrics in support to the EC policy for a single market for financial services. The fifth and last activity is sensitivity analysis, where JRC has a leadership position.  This benefits the third and fourth activities and is also put to use in a number of third party works. The JRC is partner in a number of co-operative projects and as such takes fully part in the European Research Area. Rationale The growth and stability pact, the common market for services, and EU enlargement are the key challenges of today's Europe. The present European Commission is in dramatic need of modern econometric and statistical tools to gauge the progresses on these policies. The Joint Research Centre, with its research in applied statistics and econometrics, provides the ideal support to the commission, also when the information dealt with is of a high confidential nature. Examples are the use of Bayesian tools for model identification in economic medium term forecast (DG ECFIN), the use of reverse sensitivity analysis for the Capital Adequacy directive (DG MARKT) and the development of composite indicators to gauge the progresses of the common market (DG MARKT).'",0,0

154,96237,Yes,Emerging communities for collective innovation: ICT Operational tool and supporting methodologies for SME Associations,"The pace of technological change is accelerating. Radical discontinuities seem to happen more frequently. This means that the useful lifespan of knowledge and capability is becoming shorter and that the obsolescence of knowledge/capability is increasingly the norm in innovation. For incremental innovation, specialisation is a winning strategy, but radical innovation requires an interdisciplinary approach and a diversity of knowledge base that in general SMEs struggle to access. COLLECTIVE aims at solving the major constraints of SMEs innovation (to achieve successful, repeated organizational innovation; access to learning and knowledge processing; access to cognitive diversity; have the possibility to be connected to foster collaborative projects) by feeding the innovation ecosystem, basing on 3 key-concepts: (a)communities become the new organisational unit of the innovation process and define the ecosystem of innovation; (b) generation of innovative ideas, new product development and diffusion of innovations are carried out in parallel by self-organising communities of different actors (i.e.: customers, suppliers, users, experts, social stakeholders); (c) the key aspect that will define success or failure in discontinuous innovation projects will be the amount of cognitive diversity that firms (or groups of) will be able to gather and manage. iCOMMUNITY ICT operational platform will be the backbone of this innovation ecosystem and will let SMEs and SMEAGs: (1) identify future emergent technological and economic trends/discontinuities by developing network-based approaches to early detect ‘weak signals’; (2) manage distributed intelligence and creativity in the process of new product development in order to individuate new product ideas and related business models; (3) design new modular products in a collaborative way reducing the market risk since relevant inputs and feedback from customers and end users will be constantly ‘embedded’ in the design process.",1,1

360,14493,No,Distributed Industrial Design and Manufacturing of Electronic Sub-assemblies,"The DIDAMES project will demonstrate the application of local and wide-area broadband communications within a distributed industrial design and manufacturing system for electronic sub-assemblies.  The aim of the research was to demonstrate the application of local and wide area broadband communications within a distributed industrial design and manufacturing system for electronic subassemblies. Key issues in the research included: modelling, designing and setting up a pilot applicable to virtually all distributed printed circuit board (PCB) computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes; the determination of the quality of the integrated broadband communication (IBC) services necessary; analysing security requirements and implementing appropriate security mechanisms; the determination and provision of the user interfaces required; the utilization (and integration) of standard document interchange formats; establishing present limitations of existing networks and (international) interworking capabilities; preserving optimum portability; demonstrating the potential managerial efficiency improvements achievable through this application.  Two demonstration models of the application pilot were made available. The early demonstrator was based on broadband technology and served to demonstrate the potential of broadband technology for realizing high quality printed circuit (PC) integrated videoconferencing. The second demosnstration model was based on narrowband technology and provided a low cost solution to PC integrated videoconferencing. As a consequence, virtually all communications technologies are suitable for the system. In addition, the system has been augmented by the most advanced security technology in order to be protected against listening/falsification attacks. These integral security mechanisms are based on advanced chip card technology using encryption/decryPtion by the Ricest-Shamir-AdlemAn (DES) and RSA algorithms. Technical Approach    With rapid technological developments having severe cost implications, there is an urgent need to support the decentralisation and geographical distribution of the design and manufacturing processes for integrated circuits, multi-layer printed circuit boards and electronic sub-assemblies.  Geographical separation of design, manufacturing and other tasks requires remote access to data for design, manufacturing and test activities.  In addition, totally new control structures and mechanisms are required to synchronise the distributed design and manufacturing tasks with customer orders.    The proposed distributed application uses high performance international communication links, such as would be provided by IBC, and demonstrates the integration of video and voice to support interactive CAD-CAM applications.  This will generate substantial bursts of data traffic on a wide area network. Whenever available bandwidth turns out to be a bottle- neck, very advanced data compression techniques will be applied.  This permits the DIDAMES system to also be supported by narrowband communication links, when no broadband communications are available.    The project also demonstrates the usefulness of international technical and document oriented data interchange standards (such as ODA, STEP) and other international agreements on communications, user interfaces and security issues (such as X-Windows, OSF/Motif, TELETRUST).    The DIDAMES project ends in February 1992.    Key issues   . Modelling, designing and setting-up a pilot applicable to virtually all distributed PCB-CAD/CAM processes.   . Determination of the quality of IBC services necessary.   . Analysing security requirements and implementing appropriate security mechanisms.   . Determination and provision of user interfaces required.   . Utilisation (and integration) of standard document interchange formats.   . Establishing present limitations of existing networks and (international) interworking capabilities.   . Preserving optimum portability.   . Demonstrating the potential managerial efficiency improvements achievable through this application.    Achievements   Two demonstrators of the DIDAMES application pilot have been made available.  The early demonstrator was based on broadband technology and served to demonstrate the potential of broadband technology for realising high- quality PC-integrated videoconferencing.  This was successfully demonstrated at several international fairs and exhibitions, such as the CeBIT fair in Hannover and the SYSTEMS fair in Munich.    The current demonstrator is based on narrowband technology and provides a low-cost solution to PC- integrated videoconferencing.  As a consequence, virtually all communications technologies are suitable for the DIDAMES system (B-ISDN, ISDN, FDDI, Ethernet, ...).  In addition to this, the DIDAMES system has been augmented by most advanced security technology in order to be protected against listening/falsification attacks.  These integral security mechanisms are based on advanced chip-card technology using encryption/decryption by the DES and RSA algorithms.    The DIDAMES system is completely application- independent and universally applicable.  Any DOS/UNIX application system, with or without MS-Windows or X- Windows/MOTIF user interface, can be transparently supported.  The system may thus be considered as 'open', with interfaces in compliance with the respective international standards.  The final version, having the complete set of this functionality, will be demonstrated in a multi-point configuration on the CeBIT '92 fair in Hannover, supported by p x 64 kbit/s ISDN connections, where 1<=p<=30.    Expected Impact   This project is viewed as an important element in the development of a competitive pan-European electronics industry which makes full use of the community communications infrastructure, also integrating narrowband communications techniques.  It will also test the limitation of the existing wide-area networks and the networking capability of the telecommunications systems of several member states.",0,0

258,57850,No,WAP Access for a Home Automation Server,"HomeOnAir will provide advance home control services by means of a wireless remote access based on WAP technology, thus standardising and simplifying the methods and means for residential users to get access to their houses.  This goal implies the convergence of two distinct technologies: 1. Home networking / Home automation 2. The emerging Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)Trials will aim at the introduction of WAP technology to access a home automation server that is already available, but its commercial exploitation has not begun yet. By applying WAP technology, the final purpose is to extend the potential range of users covered and to offer them a more friendly interface for performing the full set of automation tasks.  Objectives:  Trials will aim at the introduction of WAP technology to access a set of home automation services already available. Trials will be focused on two bearers: both circuit-switched and packet-switched, over the existing GSM network and the emerging GPRS network respectively. By applying WAP technology to remotely access a home automation server, the final purpose is to extend the potential range of users covered (mobile phones are becoming more and more popular) and to offer them a more friendly interface for performing the full set of automation tasks available now through conventional Internet access. As business targets, the final objective will be an increase in the expected revenues either directly, by charging for the deployment of a new service, or indirectly, by increasing the number and the quality of the distribution channels.  Work description: The project will start with the activities devoted to obtain the specification of a suitable technological architecture for performing the trials. These activities will have as inputs the current practice and the innovative technologies to be applied. Afterwards, the implementation work of the required HW/SW adaptations of the existing home automation server and the integration of the defined services will be carried out. Then, the trials itself will take place. Two types of users will be selected: a limited number of qualified users, with the system installed at their homes, and a wider group of users that will evaluate the system in a laboratory environment. The results of this experimentation will be measured and evaluated and feed back will be provided to the previous activities in order to increase the possibilities to meet the market needs. Moreover, an important work to achieve a broad and rapid diffusion of the results will be performed.  Milestones: A description of the services, architecture and man-machine interface. The complete HomeOnAir system available for installation. A report on measurements and evaluation of the trials. The dissemination of results phase complete. HomeOnAir milestones met per workpackage were: WP1 ('Project Management'):- Kick-off meeting.- End of the take-up action. WP2 ('Architecture definition'):- Description of the physical level architecture of the system completed.- Description of the high level services and man-machine interface. The specification of the architecture proposed in HomeOnAir was guided by the architecture followed by the previous implementation of the home-services platform developed by TID. This platform was based in a PC (as by that time there were not commercial residential gateways that could substitute the functionalities offered by the user's PC), and its main advantage was that it was totally modular and scalable, and thus could cover as many user interfaces and home networks as possible. The architecture proposed consists of 3 different types of modules: The PPC, 'Main Control Process', in charge of receiving the orders that came from whichever user interface (web, SMS, PSTN, and -since HomeOnAir was implemented- WAP) and of dispatching these orders to the appropriate home automation network. There was 1 module to manage each user interface (sending orders from the user to the PPC and receiving answers and status of the home appliances that had to be shown from the PPC to the user). And there was too 1 module to manage each home automation network installed at user's home. In the case of HomeOnAir, the platform can manage Lonworks and X-10 home automation networks. WP3 ('Platform adaptation and service integration'): - Phase 1 software modules adapted/implemented and unitary tests completed. - Operative prototype ready. - Phase 2 platforms components integrated and integration tests completed. The work undertaken in this WP consisted mainly in the adaptation of the existing generic modules of the architecture to accommodate the new one (in charge of the management of the WAP interface). The platform database was re-designed. All modules were deeply tested before integrating the new one. The testing of the whole platform was done in TID laboratories in Madrid and Boecillo, and this phase was very useful to debug errors and refine the functionalities offered by the WAP home services implemented (home control, shopping list, agenda, etc). WP4 ('Trials'): - Trial scenarios and test cases specified. - Technical experimentation completed. Trials were specified to be done in 4 real houses. Nevertheless, during the specification phase the Consortium decided to extend the sample of users by organising in parallel trials in the HomeTalk demonstrators in Boecillo and Madrid. Finally experimentation with HomeOnAir services was done in 4 homes and in the demonstrator of Boecillo. WP5 ('Measurement and evaluation of results'): - Optimum platform performance. - Service evaluation by the users completed. The experimentation was guided by the Human Factors department of TID, in charge of the collection of log files (objective measurements of use) and the questionnaires the users fulfilled periodically (subjective measurements on HomeOnAir usability, usefulness and general satisfaction). Results shown that security related services were the most appealing for the users (by security we mean reactive actions from the home when a technical alarm occurred; the platform notified the user via SMS and performed the appropriate actions to palliate the harmful consequences of the dangerous situation (water leakage, gas leakage, fire detection, intrusion detection, etc). Following security services, comfort related services were also well accepted by the users (remote operation of the lights, switching on-off of the heating, remote opening of the front door when a relative tries to enter, etc). In general, HomeOnAir services evaluated during the trials phase were evaluated as satisfactory, the WAP interface was valued as very easy to use and the only concern in adopting the services was price. Users are willing to pay for being notified when there is an abnormality at home but are more reticent to pay to check whether the home appliances are in the desired state (on-off) or to operate over them.

107,194445,Yes,Smarter Grid: Empowering SG Market Actors through Information and Communication Technologies,"Power systems undergo massive technological changes due to the ever increasing concerns for environmental and energy sustainability. The increase of RES and DG penetration is one of the main goals in Europe in order to meet the environmental targets. However these goals will require new business cases and must be based on innovative ICT tools and communication infrastructure. On parallel, following the M/490 EU Mandate, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI proposed a technical report describing the Smart Grid Reference Architecture and the Smart Grids Architecture Model (SGAM) framework. A key objective of new Research and Innovation projects should be to provide solutions and ICT tools compatible with the SGAM and the standardization activity in Europe. Such new projects should also support the standardization activity by proposing additions or changes related to their objectives. Another key issue to address is whether the existing telecommunication infrastructure is sufficient to support in mass scale the new business cases and Smart Grid services. SmarterEMC2 implements ICT tools that support Customer Side Participation and RES integration, and facilitate open access in the electricity market. These tools take into account the SGAM as well the future structure of the Distribution Network as described by the relevant EU bodies and organizations. The project supports standardization activity by proposing adaptation to data models of market-oriented standards (IEC 62325-351) and field level standards (IEC 61850). Moreover, the project is fully dedicated towards achieving a maximum of impact. To validate the proposed technologies, the project includes 3 real-world pilots and large-scale simulation in 3 laboratories. The former will demonstrate the impact of Demand Response and Virtual Power Plants services in the real world settings, while the latter will reveal the ability of the communication networks to support massive uptake of such services.",1,1
602,14419,No,Composite Broadband Interworking and End-to-End Models,"COMBlNE investigates the interworking of ATM-based broadband networks with other networks foreseen to be present in future scenarios. Therefore COMBlNE's primary objective is to create a conceptual and technological foundation to enable separated broadband islands to work together in providing broadband services, including connectionless data service.   In particular COMBINE will specify interworking strategies with respect to quality of service, level of interworking, routing, addressing, resource allocation and management. The interworking strategy will be validated through design, development and demonstration of heterogeneous networks, functioning on a selected testbed. The objective of the research was to investigate the interworking of asynchronous transfer node (ATM) based broadband networks with other networks foreseen in future scenarios. Therefore the primary objective was to create a conceptual and technological foundation to enable separated broadband islands to work together in providing broadband services, including a connectionless data service.  In particular it was necessary to specify interworking strategies with respect to quality of service, level of interworking, routing, addressing, resource allocation and management. The interworking strategy is validated through design, development and demonstration of heterogeneous networks, functioning on a selected testbed.  The research has resulted in the following: the modelling of the different network elements has been completed; the first analysis of the ATM DQDB interworking unit (IWU) functions has resulted in a draft IWU specification based on a defined reference configuration; different protocol mappings have been investigated; hardware and software reference configurations have been developed; network environments including ATM, distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) metropolitan area network (MAN), local area networks (LAN) such as Ethernet, fibre distributed data interface (FDDI) and Token Ring, and Frame Relay have been analyzed.  A simulation tool has been developed to help the network designer to identity the optimum network design parameters for a heterogenous network environment. The tool consists of 2 parts: simulation modules and a user interface. The simulation modules are created using enhancements of an asynchronous, event driven C-function library to enable the simulation of heterogeneous scenarios. The user interface helps the user to create the design of the network to be simulated. The interface has been generated using an object oriented C\\ function library. By this modular concept of simulation modules and user interface the optimum network can be found without much knowledge of the underlying simulation details.  A high performance interworking unit (IWU) has been designed and implemented for up to 155 Mbps between asynchronous transmission (ATM) and distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) which supports the direct provision of connectionless service as well as indirect provision and isochronous service. THE IWU processes all user plane cells or slots in such a way that incoming cells are converted into outgoing slots (and vice versa) in a cell by cell manner (on the fly). Segmentation and reassembling of datagrams is not necessary. This leads to a very low delay of some 20 us and high throughput of 365000 messages per second.  An asynchronous transmission (ATM) distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) interworking unit, has been designed and implemented. The global management consists of the configuration, performance and fault management of the interworking unit (IWU). A graphical human machine interface to allow a friendly interaction with the IWU operator has also been implemented. The communication aspects between the global management and the human machine interface as well as the communication between the global management and the layer management have been examined. Technical Approach   Based on identified interworking requirements, existing and future protocols, important features are extracted in order to show the generic nature of Inter-Working Units (IWUs). Translation of protocol stacks is considered. Different IWU parameter sets are analysed.   Protocols and networks have been modelled and a mathematical and stochastic analysis of the models is developed for performance analysis and IWU optimisation.   An IWU with a Connectionless Broadband Data Server (CBDS) interface is specified. The IWU is designed and integrated in a testbed with connection to a CBDS server. Traffic experiments will be set up during January-April 1995 to validate the proposed interworking strategies.   Key Issues   The project addresses the key functional requirements in establishing high performance interworking in heterogeneous broadband networks. Both conceptual and implementation aspects of interworking are considered.   Expected Impact   This project should indicate how optimal interworking between broadband networks can be realised.   The availability of the IWU component could trigger integration of different broadband networks, especially in providing high-speed connectionless services over large geographical areas (e.g. ATM to LAN/MAN interconnect).",0,0
167,47512,Yes,"Corporate governance,innovation and economic performance in the EU","The objective of this project is to make the analysis of the innovative enterprise central to current debates on corporate governance.   Corporate govemance is concerned with the institutions that influence the ways in which business corporations allocate resources and returns. Corporate govemance is important for business enterprises because it both enables and proscribes strategic decisions concerning the types of investments they should make and to whom the returns on these investments should be distributed. Corporate govemance is also important for national economies, and for the EU, because of the important role of corporations in the allocation of resources and retums on national and international levels. Within the EU many different national systems of corporate govemance prevail, but both European integration and globalization are creating pressures toward convergence to an ideal corporate govemance system. An understanding of the relation between corporate govemance and economic performance is therefore of profound importance to the evolution of the EU.   The broad goal of this project is to enhance our understanding of the relation between systems of corporate govemance and economic performance among the nations of the EU. The specific objectives of this project are: - to analyze how prevailing systems of corporate govemance in EU nations influe the investment strategies and the distribution of corporate revenues of industrial corporations based in those nations; - to compare the influence of corporate govemance on corporate investment strategy and revenue distribution among EU nations and with the United States and Japan; - to deterime the extent to which increasing intemational competition and intergenerational dependence are creating pressures on national systems of corporate govemance that will affect the incentives and abilities of corporatio to invest in innovation and contribute to an equitable distribution of income; - to elaborate the policy implications of the analysis of comparative corporate governance for economic growth, employment opportunities, and income distributi in the EU.

Manycores will benefit tremendously from 3-dimensional (3D) integration technology that enables distribution in space of computational and storage functions to achieve unprecedented performance levels.PROD3D is an ambitious high risk and high reward project that builds upon existing European world-class R&D expertise of the partners. PRO3D will innovate in both hardware and software technologies and demonstrate the effectiveness of manycores by an integrated and concerted effort in key aspects of hardware and software design. The uniqueness of this proposal stems from the experience of the partners in various aspects of manycore design that need to be addressed concurrently.The key outcome of PRO3D will be a holistic system design methodology to bring a drastic improvement of productivity to reduce cost development and time to market for future embedded computing. In particular, PROD3D will: i) develop a system software flow that can operate transparently on parallel manycore platforms; ii) develop formal methods for software design guaranteeing the composability and correct operation of both Hardware and software; iii) explore the impact of 3D integration for new computing architectures iv) Extend the software-flow to 3D-stacked manycores.The PRO3D consortium brings together world-class leaders in their own field with competencies to cover software, architecture and 3D integration. One of the key differentiators of the PRO3D consortium is its access to an industrial many core System on Chip, named 'Platform 2012' and provided by STM.

As our globally-connected digital civilization increasingly relies on its smooth operation any disruption has a direct negative impact on both the economy and society. However, the Internet was not designed to serve its current role nor was foreseen to be a public good. On the contrary, it was designed to be fully decentralized and thus administrated by the owners of independent networks. Today, the various Internet players have diverse and often conflicting objectives. Indeed, the tussle between Internet players or between them and governments hit the news and the negative externalities affect the life of potentially billions of Internet users worldwide and harm innovation in the Internet.  We propose a research agenda to resolve the tussle in the Internet. First, we propose the use of sophisticated techniques to collect and analyze massive network data to unveil the complex interactions among the various Internet players that lead to disputes and to identify the conditions under which conditions a resolution is possible. Second, we utilize additional degrees of freedom to resolve the tussle in the Internet by enabling coordination of the various Internet players. To this end, we introduce expressiveness of all the involved parties in existing and emerging protocols and enable agile deployment of third-party services and applications inside operational networks. Third, we contribute to the Internet policy making debate by providing an unbiased view of the state and health of the Internet as well as providing recommendations on how to resolve the Internet tussle. This is an interdisciplinary effort to foster a dialogue for Internet's future and sustainability in light of its ever-increasing growth and competitiveness.",0,1
630,208617,No,Functional dissection of core spliceosomal mutations causing Retinitis Pigmentosa.,"More than 95% of human genes undergo pre-mRNA splicing, and alternative splicing of mRNA precursors represents a prevalent mode of gene regulation. Errors in this process are often the origin of of disorders. Most of splicing-related diseases are caused by perturbation in pre-mRNA transcripts which lead to their aberrant processing. Interestingly, a fraction of mutations affecting directly splicing factors, including core spliceosomal components, has been linked to a group of pathologies. Particularly intriguing are variants of the key spliceosomal subcomplex U4/5/6 tri-snRNP, associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa. Why these mutations lead to highly tissue-specific phenotypes, rather than general toxicity cause by a global block in splicing, remain unexplained. The proposed research aims to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these mutations and shed light on the basis of the disease. To functionally dissect these variants, I will combine spliceosomal network approaches (I) with genome-wide transcriptome analysis (II) and detailed biochemical and structural studies (III). Mechanistic insights derived from these analyses will help to identify transcripts that are predominantly sensitive to these mutations and that could be behind their pathogenic effects (IV). This work will allow us to better understand the function of key splicing factors, as well as the basis for their effects on splice site selection and their contributions to Retinitis Pigmentosa pathology.",0,0
466,212592,No,Deciphering Regulatory DNA and Transcription Factor Binding Sites in C3 and C4 Species with Varying Water Use Efficiencies,"Water-related stress is the number one limiting factor for plant productivity and human well-being. One-third of the current world population faces water shortages and by 2025, two-thirds are expected to experience water stress conditions, i.e 1.8 billion people will be subjected to absolute water scarcity. The C4 photosynthetic pathway boosts plant productivity by ~50% but also increases water use efficiency. C4 photosynthesis is a remarkable trait that is thought to have evolved in response to environmental factors including increased aridity and seasonality. All C4 plants concentrate CO2 in leaves, increasing productivity by ~50%, but also maintaining lower stomatal conductance than C3 species. For example, under heat stress induced by a temperature rise from 20°C to 30°C, C3 plants double water loss via transpiration whilst C4 plants are able to decrease the diffusive efflux of water vapour by 50%, and are therefore considered as water-efficient users.  A fuller understanding of C4 photosynthesis would facilitate water efficient and productive crops to be engineered in the future. In this programme the researcher will become familiar with state-of-the-art, genome-wide approaches that are used and operational in the host laboratory to better understand the genetic basis of C4 photosynthesis. Specifically regions of the rice and sorghum genomes that are bound by transcription factors as leaves develop will be determined. These data will be interrogated to test the hypothesis that genes of the C4 pathway evolved to become induced by light in C4 leaves. Secondly, transcription factor footprints associated with genes expressed in M or BS cells of sorghum will be identified. These footprints (DNA sequences) will test the hypothesis that multiple genes preferentially expressed in M or BS cells are regulated by the same cis-elements.",0,0
512,55063,No,Smart Antenna Technology in Universal bRoadband wireless Networks,"The ability of smart antennas to increase the capacity of circuit-switched cellular mobile radio systems is well understood by the communications industry, however smart antennas can also enhance packet-switched performance and provide value-added services in other wireless applications: * Enhanced diversity and fading migration in Local and Campus wireless networks * Provision of location information in mobile networks smart antennas can additionally offer fading countermeasures through the deployment of arrays at both the transmit and receive nodes (Multiple-input Multiple-output architectures). The SATURN project proposes to address the above issues and, by identifying architectural commonalities amongst the various application areas, contribute towards the development of re-configurable radio systems and networks.  Objectives: Recent research addressing SMART antenna technology has recognised the significance of advanced diversity methods.  In UMTS transmit diversity schemes using cross-polarised antennas will be analysed in this project.  At the same time, the potential benefits of using smart antenna technology to increase the bit rate capacity of a fading channel will be exploited in applications other than cellular mobile radio, such as wireless local and campus area networks using HIPERLAN technology.  In addition, a new application of smart antenna technology has emerged from the growing interest in location based services. Array processing technology will be used to enhance the mobile location function, particularly in areas where triangulation between several base-stations is problematic.  The SATURN project is designed to address these issues, with the following objectives:  To promote enhanced availability of high bit rate wireless services with the use of smart antennas for mixed tele-traffic scenarios. This means making services available to more people, more of the time at higher speeds (mobility/location), and/or at greater ranges.  To consider how smart antennas can provide enhanced location information  Work description: The objectives will be met by theoretical investigation, simulation and experimental validation for three types of wireless networks, characterised by different requirements on mobility, bit rate, and, partly, types of services:  Outdoor high bit rate (UMTS-based) networks  Local and wide area networks  The investigation will deal with the classical advantages of introducing smart antennas: range extension, capacity increase, interference reduction. The impact on the physical, MAC, link and network layers will be assessed for several types of traffic, in particular connectionless packet data.  Advanced MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) array diversity techniques, which use array antennas both at the remote and at the base station, will be analysed. An investigation for the synthesis of pertinent access techniques for packet data traffic will be carried out.  The potential of array processing to provide enhanced location information will be investigated for UMTS-based outdoor broadband networks.  Key Issues: Smart Antennas Wireless Broadband Networks Local and Wide Area Wireless Networks UMTS Location Information in UMTS Networks  Expected Impact  By using antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver a MIMO fading channel is created resulting in marked increase in channel capacity.

703,111035,No,Frictions in the Financial System,"'The financial crisis, since its start in 2008 has exposed enormous fractures both in the financial architecture and in the structure of the global economy. Although with some notable exceptions, the magnitude of the events caught the finance profession largely by surprise. Clearly, we have to understand better the institutional mechanism channeling savings towards the best uses of capital, and to what extent this mechanism can sometimes fail. The projects in this proposal will push the boundaries of our knowledge in this direction. I suggest a dual approach to achieve this goal. First, we have to improve our understanding of which frictions are the crucial impediments of the efficient functioning of markets. As this approach focuses on particular markets in isolation, I call this the micro approach. I propose three projects within this approach: trading and information diffusion in OTC markets, the crowdedness in limits-to-arbitrage, and the interaction of political uncertainty and sovereign bond prices. Second, from the frictions emerging from the micro approach, we have to select the ones which determine the aggregate liquidity fluctuations in the economy. I use this concept in a broad sense; referring to the changing efficiency with which the financial system allocates resources across investment opportunities. As this approach focuses on the functionality of the financial system as a whole, I call this the macro approach.  I propose two projects within this approach. The first project focuses on the determinants of the differences in the financial architecture of different economies. It builds a novel framework to study the dynamics of the financial sector of an economy. The second project studies the role of shadow banking in the fluctuation of aggregate liquidity. In particular, this project concentrates on the fluctuation of the efficiency of private liquidity creation as the state of the economy changes.'",0,0

The development of MEMS based millimetre wave modules and their assembly to antenna front-end prototypes with redundancy power routing (space application) or phased array antenna feeding (automotive) will demonstrate the enormous innovative potential of MEMS technology in the millimetre wave range. In order to ensure the possible widespread of these RF MEMS based components into commercial products, packaging and reliability issues will be specifically addressed. The MIPA consortium comprises leading European companies in microwave product development and microsystems technology with expertise in wafer fabrication, packaging, reliability assessment and commercial exploitation.  Objectives: The main objective of the MIPA project is to make millimetre wave microsystems available for their commercial use in broadband satellite data links in the Q band (40/50 GHz) and in future generations of car radar systems working at 77 GHz. Sub-objectives stands for: *Design and modelling of RF MEMS switches for application at 50 and 77 GHz *Development of MEMS based process to implement these RF MEMS switches *Design and development of MEMS based beam forming network for application at 77 GHz *Design and development of antenna arrays at 50/77 GHz on appropriate substrates *Development and implementation of dedicated packaging for the RF MEMS components *Design and implementation of prototypes for applications in phased array antenna for automotive radar and in focal array fed reflector for telecommunication  Work description: MIPA starts with the specification of MEMS devices and MEMS based sub-modules such as redundancy switches, phase shifting devices, power routing networks. Also the specification of the assembly of these devices and modules to a space and an automotive prototype for operation at 50-GHz and 77-GHz, respectively, is immediately addressed. One main part of the work is the design of these devices by using electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical simulation tools to serve the wafer processing with layouts and important technology related information. The wafer processing deals with the microfabrication of single MEMS switches themselves, their monolithic integration to yield more complex on-wafer sub-modules as phase shifters or routing networks. It comprises the fabrication of on-wafer matching and bias structures and other passive components. Therefore, a lot of technology work and technology development in the microsystems area will be done during the wafer processing. With regard to the strong requirements in the space and automotive industrial sector, the work related to packaging and hermetic sealing of MEMS based sub-modules (to protect them against an impairment through environmental conditions) will constitute the largest part of the MIPA work. Especially the performance of the devices at the envisaged frequencies for operation (50 and 77-GHz) after their packaging must be investigated in depth. To exploit MEMS devices for millimetre wave applications, their reliability under all possible conditions must be known. Therefore, much effort will be spend on the determination of the long-time behaviour (both mechanical and electrical) of millimetre wave MEMS in order to identify weak points in the technology and fabrication process flow. This will be done with special regard to space and automotive conditions (vibration, temperature, humidity, etc.). For the demonstration of the tremendous potential of MEMS at millimetre wave frequencies, MEMS based antenna front-ends will be developed and characterised, one for a 50-GHz space communications system and one for a 77-GHz car radar. This work will be supported with the development of other millimetre wave components as e.g. array antennas, to build MEMS based integrated phased array prototypes.

Following the market needs for customization, non-standard containers are increasing and posing new challenges for quality controls. Current technologies are limited to examine standard shapes and specialized per type of defects causing false positives phenomena, increasing production costs and slowing-down times. Video Systems aims to develop an innovative inspection system for the cold-end and the reselection phase, APICUS, with no comparable solution. It is a collaborative robot, empowered by artificial intelligence and artificial vision, able to handle a glass article in a human-like way and detect all potential defects, cutting down false positives to 0.1% and speeding up processes.

758,8731,No,European Distributed System Integration Project,"The move towards decentralised information processing has highlighted the need for interworking distributed applications platforms across heterogeneous hardware and software systems. A common platform would achieve this by providing an interface between specific distributed applications and the underlying software and hardware. Such an interface would allow applications to run in a multivendor environment on different machines across different interconnected systems.   Amongst the most notable initiatives aiming at the availability of such a platform are the ECMA SE-ODP standardisation and work undertaken under the aegis of the CEC. The sheer size of the effort required to define and implement such a distributed application platform means that multiple steps are required: the HARNESS project is the next step.   HARNESS aimed to integrate the results of various ESPRIT and other projects into a Common Distributed Application Platform supporting the execution of distributed applications on various heterogeneous hardware products, so enabling interworking to be achieved. It used standard components. To ensure that the platform is competitive and meet market expectations, existing and emergent standards will form its basis wherever possible. The move towards decentralized information processing has highlighted the need for interworking across heterogenous environments. Several basic distributed platforms have been implemented, both in ESPRIT and elsewhere. European distributed system integrated project (HARNESS) is capitalizing on these developments by integrating 2 of these approaches (ISA and COMANDOS) into a single integrated distributed application platform capable of spanning multiple underlying hardware and software systems.  The HARNESS applications platform is applicable by users of multiple computer systems, supporting different operating systems. They are typically the environments in which users need to access services throughout the computer network, without worrying about physical location of such services. Typical examples are the cooperative development of software systems, and the linking of multiple departments to optimize the flow of information (such as in a typical production chain: sales, production planning, production scheduling, purchase of raw materials, expedition, administration).  HARNESS has delivered specifications for the distributed application platform. Based on these specifications, the implementation of the distributed applications platform is in an advanced stage. The development of the various tools and application to be adapted to HARNESS is well under way. HARNESS first defined the platform specification, taking into account both user requirements and the availability of components: it is based on the consortium's experience and an in-depth survey of both the needs and positions of the various actors (users, hardware manufacturers and software houses) and the current state of the art.   The platform is defined by a set of interfaces to application programs and implemented as one or more layers on top of the different systems and networks. It is based on the integration of the best available technology using different European hardware platforms. To allow reuse of results from other platform projects, its implementation is based on Unix systems. The platform is intended to be readily adaptable for use on other operating systems. HARNESS placed strong emphasis on capabilities for allowing new components to be integrated later while keeping the same interface, thus allowing the platform to evolve.   To ensure usability, different sets of tools has been integrated in the platform software package for management and the development of applications. The platform was demonstrated and used to support applications which both lend themselves to distributed implementation and have complex requirements. It was thus possible to assess the effort needed to migrate from existing industrial practice onto HARNESS as well as the costs and benefits of the platform itself.   The HARNESS project aimed to establish a strong relationship between users, providers of the platform and of services mounted on it, other European projects, and standardisation organisations. This relationship is used in the further definition and dissemination of the platform as it evolves.",0,0

The need to improve air quality in European Countries has been identified as a major requirement to be achieved within the next decade in the effort to control climate change, a key Europe 2020 strategy, and to improve human health. Despite vigorous efforts to reduce levels of hazardous substances in the air, targets remain a challenge. One of the most valid sustainable technologies explored so far is photocatalytic concrete. This technology is proven to reduce the amount of hazardous air pollutants up to 80 % . It also imparts self-cleaning properties to built structures which has a secondary effect of reducing harsh cleaning chemicals entering the water systems. However, the titanium oxide based photocatalytic building materials are activated by ultraviolet light so, to date, such environmental benefits are limited to countries with a high incidence of sunlight.

OBJECTIVES The objectives of the project are: - To take into consideration the multidisciplinary nature of the problem and to develop cooperative research in three main directions: computational geometry, computer algebra and numerical analysis; - To give Effective Computational Geometry for Curves and Surfaces solid mathematical and algorithmic foundations, to provide solutions to key problems and to validate our theoretical advances through extensive experimental research and the development of software packages that could serve as steps towards a standard for safe and effective geometric computing; - To promote collaborative research, the interchange between the partners (workshops), exchanges of Ph.D. students and research staff; - To disseminate our results through research reports, open source softwares, software packages and through a program of open activities including summer-schools and advanced courses intended to academia and industry.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK This project is focused on effectively handling curved objects. Many application domains ranging from engineering to medicine have a demand for computer models of physical objects that are curved, moving and deformable. Our research will be guided by four different main aspects: - Geometric algorithms for curves and surfaces. We intend to revisit the field of Computational Geometry in order to understand how structures that are well known for linear objects behave when defined on curves and surfaces; - Algebraic issues. Several operations on non-linear geometric objects, often lying at the algorithm's bottleneck, are equivalent to manipulating polynomials. A fundamental question is the solution of algebraic systems, ubiquitous in the construction of new objects, such as intersections. Another crucial goal is the implementation of primitives with Boolean or discrete output, such as an object is contained in some bounding object; - Robustness issues. Geometric programs are notorious for their non-robustness: algorithms are designed for a model of computation where real numbers are dealt with exactly geometric algorithms are frequently only formulated for inputs in general position. This is not simply and academic problem. It is easy to crash any commercial CAD-system. Progress has been made only in recent years. A significant part of the progress was made by the proposers and centres around the so-called exact computation paradigm. We will extend this paradigm to curved objects; - Approximating curves and surfaces. Since algorithms for curves and surfaces are more involved, more difficult to make robust and typically several orders of magnitude slower than their linear counterparts, there is a need for approximate representations. We will provide robust and quality guaranteed approximations of curves and surfaces. Such a research program requires a multidisciplinary approach and our consortium will gather expertise from Computational Geometry and other areas in mathematics and computer science such a computer arithmetic, computer algebra and numerical analysis.",0,0
177,63042,Yes,Federating a Packaging and Interconnection Transeuropean Industrial Activity,"PATRIA is a study/accompanying measure, harmonising with the objectives of the IST programme and providing clear European added value, by paving the way for the resurgence of industrial scale advanced packaging and interconnection services in Europe, targeting very advanced technologies, in closeness to European semiconductor manufacturers, smart card industry and MEMS facilities. Critical factors and determinants with respect to feasibility of prospects to regain such economic activities, today lost to Asian competition, will be assessed. Outcome of the study will be a plan for business opportunities for a federated and incubated start up enterprise, reflecting up-to-date and emerging developments in technology and markets, attracting and federating industrial users, entrepreneurs, and investors. This leads into the diplomatic effort of PATRIA to identify, motivate and - to some degree - organise all relevant stakeholders who play a role in this effort by establishment of a Business Initiative Group (BIG.).  Objectives: The global aim of this study is to pave the way for the resurgence of industrial scale advanced packaging and interconnection services in Europe targeting very advanced technologies, in closeness to European semiconductor manufacturers, smart card industry and MEMS facilities. The practical objective of PATRIA is to assess the operational feasibility of plans to regain packaging business and industrial activity, today lost to Asian vendors, through the consolidation of a business plan building on emerging operations, attracting and federating industrial users, entrepreneurs and investors. PATRIA will consider a model of federation of the existing operations and incubation of sub-critical initiatives, stemming from the existing research, commercial, industrial, political and governmental resources, in order to allow reaching the critical mass of what is considered as a capital intensive and competitive business. Results will be disseminated to critical stakeholders.  Work description: The workplan of 30,5 man months contains all necessary work elements to address the issues of a plan for business opportunities for the setting up of pan-European incubated packaging and interconnection enterprises. WP1 'Advanced Packaging and Interconnection industrial solutions for the European market' is consolidating the selection of appropriate packaging technologies required for the European industry. It will build on existing material and studies, which will be interpreted in the sense of the creation of a pan-European industrial environment; WP2 'Federating and motivating the European Stakeholders in Packaging & Interconnection in Europe' is federating the European stakeholders e.g. SC, MEMS, smart cards by the creation of a specific High Level Group call the Business Initiative Group, BIG, regrouping the stakeholders of existing and new hot spots in the packaging and interconnection landscape in Europe; WP3 'Factors of success and failure for packaging and interconnection production facilities in Europe' will analyse the elements of success and failure and evaluate recent actions; WP4 'Financial key aspects of industrial, investments' addresses the financial impact considering both investment and running costs as well as necessary seed funding and considerations for break even. The impact of the development of European operations on the cost of supplies will be an important part of this analysis; WP5 'Plan of Business Opportunities for a federated packaging and interconnection industrial environment' is dedicated to the compilation of the business plan, which is the major outcome of the work in PATRIA; WP6 'Validation and implementation' will first validate the plan of business opportunities produced in a draft form with the High Level Group and other European stakeholders in a dedicated workshop and conference. Output from this will allow the refinement of the PATRIA business plan. This part of the work also provides for dissemination measures targeted at specific audiences; WP7 'Management' is reserved for project management during the entire lifetime.  Milestones: PATRIA has three milestones: M1 (month 6) is reached when the industrial basis for a viable European strategy is addressed (WP1), there has been formulated a strategy to federate European stakeholders leading to the successful formation of a high level group (WP2) and all success and failure determinants of existing European players are analysed (WP3); M2 is reached in month 9 with draft of a business plan for a federated incubated European packaging/interconnection enterprise; M3 is reached in month 11 with a PATRIA workshop.",1,1

100,30455,Yes,Advanced MUltimedia SErvices for residential users,"The aim of the AMUSE project is to carry out experiments on the provision of interactive and distributive multimedia services to real residential users (in the order of ten per trial island). Services will be demonstrated in field trials carried out in different islands, using a state-of-the-art end-to-end ATM infrastructure (from Terminal Equipment to Multimedia Server), through various types of Access Networks.  A number of experiments are planned to thoroughly assess both service and technology aspects related to the adopted delivery platforms.

Dissemination of results will further contribute to raising awareness of and demand for advanced communications and services in an area which is strategically important for Europe.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables The project demonstrated the provision of interactive and distributive multimedia services (with support of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 streaming), including fast access to Internet, to real residential users. Services have been demonstrated over an end-to-end ATM infrastructure in 11 field trials which have been carried out in 7 different locations; Basel, Milan, Mons, Munich, Aveiro/Lisbon and Reykjavik. Contribution to the programme The trial results have helped to drive the new strategies for the provisioning of advanced multimedia services. They have shown the way towards a more rapid and effective deployment of broadband technologies. Validation of advanced access network systems prototypes is already impacting products and services.  Technical Approach The project will consist of two phases, each one resulting in demonstrations as follows :  First demonstration phase services supported by switched ATM end-to-end connections ADSL, HFC and FTTC/FTTB access network technologies ADSL upgrade from 4 to 8 Mbit/s downstream and from 64 to 640 kbit/s to allow for higher interactivity and higher quality video low-medium interactivity services supported MPEG1 audio/video; provisioning of Switched Video Broadcasting (SVB), using multicasting capabilities and zapping control  Second demonstration phase extended support of DAVIC 1.0 specs advanced ATM PON access network in the Italian trial and Hybrid Fibre-Radio (HFR) in the German trial more user-friendly and interactive services: Tourist/Cultural Info, Infomercial, Personalised News,...

Summary of Trial User trials involving real residential users are foreseen in the project framework, relying on different national trial islands. Each trial will be characterised by different access network typologies (ADSL, HFC, FTTC/FTTB, ATM PON, HFR), service offerings, categories of users and national regulatory rules and constraints. Key Issues In the service domain, the project plans to: demonstrate the provision of advanced multimedia services to real residential users in a number of different areas: entertainment (e.g. movie on demand, broadcast services), commercial (e.g. home shopping), information (e.g. news on demand), education (e.g. distance learning) thoroughly evaluate the user perception and acceptance of the demonstrated services demonstrate the possibility of offering high quality multimedia services with different levels of interactivity, ranging from no interaction (e.g. broadcast services) to a reasonably high level of interaction (e.g. teleshopping and teleworking) analyse the relationship between Interactive Multimedia and Internet and the possibility of accessing them via different terminal equipment, from PCs to set-top boxes, taking careful consideration of the evolution of the latter towards Network Computing Devices In the delivery platform domain, the project expects to achieve the best overall system solution by addressing the following key issues: effective integration in each trial island of a number of different equipment components supplied by different manufacturers adoption of alternative access network solutions (e.g. ADSL, Hybrid Fibre Coax, ATM Passive Optical Networks) in the different islands good compliance with B-ISDN and emerging DAVIC specifications demonstration of the benefits associated with the adoption of a switched ATM network to offer the flexibility and bandwidth allocation specifically required to support audio-visual and multimedia services viability of the adopted system choices for supporting new services",0,1
646,35499,No,Development plasma technology continuous processing textile fabrics nonwovens plasmatex,"The analytical and experimental work of this project has resulted in following achievements:   1. A book of specifications has been developed containing industrial end-user's commercial process requirements concerning the potential advantages of plasma treatment on textiles and nonwovens.  2. The investigations have been made of experimental plasma systems able to replicate and characterise target industrial processes achieved by low-pressure plasmas. Diagnostic systems for both low-pressure and atmospheric-pressure plasma types have been developed.  3. Transfer to know-how from low-pressure to atmospheric-pressure systems has been made using test materials from the industrial partners. Samples received from the end-users have been treated in low-pressure plasmas and analysed and application tested. Atmospheric-pressure plasma process characterisation has been made of representative samples received from the end-users.  4. Mathematical modelling of the plasma processes for producing the target results have been developed.  5. Milestone M1 has been reached as explained below. Successful processes have been demonstrated in static regime with samples from three and-users, and in dynamic regime with PP fabric at speeds of 4m/min. The materials chosen (PET, PP and cellulose) are representative of the spectrum of fabrics used by all end-users. Treatment in dry air, argon and helium have been successful.  In conclusion, the ability of lab plasma processes to solve target industrial problems has been successfully demonstrated (M1).  6. Milestone M2 has been reached as explained below. Characteristics of successful processes demonstrated in M1 have been well recorded. Plasma fingerprints and data libraries (built during T5 and T6) can be successfully used to simulate processes of M1. The processes of M1 have been well characterised and can be simulated.  7. Milestones M3 and M4 have been reached as explained below. One of a small-scale (10:1 scale) production prototype machine having a flexible and adaptable design and construction has been developed as the result of output from T6, T7 and T8.  There are three stages of the plasma prototype, namely  * The AP-1 'blue box' as seen at Polisilk is a benchtop basic laboratory system for experimental work that has the Mark II power supply plus linear transformer. (Milestone M3) * The AP-10 is entirely manual and also has the Mark II power supply plus linear transformer. However it is a much larger machine and can be integrated with WEB's unwind and rewind. (Milestone M4)  * The AP-100 is a fully automatic machine which has the RF-1000 power supply and fully computerised system control.  The partners have studied the industrial feasibility of atmospheric plasma system technology and conducting full-scale tests to determine the characteristics of different types of plasma in different gases and analyse how atmospheric plasmas interact with types of textiles and nonwovens. The methodology was to transfer experimentally successful low-pressure plasma processes into highly manufacturable plasma regimes, capable of meeting the basic on-line production requirements. Investigations were made by diagnostic fingerprinting and modelling of both low-pressure and atmospheric pressure plasma systems in order to achieve the necessary ingredients in plasmas as a powerful surface engineering tool.  8. The end-users considered it important to proceed quickly with the construction of three plasma prototype machines called AP100. These machines were required to complete the work programme in time.  Three prototypes developed by Plasma Ireland were installed, together with fabric feeding systems developed by partner WEB, and were used by the consortium's industrial partners as well as the research organisations to carry out field testing and to analyse the improvements in the functional properties if various types of test material.  The first prototype in operation at IFP, Sweden, has been made available to the Swedish partner companies SCA, Almedahl and Borgstena for testing the effect of plasma treatment on polyester car upholstery fabrics, wet-laid nonwovens and cotton and cotton-polyester woven fabrics.  The second prototype in operation is used by Kirchhoff in Germany to test the effect of plasma treatment on the anti-felting properties of protein fibre based domestic textiles.  The third prototype in operation is used by Scapa in UK to test the effect of plasma treatment on the functional properties of paper-machinery clothing fabrics.  The research partners IFP and Queen's University have been making extensive studies of the fundamentals of surface modifications on various types of substrates and the diagnostics of the plasmas in different gases. 9. A large number of trials were made on woven, knitted and nonwoven fabrics as well as loose wool on AP100 plasma prototype. The processing variables tested included gas, power, treatment time etc. In many cases, significant improvements in fabric surface properties were registered at longer treatment times, i.e., slow fabric input/output speeds. In other cases the experiments did not show any improvements in some specific properties. It was also noticed that the treatment made on AP100 required unacceptably large quantities of helium gas due to the particular design of the equipment. These results indicated that for a commercially successful application of this newly developed on-line plasma technology, a major modification of the prototype AP100 was needed.  10. As the result of trials made under item 9 a new industrial prototype for on-line atmospheric pressure plasma treatment has been developed by Plasma Ireland. This unit can handle webs fabric width up to 2.2 metres and the treatment of fabrics and webs is made in vertical plasma chambers as compared to horizontal chamber in prototype AP100. This design would ensure longer reaction times at a given fabric speed as well as result in very significant reduction of the gas consumption.  Milestone M5 The final deliverable from Plasma Ireland is a completely new machine model AP2200, which has a number of advantages compared with AP100 model. The new design overcomes previous gas profligacy problems by exploiting the differential densities of helium and air and gas usage at 3-4 litres/min is only 2-3% of what it was before using AP100 model.  The new system has a vertical fabric feed system and will process a wide up to 2200mm width. This configuration will have a total path length and plasma exposure of 3.6 metres. The first machine model AP-2200 will be ready for marketing around September 2000.  Concluding Remarks  The final deliverable of the PlasmaTex project is the design of an industrial plasma prototype called AP-2200. The machinery has been designed and developed based on extensive investigations made by the consortium's industrial partners using three different AP-100 prototypes supplied by Plasma Ireland.  The studies of the industrial feasibility of AP-100 prototype technology showed that the objectives of interaction between plasmas and various textiles and nonwoven materials could only be particially realized. The design of these prototypes and the helium gas distribution was not effective to produce desirable effects at high speeds of on-line production. In those cases where significant improvements in fabric properties were achieved, the speed of fabric feed was very low to be of commercial interest. The large quantity of experimental data obtained by the industrial and scientific partners clearly indicated as to what design modifications were necessary to obtain good results. For example, the increase in residence time for fabrics in the reaction chamber, the reduction of gas consumption by increasing the gas retention in the reaction chamber, the uniform distribution of the surface modification along fabric width, the fabric handling technique were all taken into consideration by Plasma Ireland in the consortium of the final prototype AP-2200.  Unfortunately because of the lack of time it has not been possible to do any field testing on this unit by the industrial partners. Using vacuum plasma technology, it has been demonstrated  for some years now by Partner 1 and researchers elsewhere  how versatile this method is for imparting different  functions to fiber surfaces in dry media, and at low  temperatures. However, the materials treated at a time  consists of specimens of very small size and weights in  the region of up to 10 g. None of the above processes,  however, have been translated from the laboratory into  industrial production due to fundamental limitations in  the plasma reactor systems used for the experimentation.  Despite the proven capacity and flexibility of plasma  technology in the laboratory environment and despite very  significant market potentials, no viable commercially  available machinery is available for industrial  processing of fabrics.  The objective of this work is:   To realize the potential of plasma based processing for  textiles and nonwovens manufacture by putting in place  prototype plasma facilities (equipment plus processes)  offering a new fabric and nonwoven manufacturing strategy  which replaces costly and environmentally harmful  conventional processing and provides a powerful tool for  product development and innovation based on a flexible  and generic surface engineering capacity.   To transfer experimentally successful plasma processes  into highly manufacturable plasma regimes inherently  capable of meeting basic on line process requirements  including open perimeter equipment with high speed  continuous roll to roll treatment capacity of wide fabric  webs.  The duration of the project is three years. It will  proceed in five stages:  1) Produce laboratory scale solutions, probably at low  pressures, to industrial problems of end use partners  (Partner 1).  2) Characterize and model processes of I) i.e., plasma  processes and plasma surface processes (Partner 10).  3) Transfer such processes to 'manufacturable' plasma  regimes, probably at atmospheric pressures (Partner 2).  4) Build prototypes able to run process of III) (Partner  3) and  5) Apply prototypes to simulated production of textiles  and nonwovens (Partners 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).  The partnership consists of one textile research unit  (Partner 1), one plasma physics research unit (Partner  10), one plasma equipment manufacturer (Partner 2), one  textile machinery manufacturer (Partner 3) and six  textiles and nonwoven producers as end users representing  six different application areas (Partners 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  and 9).  The impact of this project will be to provide textile and  nonwovens industries with economically and  environmentally sound plasma treatments which can be used  for producing textile and nonwoven products with unique  physical, chemical, mechanical and surface properties.",0,0

921,106775,No,Assembling Langmuir-Blodgett Architectures Through the use of Roll-to-roll Systems,"'The proposal addresses each of the three elements of the so-called 'knowledge triangle', i.e. research, innovation and education. The proposed programme is based partly on nationally funded multidisciplinary (Photonics, Nanoelectronics, Chemistry, Materials Science) projects that have been recently awarded to the partners from Academia and is designed to provide added value from the obvious synergies between these projects. The complementarity will enable the consortium to develop novel products using SiO2/TiO2 nanoparticles for improving the properties of solar cells and OLEDs/ OFETs that the first SME partner aims to bring into production. The equipment innovation comes from the planned systematic modifications and improvements to both hardware and software and improvement to both hardware and software of a roll-to-roll Langmuir-Blodgett dipper mechanism that has been developed by the second SME partner. We aim at making the final device attractive for potential customers by modifying the existing prototype so that it is compatible with other equipment (LB troughs) aleady available on the market. The educational and training value of the project is also high in that a number of secondments of research personnel are envisaged, including PhD students. The enhanced commercial opportunities of the device will give the research community direct means of preparing complex photonic and nanoelectronic structures on flexible substrates using a wide range of materials. The innovative roll-to-roll (R2R) mechanism will therefore facilitate the possibility of using the LB technique in a range of new commercially scalable production processes, enabling us to take this technology out of the laboratory and into the factory environment - which will be a truly revolutionary accomplishment and one which is directly aligned with EU requirements.'",0,0
259,80709,No,Ambient Networks Phase 2,"The future wireless world will be filled by a multitude of user devices, and wireless technologies. Simple-to-use, anytime-anywhere network access affordable for everyone is an undisputed must for the eSociety, where the user will expect a rich set of communication services independently of the access used. Devising technologies for true Plug-and-Play networking, efficient use of all infrastructure investments and access competition are the key technical challenges to achieve this vision.  The Ambient Networks project is addressing these challenges by developing innovative mobile network solutions for increased competition and cooperation in an environment with a multitude of access technologies, network operators and business actors. It offers a complete, coherent wireless network solution based on dynamic composition of networks that provide access to any network through the instant establishment of inter-network agreements. The concept offers common control functions to a wide range of different applications and access technologies, enabling the integrated, scalable and transparent control of network capabilities.  The project has three phases. Phase 1 has established the overall approach and developed innovative technical concepts. Phase 2 will prove their viability through implementation, integration, measurements and performance evaluation, enabling concurrent standardisation. The planned effort of approximately 2400 person-months reflects the strategic and technical ambitions of Ambient Networks during its second phase.  Ambient Networks brings together a strong industry-led consortium of the leading operators, vendors, SMEs and research organisations, with the determination, skills and critical mass to create cross-industry consensus for mobile and wireless systems beyond 3G.

714,30511,No,Photonic technologies for ultra high speed information highways,"HIGHWAY addresses promising ultra-high speed optoelectronic components and subsystem technologies for photonic 40 Gbit/s time division multiplexed (TDM) transport systems. Advanced TDM system lab demonstrators are to be realised and tested over field-installed fibre. The field experiments aim to demonstrate that the 40 Gbit/s TDM system technologies developed offer promising options for a field deployment of high capacity information highways in future trans-European telecommunication networks. HIGHWAY will further test and optimise the options of high speed optoelectronic components and subsystems in the 40 Gbit/s system test beds, and finally implement the most promising versions in 40 Gbit/s OTDM/ETDM laboratory system demonstrators for evaluation. Advanced 40 Gbit/s TDM system demonstrator configurations will be operated over different field fibre infrastructures provided by the telecom partners. The 40 Gbit/s system field experiments will allow the testing of alternative options for dispersion accommodation (e.g. MSSI, DCF) over standard fibre infrastructure, and of specific system configurations over different types of fibre links (SSMF, DSF, DFF). Expected Impact The current dynamic market growth for high speed interoffice networks (e.g. in the US) is characterised by strong competition between equipment suppliers offering wavelength-division-multiplexed (n x 2.5 Gbit/s WDM) systems, and those offering the new generation of TDM (10 Gbit/s) transport systems (e.g. OC-192). The same competition will arise with respect to the next bit rate hierarchy (n x 10 Gbit/s WDM vs. 40 Gbit/s TDM). Since future WDM networks will always be based on a mature generation of TDM systems, it is essential to demonstrate the technological capabilities and constraints of state-of-the-art TDM technology. HIGHWAY aims to demonstrate the potential of the next generation of TDM systems (40 Gbit/s) in order to provide a solid technological base for techno-economic decisions by network operators, about cost effective transport systems at the beginning of the next decade. The upgrade of single optical channel transmission capacity to 40 Gbit/s TDM is a challenging task at the limits of existing technologies. OTDM allows for an early investigation of most of the system related limitations associated with 40 Gbit/s RZ transmission over long-haul fibre links (e.g. dispersion accommodation, polarisation-mode dispersion, nonlinearities). However, it is likely that in the near to medium term, advances in high speed electronic circuit design will allow 40 Gbit/s electronic processing. Therefore, it is an important objective of HIGHWAY to provide electronic test circuits (mux/demux) for 40 Gbit/s ETDM and novel ultra-high speed (40 Gbit/s) optoelectronic components and subsystems in order to use the most efficient combination of photonics and electronics for next generation TDM systems. The 40 Gbit/s single optical channel transmission tests should demonstrate the potential of advanced TDM system technologies for high-capacity point-to-point transport. The 40 Gbit/s field tests should answer the important question of whether future ultra-high bit rate systems could be operated over existing fibre infrastructure (SSMF), or if new types of fibre (e.g. DSF) are required. Finally the field trials should demonstrate the potential and implications of optical and electrical TDM system technologies with respect to future TDM/WDM based transparent photonic networks.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Long distance, high speed single wavelength transmission at 40 and 80 GBit/s over standard in-field installed telecommunications optical-fibre, accomodating the PMD.

Technical Approach The consortium aims to develop and demonstrate advanced photonic and electronic components and subsystems for 40 Gbit/s TDM-based optical transport systems, including integrated laser sources, electro-absorption (EA) and travelling wave Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulators, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) for non-linear signal processing (mid-span-spectral-inversion (MSSI), add-and-drop), optical demultiplexers with low polarisation dependence, high speed PIN detectors with integrated SOA preamplifier, and high speed electronic circuits. The components, subsystems and devices will be tested and optimised in 40 Gbit/s testbeds and integrated into 40 Gbit/s system laboratory demonstrators using optical TDM (OTDM) and electrical TDM (ETDM) to prove the key functionalities, benefits and implications of TDM-based photonic transport networks (e.g. high capacity point-to-point transport, add-and-drop multiplexing (ADM)). The subsystem/system tests will also allow evaluation of the potential and optimum combinations of advanced photonic and electronic high speed system technologies (e.g. OTDM vs. ETDM). Summary of Trial 40 Gbit/s TDM system demonstrators will be tested in the field, in fibre testbeds provided by two of the participating telecom operators. BT's East Anglian Network will be used for 40 Gbit/s field testing with dispersion compensation by mid-span-spectral-inversion (MSSI) over existing standard fibre links (Norwich-Ipswich). DT's Berlin FZ fibre testbed offers all possible options of existing or future fibre infrastructure for 40 Gbit/s system field testing, including standard (non-dispersion-shifted) single-mode fibre (SSMF), dispersion-shifted fibre (DSF), and dispersion flattened fibre (DFF). Key Issues 40 Gbit/s system design and building blocks (e.g. transmitter, mux/demux, fibre link, receiver, ADM); Components and subsystems for optical 40 Gbit/s signal generation, mux/demux and detection; Dispersion accommodation techniques (e.g. MSSI) and the impact on fibre infrastructure (SSMF vs. DSF); Basic limitations for 40 Gbit/s transport, e.g. chromatic dispersion, polarisation mode dispersion (PMD); Linear vs. non-linear 40 Gbit/s transmission regime (non-soliton vs. soliton); Signal modulation format (RZ vs. NRZ); 4x10 Gbit/s multiplexing/demultiplexing (OTDM vs. ETDM); Add-and-drop multiplexing; High sensitivity 40 Gbit/s signal detection (optical preamplifier); Supporting high speed technologies (e.g. high speed integrated circuits). Achievements HIGHWAY has so far achieved substantial progress with respect to component/subsystem development, subsystem/system functional tests, 40 Gbit/s transmission tests and the definition and preparation of field test infrastructures.  All basic system functionalities for 40 Gbit/s TDM transport have been demonstrated using the above-mentioned elements, including RZ signal generation, 40 Gbit/s (4x10 Gbit/s) pattern generation and modulation, 4x10 Gbit/s, 2x20 Gbit/s OTDM multiplexing, 10/20 GHz clock recovery from 40 Gbit/s, 40/10 Gbit/s optical demultiplexing, 10/40 Gbit/s ADM, 10/20 Gbit/s detection, 40 Gbit/s dispersion accommodation (MSSI); 40 Gbit/s (4x10 Gbit/s) transmission experiments over SSMF and DSF have been performed successfully, including clock extraction and BER measurements. 40 Gbit/s has been transmitted over up to 400 km of SSMF using MSSI for dispersion accommodation. These laboratory experiments have confirmed the viability of the proposed options; Theoretical models for the evaluation of basic system limitations (chromatic dispersion, PMD, nonlinearities) and of dispersion accommodation (MSSI) at 40 Gbit/s have been developed and used for the analysis of long-haul transmission, in laboratory experiments. This work provides a solid theoretical background for the reliable prediction of system performance and final system specification; The fibre link infrastructures for the system field tests have been defined and specified by the respective telecom operators.",0,0
920,57199,No,"Services, Technologies and Architectures enabLing InTErnet and PSTN integration","This Project is an answer to the problem of fast and efficient service provisioning in the converging IT/TLC environment, providing potential ground for new appealing services. The Project aims at defining and implementing a prototype of a unified Internet/PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) service environment, where compact and extendable service objects are created, deployed, managed and provisioned. The Project is based on a distributed Intelligent Network (IN) infrastructure, where services are deployed to active network nodes by exploiting Distributed Object and Mobile Agent Technology (DOT/MAT) platforms. Service designers will be given an integrated view of the underlying networks and will rapidly prototype and inject into the network new services by exploiting a distributed environment. Expected results, achieved by means of experiments, are the validation of the architecture and the verification of the adopted service handling criteria.  Objectives: The major objective of the Project is to define, implement and deploy a unified service framework, based on IN, Internet and using DOT/MAT, for creation, management, deployment and runtime provision of cross-network services, analysing MAT impacts on consolidated service creation procedures and achieving fast introduction of new services.  This includes: To develop the necessary major building blocks of the service framework, i.e. the following software components which support cross network services: an SCE (Service Creation Environment), an enhanced SMS (Service Management System), an enhanced ISN (Internet Service Node) including an upgraded MGC (Media Gateway Controller), and an enhanced ACS (Advanced Call Service); To develop services, including user mobility support, making use of the service chain provided by the project, and to achieve fast introduction of new services, exploiting the unified service framework.  Terms of comparison for this will be current IN SCE environments and related methodologies; To allow the provision of value-added cross-network services (e.g. Web-based profile handling, IN-based Internet services, media conversions), derived from PSTN and Internet integration; To provide solutions to user mobility issues within the unified framework; To demonstrate cross-network services, exploiting VoIP (Voice over IP) with solutions like IETF MEGACO, and also user mobility, achieving experimental validation of the architecture and adopted approach; To disseminate results obtained by the project in appropriate standardisation and research areas.  Work description: Fast provisioning of new services to end users has rapidly become the key issue in the modern telecommunications environment, often being the most important element determining the success of operators and manufacturers. The convergence of IT (Information Technology) and TLC (Telecommunications) determines a framework for potential new and appealing services, as Intelligent Network (IN) capabilities offered to Internet (IP) users, which must be provided efficiently in order to be competitive in a highly populated market. The Project will implement an integrated IT/TLC environment based on a distributed IN, exploiting Distributed Object and Mobile Agent Technologies (DOT/MAT), on top of which cross-network services are designed and deployed. These services are derived from the integration between distinct network capabilities (PSTN/Internet) and are uniformly controlled from creation to provisioning. DOT/MAT are used as a unified framework addressing the service chain (creation, deployment, management, provisioning), allowing the design and implementation of compact and extendable service objects, used in order to program active network nodes according to time-varying needs.  Prototypes of advanced distributed IN systems are enhanced and developed, leveraging on the results obtained within the ACTS framework and on partner internal activities: a Service Creation Environment (SCE), an extended Service Management System (SMS), an enhanced Internet Service Node (ISN) including an upgraded Media Gateway Controller (MGC), an enhanced Advanced Call Server (ACS). Extensive experiments are performed in order to validate the adopted approach, on the basis of services selected and implemented by the project by means of an innovative SCE and supported by the IT/TLC integrated framework. Project work will be complemented by disseminating the results in appropriate standardisation and research areas.

441,213884,No,SmartCharge: Smart integrated circuits for advanced battery management,"Electric vehicles (EV) are unquestionably the future of mobility, with numerous initiatives to accelerate its adoption. Nonetheless, technical gaps still exist on EV usage – several of them relating with battery capacity, cost, performance and safety concerns, which create several barriers for EV wider market uptake. Hereto, Battery Management Systems (BMS) have been playing a key role in optimizing the use of continuously larger battery stacks with improved endurance, performance and reliability, typically representing around 15% of the overall battery cost. Hereto, reducing their cost and improving their performance is key to minimize the battery-related bottlenecks for wide EV adoption.  LiBAL has developed a novel Integrated Circuit for Advanced Battery Management (ICAB). ICAB is an ASIC-based integrated circuit to be deployed as a local monitoring unit within large BMS. ICAB offers several disruptive features, including 1) an unmatched cost per monitored lithium cell (>50% lower than alternatives from major manufacturers), 2) enabling more efficient energy balancing across cells in the battery pack without ramping overall costs, through a unique, patent-protected hybrid balancing method and 3) is prepared to reduce the complexity of master/slave communication wiring through powerline communications.   To bridge the remaining steps towards full scale commercialization of ICAB, LiBAL has not only to widely demonstrate it in full scale but also to consolidate our strategic partnering throughout the EV value chain to ensure enough muscle for ICAB’s production ramp-up. The to-market maturation of ICAB within the present innovation project represents a strategic opportunity yielding a very large business potential for our company – opening a potential revenue stream summing up to over €325 mn over the 5-years post market introduction, from which LiBAL stands to capture over €63 mn as additional gross profits, while creating \50 new positions at our company.",0,0
771,103010,No,Exploring the Role of Semivolatile Gas-phase Vapors in Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation,"Semivolatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs) play a crucial role in Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) formation, a major uncertainty in climate models. SVOCs are products of gas-phase oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the troposphere, but they are very hard to measure in the gas phase. In the following proposed study, a new innovative method will be developed for the quantitative analysis of the burden of semivolatiles. The suitability of the denuders with different coatings will be identified for collecting SVOCs in the gas phase, and a modified Thermal-Desorption Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass -Spectrometer (TD-PTR-MS) will be developed for measuring SVOCs in the gas and the particle phases. In addition, the selectivity of the TD-PTR-MS method will be increased for better identification of organonitrates, organosulfates, and organic halogen compounds. The enhanced TD-PTR-MS instrument will elucidate the role of SVOCs in SOA formation, thereby yielding a better understanding of aerosol formation, aerosol-climate effects, and the human interference with the hydrologic cycle. The instrument will be deployed at Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) observatory to measure SVOCs from a rural area with urban and marine influences. This will give valuable insights into sources and the processing of SOAs, required for understanding the global SOA budget. These measurement data will be used to develop realistic parameterizations of the semivolatile burden of organics in the atmosphere under different meteorological conditions and pollution histories. The outcome of the project will be the development of a combined SVOC and organic aerosol measurement approach, the application of this new methodology in the field, and realistic parameterizations of SVOC budgets for use in climate models.",0,0

Blockchain Innovation Spaces (Block.IS) envisions to build an open and collaborative cross-border, cross-sectoral innovation ecosystem that fosters the use of this cutting-edge technology in three vital sectors for the European economy: agrifood, logistics and finance. Block.IS will bring together (connect) actors (with an emphasis on SMEs and clusters) from these three heavily interconnected sectors, with SMEs/ innovators, to catalyse their cooperation towards innovation-driven and mutual growth (boost).  The catalysation is aimed at networking the members of the ecosystem, raising understanding of the benefits of blockchain technology and stimulating the creation of new blockchain-based solutions - Cluster Missions and Clusters-Innovators Assembly.  Block.IS will support innovators (SMEs) all the way from ideation to commercialisation offering them tailored business and technical support as well as direct funding, through a novel funnel approach - Innovate > Experiment > Commercialise acceleration programme.  As such, the project will directly foster and strengthen competitiveness of digital SMEs (that will develop the solutions) and of the clusters and SMEs of the three verticals which will use them to offer added value to their customers.

Unfortunately, there is currently no solution available on the market that allows neither the comprehensive assessment of Social Vulnerabilities nor the management and reduction of the associated risk.   DOGANA aims to fill this gap by developing a framework that delivers 'aDvanced sOcial enGineering And vulNerability Assessment'. The underlying concept of DOGANA is that Social Vulnerabilities Assessments (SVAs), when regularly performed with the help of an efficient framework, help deploy effective mitigation strategies and lead to reducing the risk created by modern Social Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Two relevant features of the proposed framework are: i) the presence of the 'awareness' component within the framework as the cornerstone of the mitigation activities; ii) the legal compliance by design of the whole framework, that will be ensured by a partner and a  work package explicitly devoted to this task. Moreover, the outcomes of the project are also expected to provide a solid basis to revise the insurance models for cyber-attacks related risks, thanks to the involvement of 2 strong DOGANA partners in this area of activity.   The project will be implemented by a consortium of 18 partners, from 11 different countries, including users, technology providers of whom 3 are major world-wide cyber-security solutions market leaders as well as legal and psychological expertise. An extensive field trial plan enables the testing of the DOGANA platform with six users (4 partners and 2 supporting users) operating in the critical areas of energy, finance, transport, utilities, and public authorities.

838,217760,No,Low-power spin-wave-based computing,"Downscaling of Si-based microprocessors has considerably increased the amount of heating in computers and other information and communication technology (ICT) devices. As a result, computer servers in big data centres waste more than 90% of the electricity they pull off the grid. High-density electrical currents in microprocessors and interconnects cause excessive warm-up via an effect known as Joule heating. To fulfil future requirements for data transmission and processing rates with low energy consumption, a paradigm shift away from purely charge-based electronics is needed. Recently, post-Si computing with collective spin wave excitations in tailored magnets has been identified as a promising route. Spin waves are transmitted through a magnetic material without the displacement of electric charges (i.e. currents), thus drastically reducing energy consumption and heating. We recently demonstrated that short-wavelength spin waves can be emitted and manipulated by small voltage pulses in ferroelectric-ferromagnetic bilayers. In the ERC PoC project we will use our results to realise an industrially relevant integrated spin wave computing device.",0,0
828,21997,No,Analogue Libraries on Low-Cost CMOS Digital Process,"The main objective of the ALCD project is to allow system house designers to integrate mixed-mode analogue-digital applications in a low-cost mainstream digital CMOS technology, and this requires the development of new analogue design techniques necessary to meet the high-end specifications of an analogue library of cells.  By achieving the above-mentioned objectives, this project will contribute to the availability to European System Companies, including SMEs and SMT, of a competitive level compared to their US and Far Eastern competitors.   The results of this project will provide:   - access to a cheap technology  - a faster time to market  - the capability of designing mixed analogue-digital chips on advanced state-of-the-art digital process.   To be able to build the cells derived from the end-user application specifications, the Consortium will qualify new design techniques to allow high performance analogue design, preferably using the MOS transistor as the basic circuit element. The demonstration of the feasibility and cost efficiency of the developed techniques will be achieved through the integration of real end-users applications.   The Consortium will develop and qualify on silicon a library of high-end analogue functions. The library layouts will be released and distributed with their relevant documentation for exploitation by the partners. BOSCH and INTRACOM will use it to enlarge its design customer base in the ASIC cell-based market and thereby answer its customer requests.   The development of the library will be carried out in such a way that it meets the partners' applications needs target customers needs; offers the most attractive compromise between performances, functions and implementation flexibility (eg cell generators) in order to be attractive for a large range of customers; can later be portable from current 0.7 micron CMOS technology developed in the frame of ACCESS/JLP Project to 0.5 micron; is expandable to include further functions; is fully qualified on silicon; and is released with proper documentation on the most attractive partner's platform (eg CADENCE, MENTOR).   As soon as firm results become available from the research and development activities, the Consortium will use the Universities' information channels (eg conferences and journal publications) for dissemination. This will stimulate the acceptance by further designers and of course end-users of the technology and design techniques developed by the ALCD project. Throughout the development of the project, ES2 will also approach some of its most privileged customers to stimulate the adoption of the new design techniques and technology.

567,22525,No,DEVELOPMENT OF REACTION SINTERED MULLITE-ZIRCONIA FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS,"In the aluminium foundry, using a heating source directly immersed into a liquid metal provides numerous advantages compared to conventional gas or electrical furnaces using radiant heating, as far as cost saving and product quality are concerned. However, the development of immersion heaters comes up against difficulties: mainly thermal fatigue and corrosion as aluminium is one of the most aggressive metal melts due to its high affinity to oxygen and its ability to dissolve a great number of materials. During this project, the mechanism and kinetic of molten aluminium attack on MZ composites have been clarified and the great ability of the ceramic to resist aluminium corrosion demonstrated.   The long term use of the claddings is a major source of concern. The thermo-mechanical behaviour of the elaborated RSMZ material has been studied and it should provide the required durability. Small prototypes have been manufactured and successfully tested in conditions close to the solicitation on service: diving, maintaining and pulling out phases in molten aluminium. This proves the high potential of mullite-zirconia for immersed heater cladding for holding aluminium melts. However, the industrial slip casting of real-size claddings needs to be made more reliable.   The firing of porcelain etc. requires kiln furniture with good mechanical properties up to 1400 C. Silicon carbide ceramic proved the best element so far, despite an expensive cost. The elaboration of an over-stoechiometric mullite-zirconia with an higher alumina content has shown that this material has the required properties to be used as a kiln furniture, for a reduced cost. The good creep and oxidation resistance of the material at high temperature have been established. However, improvements on the industrial die pressing of the plates are needed to confirm the high potential of the ceramic towards this application. High temperature applications in industry require ceramic materials with high resistance to creep,thermal shock and corrosion.The outstanding properties of reaction sintered mullite-zirconia (RSMZ) ceramics developed in a previous EURAM project let us think these materials are suitable candidate for many high temperature applications.In order to show the large potentialities of the RSMZ ceramics,we have selected two different applications:kiln furniture used to hold pieces like porcelain or refractory tiles during the firing process and immersed heater cladding used to protect the heating element in molten aluminium.  The first step of the project will consist in elaborating the RSMZ ceramic. The elaboration process will be optimized according to the required final microstructure. Then,a maximum of two different compositions will be selected after preliminary corrosion, creep and mechanical tests. In a second step,the following studies will be carried out in the selected compositions:  1-corrosion mechanisms and kinetic studies;  2-thermal fatigue behaviour studied in connection with subcritical crack growth propagation;  3-creep resistance in oxydizing environment.  A finite element modelling will be done to determine the stress concentration locations during in-service loadings and to optimize the shape and size of the thermal heater.  Finally prototypes will be manufactured and tested in industrial service conditions.For immersed heater cladding,the aim is to attain six months without failure.Kiln furniture (plates,beams and rollers)made of RSMZ must have comparable performances as other available ceramics used for the same applications.After the tests,the in-service degradation will be characterized to ensure that long term extrapolations are reasonable.",0,0
815,191292,No,Dynamics of human genome architecture in stable and transient gene expression changes,"The classical view of genomes as linear sequences has been replaced by a vision of nuclear organization that is both dynamic and complex, with chromosomes and genes non-randomly positioned in the nucleus. Process compartmentalization and spatial location of genes modulate the transcriptional output of the genomes. However, how the interplay between genome structure and gene regulation is established and maintained is still unclear. The aim of this project is to explore whether the genome 3D structure acts as an information source for modulating transcription in response to external stimuli. With a genuine interdisciplinary team effort, we will study the conformation of the genome at various integrated levels, from the nucleosome fiber to the distribution of chromosomes territories in the nuclear space. We will generate high-resolution 3D models of the spatial organization of the genomes of distinct eukaryotic cell types in interphase to identify differences in the chromatin landscape. We will follow the time course of structural changes in response to cues that affect gene expression either permanently or transiently. We will analyze the changes in genome structure during the stable trans-differentiation of immortalized B cells to macrophages and during the transient hormonal responses of differentiated cells. We plan to establish novel functional strategies, based on targeted and high-throughput reporter assays, to assess the relevance of the spatial environment on gene regulation. Using sophisticated modeling and computational approaches, we will combine high-resolution data from chromosome interactions, super-resolution images and omics information. Our long-term plan is to implement a 3D browser for the comprehensive mapping of chromatin properties and genomic features, to better understand how external signals are integrated at the genomic, epigenetic and structural level to orchestrate changes in gene expression that are cell specific and dynamic.",0,0
63,16531,Yes,UTILIZATION OF VEGETABLE OILS AND THEIR DERIVATES AS DIESEL FUEL,"The objective of this demonstration programme was to gather reliable technical and economic information to enable the development of a European biodiesel industry. The activities included technical validation in pre industrial units of new processes in transesterification and experiments on different monitored fleets. The activities were linked to the concepts of generating added value on a national basis, as well as reducing energy dependency. In the case of biodiesel, these are not simple objectives due to the high cost of production and use of fossil fuel in farming and processing of rapeseed. Hence, analysis extended to the wider economic impacts, as well as considerations of the net energy balance.   This project shall demonstrate the technical and economical feasibility of producing diesel fuel from indigenous oil crops (Biodiesel) and its introduction into the energy market. The environmental effects of the entire production chain will be studied in detail. A European strategy for implementing this technology at large scale will be designed. The project is oriented according to six main axes:   a) Standardization: A set of physico-chemical standard parameters will be worked out mutually as the technical basis for a European standard proposal on:   - Rapeseed oil methylester (RME)  - RME blended at different ratios with fossil diesel fuel  - Natural rapeseed oil, as final quality for specially adopted engines.   b) Byproducts: Demo issues for glycerine in animal feed and synthetic chemistry.   c) Engine test: will be run with pure RME and different blends of RME and diesel fuel on test bench, dynamometer chassis and in large field test, covering modern engine types as well as special constructions and all major fields of application (transport in general, public and private).   d) European Strategy: Defining the systematic approach for large-scale production of biodiesel, including necessary political and industrial action:   - At CAP level as far as setaside land for energy is concerned/new market for agriculture.  - Decision on taxes, duties and incentives (C02, Sulphur, etc.) implementation of the agricultural and industrial production capacities.   e) Environment: Protecting the environment (against pollutants, exhaust gas, greenhouse effect) is of key importance in the development of the biofuel system. Therefore studies will be carried out to assess and minimize the impact on the environment caused by agricultural production, industrial processing and the use of such products.   f) Pre-industrial demonstration: elaboration of pre-industrial transesterification units in various environments and according to different processes. The comparison of final results will allow to define the optimal processes to be used for large-scale implementation. The impact of the production and use of rapeseed oil and other esters was assessed through the whole lifecycle of agricultural production and industrial processing, including impact of utilisation, handling and storage, as well as in terms of emissions (CO2, SO2, smoke intensity, etc).   The key question related to the feasibility of putting biodiesel production units into operation. This question was approached on the basis of results of micro economic studies at specified sites, a selection and comparison of various technologies, preparation of invitations to tender for pre industrial units and definition of support programmes, as well as a macro economic study of the biofuel industry drafting different possible scenarios in which different scales of infrastructure were applied. In general, the main deciding factors were political. The final reports from several Demonstration projects were presented to National Representatives and others at a symposium held in Paris in March 1996. Reports included that from the European Economic Interest Group (EEIG), known as EUROBIODIESEL, which, when set up, brought together French, German and Italian partners, who were joined in April 1992 by an Irish partner. It was clear that technical problems had been overcome; the main barriers to rapid expansion were economic or customer acceptance; and limits to production areas linked to agreements on animal feed. Where market conditions were favourable, expansion in production was occurring, with the fuel being used in its own right as a diesel substitute, as a blend with diesel or in heating boilers.   ADDITIONAL BENEFITS   The additional benefits which could be recognised included: reduced dependency on other (imported) protein rich feeds; continued agricultural production on set-aside land; positive impact on the environment (fossil carbon dioxide abatement); and some evidence for decreased pollution in terms of emission quality from engines running on biodiesel.   ACTIONS   In more detail, the actions undertaken covered specifications for vegetable oil based biofuels in terms of both pure rape oil for adapted engines, as well as for pure esters, on the basis of action already implemented and being financed by Germany. In addition, specifications were drawn up for mixtures of gas oil and methyl esters. Compatibility studies for different materials with esters, as well as toxicity and biodegradability studies, were also completed.   BY-PRODUCTS   Product price remains a key issue, which, apart from agricultural subsidies and/or tax concessions, is dependent on the marketing and handling of by-products. Studies relating to this crucial area included valorisation of glycerin in animal feeds (dealt with in France) and studies of new industrial applications for glycerin depending on its purity.   ENGINE TESTS   Engine tests were carried out, both on optimised motors and in the form of long term tests on different types of standard vehicles, including low temperature tests (to 20 degrees C), tests on target captive fleets (public transport, maritime and river transport), emission tests with catalytic converters and investigation of public acceptance.",0,1

Also, increased requirements for certification from legislation, together with the perceived trend towards 'product-oriented' standards (from 'process-oriented' ones), demand fundamental paradigm shifts in the certification perspectives. pSafeCer is targeting increased efficiency and reduced time-to-market by composable safety certification of safety-relevant embedded systems. The industrial domains targeted are within automotive and construction equipment, avionics, and rail. pSafeCer will also develop certification guidelines and a training example for other domains, thus considerably increasing its market impact. A primary objective is to provide support for system safety arguments based on arguments and properties of system components as well as to provide support for generation of corresponding evidence in a similar compositional way. By providing support for efficient reuse of certification and stronger links between certification and development, component reuse will be facilitated, and by providing support for reuse across domains the amount of components available for reuse will increase dramatically. The resulting efficiency and reduced time to market will, together with increased quality and reduced risk, increase competitiveness and pave the way for a cross-domain market for software components qualified for certification. pSafeCer brings together leading companies and SMEs across Europe (including OEMs, technology, tool, and competence providers, as well as certification and standardisation experts), which together with selected universities and research institutes are capable and motivated to realize the pSafeCer objectives.",1,0
132,105195,Yes,Parallel Distributed Infrastructure for Minimization of Energy,"The increasing power and energy consumption of modern computing devices is perhaps the largest threat to technology minimization and associated gains in performance and productivity. On the one hand, we expect technology scaling to face the problem of 'dark silicon' (only segments of a chip can function concurrently due to power restrictions) in the near future and lead us to use devices with completely new characteristics. On the other hand, as core counts increase, the shared memory model based on cache coherence will severely limit scalability and increase energy consumption. Therefore, to overcome these problems, we need new computing paradigms that are radically more energy efficient.The objective of ParaDIME is to attack the power-wall problem by radical software-hardware techniques that are driven by future circuit and device characteristics on one side, and by a programming model based on message passing on the other side. In particular ParaDIME willutilize: circuit and architecture operation below safe voltage limits for drastic energy savings, the use of specialized energy-aware computing accelerators, energy-aware runtime, approximate computing and power-aware message passing. The outcome of the project will be a processor architecture for a heterogeneous distributed system that utilizes future device characteristics for dramatic energy savings.Wherever possible, ParaDIME will adopt multidisciplinary techniques, such as hardware support for message passing, runtime energy optimization utilizing new hardware energy performance counters, use of accelerators for error recovery from sub-safe voltage operation, and approximate computing through annotated code.Furthermore, we will establish and investigate the theoretical limits of energy savings at the device, circuit, architecture, runtime, and programming model levels of the computing stack, as well as quantify the actual energy savings achieved by the ParaDIME approach for the complete computing stack.",0,1

As such an increasing number of users are venturing online via their mobile phones in search of interesting content. In fact, mobile devices are already becoming the primary mode of Internet access for a large fraction of the world’s population. However, the Mobile Internet represents a challenging information access environment due to the inherent limitations of the mobile space, limitations that go beyond simple screen size or network issues. Mobile users have information needs that are impacted by contexts such as location, time and activity. Furthermore, human beings are social creatures that often seek out new strategies for sharing knowledge and information in mobile settings. Mobile information access presents its own challenges and opportunities that go beyond those of traditional desktop-based information access. The goal of this proposal is twofold: (1) to understand mobile users and their information needs, (2) to investigate future mobile information access services. A key component in the design of effective mobile services is to understand mobile users and their needs. As mobile technology advances, we can come to expect new behaviours to emerge. This is especially true as diverse user groups adopt mobile technology and as experienced mobile users adapt to new paradigms in mobile interaction.

On the other hand, the networks that arise in social life are not arbitrary, but exhibit certain structural characteristics which are mainly the result of their intrinsic randomness. Our primary aim is to analyse rigorously mechanisms that describe the word of mouth dissemination of information on a typical instance of a random network whose distributional characteristics are similar to those observed in real social networks. Furthermore, we intend to develop strategies that aim at the maximisation of the spread of a new belief on a typical instance of such a random network. More specifically, we will attempt to identify those structures that typically arise in a random network and facilitate the efficient spread of a new idea in it. This will lead to the design of efficient algorithms that will be working well in practice, that is, for the majority of the instances of a social network.",0,0
816,224653,No,"ATomic LAyer NanoprinTer, for rapid micro- and nanoprototyping of complex multi-material 2D/3D structures with high-resolution","The 3D printing of micro- & nanostructures has been showing a huge potential over conventional methods (thin film microfabrication) for micromachining Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and sensors with small and complex features, in an up to 9x faster and 95% cheaper way. Still, current 3D printing solutions are severely limited by their printing resolution (>300 nm), restricted to a few printable materials and lacking design flexibility.  ATLANT created the first 3D printer for rapid multi-material prototyping on the micro- and nanoscale that replaces multiple one-function devices by an all-in-one machine: ATLANT3D, a unique solution combining 3 proven technologies, namely atomic layer deposition, microfluidics, and 3D printing. ATLANT3D will accelerate prototyping for micro-/nanodevices and systems at a fraction of the current cost, drastically reducing the required time, risks and production waste, as well as enabling customization when testing new ideas and products at nanoscale. Despite having the potential to fabricate any micro-/nanodevice, ATLANT’s initial focus is on the fast-growing market of MEMS & sensors, projected to reach 23B€ by 2023. Several leading microfabrication companies in the field already expressed a strong interest in testing our technology for their product development.  To bridge the remaining steps towards full-scale commercialization of the technology, ATLANT has to widely demonstrate its technological benefits and economic assets over competing solutions, aimed to ensure public acceptance and enough muscle for ATLANT3D production ramp-up. Thus, ATLANT will leverage from the current SME instrument application as a vital stepping stone to prepare the company’s business strategy and to pave the way to a solid position on the emergent 3D printing industry for micro-/nanodevices fabrication. In the long term, the vision for ATLANT3D is to become the one device needed for prototyping in any micro-/nanofabrication environment.",0,0

853,209421,No,Collective Adaptive Systems Enabler Kit,"In 2008 Apple introduced the App Store. It was a watershed moment in the history of digitalization and it made a huge impact on human society. With the App Store, Apple created a sustainable model to leverage the potential of mobile computing by tapping into the creativity of developers at large.    We're currently on the cusp of a new chapter in the history of digitalization: the Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet of Things has been heralded as the Fourth Industrial Revolution and promises creative solutions to pressing business and societal problems. The Cassting project, from which CASEK arises, made important theoretical and methodological contributions to the Internet of Things.    But developments in the IoT have fallen short of expectations, and due to the complicated and fragmented context of the IoT, nobody has been able to do the same for the IoT that the App Store did for mobile computing – until now.   The CASEK project sets the stage to dramatically accelerate developments in IoT through its sustainable marketplace model. CASEK will leverage the potential of the Internet of Things by tapping into the creativity of developers at large, powered by the Cassting framework.     During the CASEK project, we will focus on two aspects to support our ambition: business and technology. The business focus has as its objective to solidify a business and marketing plan. The technology focus has as its objective to develop a viable product offering.  To best reach these objectives, the CASEK project seeks to galvanize and learn from a community consisting of researchers on the one hand and emerging entrepreneurs on the other, as we see these groups as the vanguard to mainstream commercial adoption, which is our ultimate goal.   Both the business and technical focus will be executed cyclically in iterative cycles where emerging results from each focus can be taken as input for forthcoming cycles.",0,0
374,79422,No,Networked Embedded System middleware for heterogeneous physical devices in a distributed architecture,"Producers of devices and components are increasingly facing the need for networking their own and complementary products in order to provide higher value-added solutions for their customers or because citizen centred demands require much more focus on intelligent solutions where the complexity is hidden behind user-friendly interfaces to promote Inclusion.  Given the enormous amount of heterogeneous devices, sensors and actuators with embedded systems already existing in the market, the diversity of the producers and manufactures, the different clock speed of the deployed technologies (from several decades to some months), there is a very large need for technologies and tools that easily can add, implement and exploit the intelligence embedded in the devices. The goal for the producers is to be able to build cost-efficient ambient intelligence systems with optimal performance, high confidence, reduced time to market and faster deployment and still build on the enormous assets of the installed base.  Due to fast changing user environments of mobile users, ambient services and applications adapt to changing local and environmental sets of accessible sensors and actuators, and must piece together partial states of internal and situational available knowledge. When the user moves around interacting with any private device and public surrounding computers, it's the right information that must follow her migrating from different hosts in changing environments.  The main objective of the project is to develop a platform for ambient computing supporting the self-adaptive interplay of different components, not only sensors but also modelling components, controlling components implementing the application logic, and actuators.

689,103359,No,Graphene-Ferroelectric Interface for Electronic and Spintronic Technologies,"Graphene is a perfect infinite single layer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms densely packed into a benzene-ring structure. The confinement of electrons in two dimensions and the peculiar symmetry of the carbon network give graphene exceptional electronic properties that make it a promising material for carbon-based nanoelectronics and spintronics. In particular, the performances of such devices rely on the exceptional intrinsic carrier mobility of graphene. However, extrinsic scattering sources due to standard SiO2 substrates limit the mobility. Hence, the quest for alternative substrates is mandatory in order to increase the mobility beyond the extrinsic limits. Among the possible candidates, ferroelectric (FE) substrates are the most promising due to their ultrahigh dielectric constant and hysteretic dielectric response to an electric field (Objective 1). In addition, periodic polarization domains can be written in FE materials, resulting in a substrate with tunable periodic potential that would allow the engineering of the electronic properties of graphene without etching (Objective 2). Further, a magnetic FE (magnetoelectric, ME) substrate can induce magnetism in graphene and can transfer the ME properties to the graphene itself, hence allowing for electrical control of magnetism in graphene (Objective 3). The three Objectives of the present Proposal concern the theoretical investigation of these new hybrid graphene-FE and graphene-ME systems. Unveiling the properties of graphene-FE and graphene-ME interfaces is a fundamentally important first step towards the development of novel nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. In order to achieve the accuracy needed to capture the fine physical details and due to the nanoscopic scale of the systems to be studied, quantum-mechanical computations with atomic resolution are necessary. Hence, first-principles techniques based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) are the method chosen to address the proposed objectives.",0,0

The major benefits are a reduced time-to-market of the new products, besides a high quality level of the final results. This is an opportunity for the creation of virtual markets for digital object treatment, where every enterprise can search the processing services it is interested in, but also new companies can gain a market share by providing new services for the categories of interesting digital objects. The variety of the required services and the number of possible digital objects asking for them lead to the conclusion that, on the base of the Web technologies, a faster growing number of enterprises interested to the same digital object types will become providers or customers of the processing services.  The proposed pilot action is targeted to formalise and test a methodology to: 1. Define new markets for 'digital object handling' and related market opportunities; 2. Facilitate the setting-up of new companies based on peculiar know-how, skill and the necessary capability of providing high quality performance in certain categories of digital object processing; 3. Make a preliminary test of the ITC tools to create and enhance a virtual market based on an Internet portal.  Such a methodology will be the core of a virtual incubator of enterprises implementing the market of digital objects processing through: - the guideline books for the support of the potential user enterprises to access this new market; - the set up of a network as reference point with a view to create successful schemes 'show cases'; - to support measures to all enterprises that apply innovative methodologies with a view for implementing the process of their internal production; - a virtual intranet portal, connected to the Internet, to standardise data exchange and connect service providers with customers; - to share and promote information on benefits of processing digital objects through the above-mentioned items.  Specific results expected at the end of the project lifetime: The results of the project will be: - The virtual incubator methodology itself; - The show-case produced by running the simulated examples; - The experience gained by setting up and running at least two different Internet portals to standardise object communication format. The attention will be focused on ITC standards, relevant with respect to the test cases.  The program results will not only act as an incubator rule for company-to-born but also as a seed for new markets: up to now, services related to digital object handling are not at all a real market since customers and providers have to search each other mainly on a geographical local basis. Hence, the presence of Internet portals will act as meeting points, a sort of virtual marketplaces, were business opportunities can grow easily.",0,0

At present, GDF is in relation with two manufacturers to ensure industrial development. They have to work together in order to validate an industrial polishing technique in evaluating its industrial feasibility. Indeed, all the processes (surface preparation, thermal spraying) ensure now a good reproductibility of the coating quality except for the final step : polishing.   Moreover, the polished finish cannot be used on complex shape. Then another technique named microballing is currently studied.   - Pistons of CR-FIAT (thermal barrier application - HEXA 13 coating).   After several difficulties linked to a complex shape and the nature of the substrate, all processes were mastered : surface preparation and thermal spraying on top of pistons, machining operation in order to eliminate the coating surplus on the lateral sides.   An engine bench was performed on three pistons with complete success.   - Blades for aircraft engine (INTA, ONERA) (thermal berrier application - HEXA 13 coating)   A complete engine bench was performed including 15 blades with HEXA 13 coating.   The engine worked for 12 hours at maximum power without any problem.   The results (micrographies to analyse the structure of the coating) will be discussed in September 97 and attached to the final report.   - Naturally, the availability of the ICO25B3 and HEXA 13 powders is to be ranked as a successful result as well as that of the QC \ Zr O(2) mixed cords which may be used in low cost thermal insulation. A complete data base on alloy compositions and thermal properties versus temperature is available. New metallic materials, patented and produced on an industrial basis by partners of the consortium for the propose of one specific application, may be used as well for preparing Thermal Barrier Coatings and Low Friction Coatings. Their thermal conductivity is of the magnitude of that of zirconia and they offer friction coefficients with respect to steel in the range 0.08 - 0.15.

The project's core idea is that the design of a flexible network architecture and the implementation of low-complexity, energy-efficient mmWave hardware are interconnected physical-layer research problems. The proposed project thus represents the first attempt towards the joint network- and device-level design and optimization of beyond-5G wireless systems. Its ultimate goal is to provide a unified view of the types of network and hardware that are necessary to deliver tailored services for current and emerging wireless applications under a common and sustainable physical infrastructure. More specifically, it has the following main objectives: i) develop new theoretical knowledge on application-specific device coordination and novel distributed resource allocation schemes to support the coexistence of network- and device-centric mechanisms; ii) provide new analytical insights into the performance-complexity tradeoff in beam-space processing and low-resolution ADCs/DACs for mmWave communications; iii) analyze the interplay between network- and device-level design parameters for a given service/application. Relevant emerging wireless frameworks, such as cell-free massive MIMO and D2D-aided multicasting, will be considered. The proposed research involves advanced mathematical skills and interconnects expertise from communication/information theory, signal processing, and (distributed) optimization theory.

The introduction of this technology will open up an entirely-new window of molecular imaging possibilities, thereby supporting advances in biology, drug discovery & development and diagnostics.  Funded by ERC, Prof. Brunsveld and colleagues have developed modular nanoparticles that exactly address the needs of the molecular imaging field. These nanoparticles of organic nature can be produced in a reproducible one-step method by self-assembly in water. The result is a highly-robust and biocompatible nanoparticle that can be modulated to emit any desirable colour frequency with long-term emission and high photostability. Moreover, they can be functionalised with multiple ligands thanks to great control over surface functionality and can be prepared not only for fluorescent studies, but also for other imaging technologies. In practise this implies that the technology platform can be used to advance a wide range of in-vitro and in-vivo assays and to visualise yet-uncovered processes.  It is the objective of BioNLight to select the most interesting applications for commercialisation and to build up a prospectus that can be used to convince future customers of the practicability and the imaging power of our technology platform. Besides, we aim to construct a sound business model and strategy for commercialisation. This will be done by external validation of the nanoparticles by industry followed by final optimisation, by means of an extensive market study, by building a strong IP position and by setting up a business plan with detailed financial feasibility projections.

This future computing continuum, composed of a wide set of heterogeneous platforms, promises to be a fertile environment to engineer advanced services with high added value. In practice however, the extreme heterogeneity of platforms and networks is a major lock for software and service developers who are not able to exploit to their full potential the diversity of platforms capabilities.<br/>Current software engineering approaches indeed tend to provide dedicated support for managing and exploiting only parts of the continuum. For example, current cloud computing and service-oriented software engineering practices provide efficient abstractions for virtualizing the infrastructure in order for the software engineers to concentrate on the business logic of the applications. However these techniques merely support integration of mobile devices, sensors and actuators 'as-a-service' and lack specific support for advanced exploitation of these small devices.<br/>Furthermore, although sensor network nodes, gateways, smart-phones, and most smart-objects tend to be provided with clear documentation and proper interfaces, different vendors rely on different standards and conventions to use and customize their devices. Thus, most pervasive systems tend to be proprietary silos not easily exploitable by others.<br/>The HEADS project leverages Model-Driven Software Engineering and generative programming techniques to provide a new integrated software engineering approach which enables the advanced exploitation of the full range of diversity and specificity of the future computing continuum.<br/>The main result of the HEADS project is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supporting the collaboration between platform experts (having a deep knowledge of a reduced set of platforms) and service developers (needing to deal with a large set of platforms to develop added-value services). This IDE will include a Domain Specific Modeling Language and a methodology for the specification, validation, deployment and evolution of software-intensive services distributed across the future computing continuum.<br/>The HEADS IDE will benefit to services developers by allowing them to easily exploit a set of heterogeneous platform (mobile devices, sensors, smart objects, etc.) in the design of their cloud based services.

551,46869,No,Visual recognition and mechanical handling of flexible materials,"The focus of this project is on automated production and manufacturing processes that require on-line assessment and sorting. European SMEs working in the field of manufacturing are often characterized by a low technological level. Moreover, repetitive and unskilled tasks are still demanding to operators. A clear disadvantage with respect to non-European industries, who have much lower production costs (e.g.,man power), must be pointed out. This proposal concerns the study and development of innovative techniques for automating and optimizing industrial processes. The system comprises two main components which will communicate directly to achieve automated sorting of disordered work-pieces such as fur skins, fabric or other flexible components. First a machine vision system comprising a computer controlled lighting and digital camera and associated image processing boards and software will be used to recognize specific work-piece objects. The location and orientation of individual work- pieces will be determined. The second system component, a manipulator arm will be to pick up the work-piece, re-orient it and place it down in a prescribed ordered fashion ready for transport to the next manufacturing or finishing process. The computer controlled robot arm, which can be a standard light-weight industrial robot, will be fitted with special purpose gripper systems which will enable reliable handling of these delicate flexible materials without damage. Machine vision systems are actually more economic thanks to advanced in sensor, lighting techniques and computing power. In particular, specific project objectives are: a) to increase the competitiveness of European SMEs and reach a satisfactory market situation; b) to increase the safety of the working environment according to EEC directives; c) to prove the feasibility of a new high-performance processing systems in this application. The main innovative aspect of this project lies in the integration of new artificial vision techniques (e.g., statistical morphology for feature extraction, artificial neural networks for surface recognition, etc.) for a specific visual inspection task whose goal is to extract reliable 2D and 3D information aimed at recognizing either fur skins or textile items according to sizes and shape. In particular: 1) the optimization and the regulation of the functioning of each visual sensor by regulating its own characteristic parameters aimed at improving the interpretation/recognition processes. 2) control and robotic techniques will be used for the automation and tele-operation of unskilled or repetitive tasks. 3) new artificial vision techniques will be developed to improve the visual inspection task. 4) a man-machine interface will be studied for on-line displaying to the operators each particular of the automated process.

64,51849,Yes,Rad and restructuring in the CC and Russian,"Foreseen Results  Countries, which are rather similar in their overall levels of technological and scientific development will intensify the intra-industry relations, but not necessarily their pattern of inter-industry specialization. The policies of scientific and technological cooperation with CC and NIS will be to a large extent determined by those factors. Future employment, qualification of labour, economic structure in donors and recipient countries of direct investment and assistance depend on cooperation an the advanced fields of sciences and/or in organization, marketing, financial spheres where CC and NIS have weak experience. This research proposal brings together the research groups of different disciplines and different countries: Austria, France, Poland, Russian and United kingdom. The research proposal presents joint projects within the INCO - COPERNICUS programma in economic and social sciences. It focuses on the complex interaction between transition, technology diffusion , institutional transformation and employment within an increasingly open environment in CC and Russia.  Three main research directions are proposed :  1. National system of research and innovation, and its transformation during the transition to an open market economy and to knowledge based society of countries and regions with combined effects of social and technological change. The national differences reflect previous economic histories, legal forms and various abilities for creating the mechanisms of virtual technical and human development. The level and direction of investment, the utilization of a skilled labour force, the possibility to adapt regulation mechanisms (legal and fiscal) determine the pattern of the transformation process. It is important to compare the relative advantage of the institutional frameworks in EU countries and new ones in CC and Russia.  2. This second direction of research focuses more specifically on the RDT employment synergy between research centers and new technology based firms in the process of scientific discoveries and applications. The sectoral shift away from manufacturing in CC towards services is accompanied by an expansion of small and medium firms, and often by diffusion of high technology equipment. New firms need skilled labour and recruit researchers and engineers, creating the conditions of part time employment in both enterprise and academic centers. Such changes may be favourable for new ways of knowledge production. The new formulations of science and technology long- term policies has to be seen from such ventures, even if the actual situation and major problems of science development may arise from financial constraints.  3. Finally, there is the question of competition and of integration into Europe. Economic theory suggests that technological and industrial specialization increases as countries which have attained different levels of economic development liberalize their economic and scientific relationships which each other.",1,1

Utilities are forced to invest hundreds of millions in order to prevent catastrophic consequences. GridON is offering Fault Current Limiters (FCL) for transmission, distribution and industrial grids, which enable capacity growth, while improving energy efficiency and network stability. By suppressing excessive faults, FCLs enable grid meshing and cost-effective connection of additional power generation and renewable low-carbon energy sources. FCLs eliminate network upgrades and early retirement of fit-for use equipment, reducing capex by 10s-100s of millions of euros. FCLs reduce the overall impedance across a meshed grid, hence reducing losses and offsetting millions of tonnes of carbon emissions. GridON has successfully installed FCLs in live grids. Our FCL at UK Power Networks has proven extremely effective in clamping many faults during the past 18 months. It has proven extremely robust, reliable and easy to operate and maintain. Another commercial unit is now being installed in Western Power Distribution’s primary substation in UK. GridON’s FCL has received very strong recognition from its customers, who plan to install additional FCLs. Following discussions with prospective customers in EU and ROW, GridON has been realizing a multi-billion euros potential for FCLs. That said, we’ve realized that a smaller device would dramatically impact FCL adoption. GridON has gained extensive experience in designing and manufacturing FCL technology, and we trust our ability to reduce the size and cost of our existing technology by 25-50%. GridON has reached preliminary proof of concept stage (TRL4) for the required improvements. GridON is seeking funding under the SME Instrument program to design, build and test a demonstration unit that will be ready for commercial scaling.",1,1

The work is based on the philosophy of the Pegasus project:  - generic multimedia platforms, rather than single multimedia applications are the key elements of the 'multimedia market' of the future, - communication and processing should be integrated, - resource management to provide application QoS guarantees is required.  Pegasus II will employ the operating system kernel (Nemesis) and storage system built in the course of the original Pegasus project as a basis for future work, and will extend it to cover the outstanding issues which we have learnt are essential for industry acceptance of the Pegasus architecture: support of current applications and programming environments, and effective user control over the resource allocation policy via an obvious user interface.   The results of Pegasus will be used as the underlying operating system. Furthermore, an existing UK funded collaboration (project DCAN) between APM and Cambridge has already ported the ANSA-RT system to Nemesis to enable it to be used as a platform for distributed control of telecommunications networks.  Pegasus II will have as its first concern the higher level functionality: emulation of standard environments to enable porting of application software; tool kits for scheduling, synchronisation and manipulation of continuous media; and user interfaces which allow user control of resource management. However, more fundamental work in the development of the kernel and of networking technologies will also have a place in the work.  In short, the project will migrate from a successful research prototype to a system available to industry for evaluation and experimentation which provides many of the familiar features required to make its adoption possible. Multimedia applications of the future will involve the distributed processing of multimedia information in systems ranging from large servers, through workstations all the way down to 'set top boxes'. The implementation of such applications will be greatly eased by the use of a common architecture providing application level quality of service, and, where possible, a common software platform even where the underlying hardware has diverse capabilities.",0,0

Nowadays, the most important trade loads are being transported between the two continents by sea. Railway transport, using the existing and new land routes for the Trans-Eurasian land bridge presents a viable alternative to the maritime routes, which is gaining significant momentum. Due to the origins and current nature of this rail land bridge, numerous issues need to be resolved to bring the system to a modern state of infrastructure, services and operations.

115,224179,Yes,Digital Platform for Construction in Europe,"In modern economy, digitalization is a major driver of productivity growth across industries and services. However, the construction sector is lagging behind, even behind agriculture. The construction sector is characterised by a high presence of SMEs, low capitalization, a low rate of higher educated employees, low investment in innovation, and a long supply chain. Moreover, in the EU market, different languages, taxation, and regulatory frameworks are obstacles to Union synergies. DigiPLACE will exploit EU added value. Several initiatives have been developed at national level to improve the innovation in this sector. At EU level, some projects were devoted to facilitating the exchange of information, practice and knowledge (e.g. CPR 305/2011 and Levels). DigiPLACE will create a common ecosystem of innovation, standardization and commerce with the aim to collect the achieved results and to increase the productivity of the sector and the quality of its end products (building&infrastructure). Could digitalization help the sector to solve these historical issues and future ones? What kind of digitalization, what kind of market, what kind of production and supply-chain we could imagine? What kind of consumers do we have for our products and services. How do these worlds work together? DigiPLACE aims to investigate all these themes with a strong analysis of markets, actors and barriers. It will define a Reference Architecture Framework (RAF) for digital construction platform based on an EU-wide consensus involving a large community of stakeholders and the expertise of selected key players, resulting in a strategic roadmap for successful implementation of this RAF. DigiPLACE will rely on a large set of partners, linked 3rd parties and an Advisory Board representing leading European entities, companies and/or associations of industry, builders, owners (private and public), architects, research institutes, and ICT firms (for digital production, services and knowledge).",1,1
789,213313,No,Advanced Universal Control and monitoring solution to remotely manage complex power systems,"To successfully transition to renewable energy and reach its goals of phasing out of fossil fuels by 2050 to cut CO2 emissions by 95%, millions of Hybrid Power Systems (HPS) will need to be deployed in the EU to assure a reliable and secure electricity supply. However, HPS are complex systems (made up of dozens of different components by a variety of manufacturers) that require a control and management solution to assure this high performance and reliability. Without such a solution, it would be impossible for the EU to transition to large scale renewable energy deployments and guarantee a stable and decentralized electricity grid.  At Infinite Fingers GmbH, we identified the potential of this unexploited market niche, and came up with a unique solution, U-Control: an innovative control and management solution for Hybrid Power Systems (HPS) which is able to integrate all components. With U-Control, we will create a fully customizable control system that consists of a cloud software and hardware controller. We’ve already verified the interest for our solution in the market (with 70 units of our first prototype deployed in the market by or commercial partners). Thus, we are now determined to finalize the development of our solution, so as to put into the market the most versatile control and management solution for HPS worldwide, and take advantage of the €324 million opportunity of the global HPS market. Our goal is to become a leading technology company for the EUs renewable energy revolution, for which we count with a multinational team (from Germany, England, Hungary, South-Africa and Spain) with combined exceptional experience in LIB technology, renewable energy and energy efficiency and a strong business background, and an extensive network of international partners, such as Firefly Clean Energy (UK) or AutarcTech (Germany).",1,0
956,109447,No,Algorithms and Complexity of Highly Decentralized Computations,"'Many of today's and tomorrow's computer systems are built on top of large-scale networks such as, e.g., the Internet, the world wide web, wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, or peer-to-peer networks. Driven by technological advances, new kinds of networks and applications have become possible and we can safely assume that this trend is going to continue. Often modern systems are envisioned to consist of a potentially large number of individual components that are organized in a completely decentralized way. There is no central authority that controls the topology of the network, how nodes join or leave the system, or in which way nodes communicate with each other. Also, many future distributed applications will be built using wireless devices that communicate via radio.  The general objective of the proposed project is to improve our understanding of the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of decentralized distributed systems.  From an algorithmic point of view, decentralized networks and computations pose a number of fascinating and unique challenges that are not present in sequential or more standard distributed systems. As communication is limited and mostly between nearby nodes, each node of a large network can only maintain a very restricted view of the global state of the system. This is particularly true if the network can change dynamically, either by nodes joining or leaving the system or if the topology changes over time, e.g., because of the mobility of the devices in case of a wireless network. Nevertheless, the nodes of a network need to coordinate in order to achieve some global goal.  In particular, we plan to study algorithms and lower bounds for basic computation and information dissemination tasks in such systems. In addition, we are particularly interested in the complexity of distributed computations in dynamic and wireless networks.'",0,0
593,109575,No,An Advanced Structural Integrity System for Air Transport Composites using NDT Evaluation and Damage Tolerance Methods,"There is a huge industrial and innovative need for more efficient and reliable damage inspection as well as for reducing the time and cost for aircraft infrastructure maintenance and especially C and D Checks without compromising the safety of passengers and goods transported. This reduction would increase the value for money for the European aerospace industries. Moreover, airline companies will be able to reduce their tickets’ prices and make air travel more affordable to European citizens. Last but not least, this reduction can potentially release new investments and funds to explore aircraft innovative designs and technologies. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for improving structural maintenance efficiency that will ensure not only the safe air transport of European citizens, goods and military operations but will also promote the sustainable growth of the fastest mean of transport in a tough economic era. The TRACE-IT project is focused upon the development of an innovative inspection system, with automated and manual capabilities, for any type of composite aircraft structures. The structural integrity system is comprised by two parts: a qualified PA method attached to a mobile manipulating system, and a DT (Damage Tolerance) assessment technique processed on a computer. The results from the PA technique will be used as inputs to perform a DT numerical analysis for the inspected component. Eventually, the results from the PA technique as well as the results from the DT analysis will be available, to the inspector, in a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI). Consequently, an average skilled inspector will be able to take more appropriate and cost efficient maintenance actions (e.g. component repair or complete substitution) than today’s inspection procedures.",0,0

230,78626,Yes,Electricity Research Road Map In Europe,"The various operators of the electricity sector are living very strong changes mostly due to the elimination of monopolia and to the introduction of competition in the electric market. Price volatility and uncertainties in availability of fossil fuels as well as the more and more important environmental constraints are additional factors that call for the innovation of the electric industry. On the other side the operators (mostly utilities and manufacturers) are focusing their research efforts on short-term objectives, aimed to increase their competitiveness; investments on long term objectives able to significantly innovate the electric sector are very limited.  The proposed ERMInE Project intends to help EU authorities in achieving the objectives that follow: - to get an exhaustive picture of present situation of electricity Research and Technology Development (RTD) efforts in the enlarged Europe; - to state the specific RTD needs of the European utilities and equipment manufacturers in the next 20-25 years.  The main activities developed in the project in order to fulfil the aforesaid objectives are: - Wide and extensive collection of data and information: to get a clear understanding of the present status of RTD within the electricity sector, to identify the expected trend and the main objectives and expectations of electric utilities and manufacturers in the undertaken or planned research activities.

872,44112,No,Hydrogen-rich gas from biomass steam gasification,"This project is directed at the development of a fluidised bed gasification process for the production of a hydrogen rich gas from biomass. It is proposed to design and build a pilot scale unit that could integrate with a commercially available fuel cell power plant that is at present being modified for operation with hydrogen feed. In order to achieve the necessary high hydrogen yield, steam has been chosen as the gasification agent and suitable catalytic agents will be included in the bed inventory. The fluidisation system will consist of both a gasification and a combustion zone. The heat necessary for the gasification process will be generated by the combustion process and transferred by circulating the bed material through the two zones. A laboratory scale test rig (100 kWth) incorporating the above circulatory, heat transfer principle, using sand as bed material, has been operated successfully yielding encouraging results in straightforward gasification applications. The objective of the proposed project is the maximisation of the hydrogen content of the product gas in a scaled up, pilot-plant unit capable of fully demonstrating the feasibility of an economically viable industrial plant.   To demonstrate one potentially powerful application of the product gas, it is proposed to use it for electrical energy production in a fuel cell. Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) have been chosen as these represent an industrial reality, with well defined operating characteristics, readily available for field operation. An additional attraction of this application is that sufficient steam is generated as a by-product of the fuel cell operation to provide all the requirements for the steam fluidised gasifier.  Achieving the above objective involves the construction and operation of a pilot-scale test unit consisting of a 500 kWth biomass steam gasifier, a PAFC module and the necessary gas cleaning and CO steam reforming facilities.  In order to minimise the tar content and maximise the hydrogen yield (the PAFC fuel) in the product gas, the fluidised bed inventory will be chosen so as to be catalytically active for both the cracking and reforming of high molecular weight gasification products, and for methane conversion into hydrogen. Natural mineral substances (dolomite, olivine, alumina), as well as commercial and tailored Ni catalysts with perovskite structures, will be utilised. A further advantage of the dual fluidised bed configuration of the gasifier is that it enables carbon deactivation of the catalyst particles to be dealt with (by regeneration in the combustion zone) without provision in the plant layout of secondary, high temperature, catalytic reactors. The design will also seek to minimise particle-particle and particle-wall frictional effects in the solids circulation system so as to reduce catalyst losses related to the production of fines by attrition.",0,0

The research conducted by MIND includes new network topologies like ad-hoc, self-organising networks, improved QoS support in IP mobile networks, enhancements of HIPERLAN/2 and investigations of spectrum requirements for systems beyond 3G. In this context, HIPERLAN/2 is seen as part of a 4G system, which complements traditional cellular systems such as UMTS. The resulting concepts of the MIND access network will be validated by running trials based on UMTS, HIPERLAN/2, and IPv6 testbeds. Results will be contributed to relevant standards bodies.  Objectives: 1. Overall aim: To facilitate the rapid creation of broadband multimedia services and applications that are fully supported and customised when accessed by future mobile users from a wide range of wireless access technologies. 2. Research areas: To extend the concepts of IP mobile networks.

Services and Applications - This area aims to define and improve mechanisms for the seamless provision of IP services and applications, to develop new business and service models. 2. Network support - To support mobile Internet applications, MIND will specify an advanced IP network layer that will meet the following objectives: support for ad-hoc and self provisioned networks attached to a fixed IP network; investigation of features offered by IPv6; support of multi-homed terminals and vertical handover over multiple air interfaces; development of protocols to support fixed-mobile convergence; investigation of the inter-related issues of scalability, performance, signalling load and Qos. 3. Air interface - This area focuses on allowing connections to a common IP network over a range of air interfaces as well as offering support for ad-hoc and self provisioned networks at physical and link layer. It will also study spectrum issues raised by the MIND model of a 4G system and will investigate how to extend the range and the performance of HIPERLAN/2 to make it suitable to a wider range of scenarios. 4. Trials - Key concepts of the MIND architecture will be proven by running trials based on UMTS, wireless LAN and IPv6 testbeds. Thus, the project will gain practical experience in particular on handover mechanisms and QoS negotiation. The four technical areas described above will be supported by the project management (5.) and standardisation and dissemination activities (6.), which aim to secure the acceptance and adoption of MIND concepts.  The MIND work carried out in the different areas will be based on results of the IST project BRAIN.

SICMA-EAST provides a still picture library using Internet technology and the JTIP compression method for high quality presentation. A scaleable European server for Internet, multimedia and VoD. A base for the development of a generic framework for virtual museum applications. Visibility by demonstrating advanced technology to the public (VR in museum, multimedia on interactive CATV) Expected Impact The chance for European Industry to enter the server market.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables A scaleable interactive server system for the delivery of images, data and continuous multimedia information. Implementationof DAVIC 1.0 standard and also the Internet standards RTSP, HTTP and HTML. Demonstration within a number of different network environments, namely ATM, ADSL and Internet. Contribution to the programme Demonstration of scalable multimedia server  Technical Approach The main objective is to develop a scaleable server for VoD, multimedia and the Internet. For SICMA-West, the server will implement the DAVIC 1.0 standard, thus the server elements (Service Gateway, Stream etc..), external interfaces (based on DSM-CC), information flows (e.g MPEG-2 TS over ATM) and the protocol stack (IDL, UNO etc..), as specified in the DAVIC 1.0 standard, are supported. The MHEG standard is used for the presentation of the application. For SICMA-EAST, The server system will take up the standards of the WWW service on the Internet. Thus the HTTP protocol will be used for the communication between the user clients and the server. The information will be presented using HTML. Summary of Trial Within SICMA-WEST two trial phases are performed. The objective of the first trial is to demonstrate the server in an ATM network. The aim is to demonstrate the servers ability to supply multimedia to a high-end Virtual Reality application and also to use Pan-European ATM networks to connect two servers giving users access to all information stored on both servers this way. The objective of the second trial is to prove the scalability of the server by integrating it into a CATV network. This trial involves private users accessing the system from home. For SICMA-EAST two trial phases will be performed. Both will use 64 kbps X.21 communication as these are the only reliable communication lines within East and between East and West Europe at the moment.

InnoSec will produce a unique modular model, together with a roadmap, for implementing and improving innovation management in public and private security end-users create new methodologies and built upon best practices in the sector and other sectors, verified by intra- and extra-project team end-users. The model is unique because there is no similar model devoted to security organisations. It will comprise the four phases of innovation: monitoring, evaluation, adaptation and feedback. It has been chosen to be modular to facilitate adoption and internal capability to undergo changes. Customary tools like technology watch, road mapping, and forecast, will be adapted to the security sector context. The roadmap will propose building blocks that will combine innovation modules and complementary pieces dealing with human-centred and motivational aspects, together with considerations of the organisation’ culture, and will include training materials. Every phase of the research, including the final results, is consistently contrasted with the opinions of distinguished experts and end-users coming from different areas of the Security services, maintaining public-private, regional sensibilities, operational-research, and gender balances. The consortium is composed of a combination of RTOs, academic researchers and end-users from across Europe. End-users cover three different areas of the security sector, including public, private and NGOs, regionally diverse and operating nationally and internationally. The two-year effort of InnoSec is planned to be given continuity through an observatory of security innovation, associated to the activities of the Eurotech Security Research Group and open to other stakeholders in the Security research field.'",1,1
549,53635,No,Business Environment of Biometrics involved in electronic commerce,"BEE will investigate the elements that impede the business environment involved in electronic commerce from using biometric technologies for its security. BEE aims at identifying barriers, bottlenecks and proposing scenarios for creating a secure e-commerce business environment favourable to biometric technologies.  The BEE project will also identify the social and economic impacts of using biometric technologies in the security of electronic commerce in the next decade, and it will quantify and demonstrate evolution scenarios, evaluating the social and economic impacts of the biometrics technologies and electronic commerce services on work and business. BEE is separated into two phases: During the first phase of BEE, we developed a desk research report, capturing the present situation in the biometrics field. This report was the outcome of an extensive research on technological, legal, standardization, business and societal aspects of biometrics. We also created two questionnaires concerning these aspects and invited players from all sectors (from experts/manufacturers to common users) to answer them. Processing the answers we created reports using statistical models, capturing the present situation as described by survey. We organized a meeting, inviting experts in biometrics and constructed scenarios, forecasting the future of biometrics, in order to identify barriers and threats that would impede there wide spread. Finally we conducted a benchmark of legal, societal, standardization and business issues in Europe versus the US and Japan. In the second phase of the project, business and marketing aspects of biometrics are being studied. A report will be developed on marketing barriers arising from technical, legal, and standardization perspective and we will draw marketing and business strategies to overcome these barriers in order to exploit and promote biometrics in Europe. In particular we will examine problems (technical, pricing, market readiness, big brother, standards, criminal contention, hardware availability) that all biometrics face, and the various marketing and business strategies that can be followed in order to overcome these problems (e.g. promote biometrics not as a stand-alone solution but as an integrated secure business solution). Such strategies aim to help the manufacturers to promote these technologies.  Preliminary results will be presented in the BEE's Advisory group meeting in order to evaluate and enhance them. The final report will present the various efforts (e.g. projects, initiatives, standards, IST meetings) and results for promoting biometrics. The barriers, proposed solutions, open issues, recommendations for the promotion of biometrics will be reported as found from BEE and all other sources (e.g. projects, initiatives).  An evolving advisory committee called Biowork will support the partners of the project and enhance the project's outcome.

D6.1B Benchmark of Europe versus the US and Japan: This study identified constraints and requirements concerning the use of biometrics for e-commerce. Additionally it formulated recommendations for the European Commission to stimulate the use of biometrics for e-commerce. Insight in the requirements is presented by means of comparison of the European situation with the situation in the USA and Japan. The benchmarking study clarifies which differences exist between two benchmarking partners, how big the difference gap is and what the reasons are for the size of the gap. D6.2 Marketing & Business strategies: Although this is not a technological deliverable, it contains an important amount of information regarding technological issues. The report sets the strategic reasons (criteria) for selecting the most promising markets for biometrics. Technological applications in the promising markets cover an extensive range and variety; commensurate with the wide spectrum of relevant business needs amenable to e-commerce business models and solutions. This observation led us to set a framework for identifying which particular biometrics technologies are most applicable, and can thus add most value, to the mentioned business applications in the promising markets. This framework was used in the case studies in order to elaborate the intended marketing & business development strategies in terms of product mix. D7.1 Conclusions & Recommendations: In this deliverable, we present the final conclusions of the BEE project, paying particular attention to issues like interoperability, usability, ethnicity, scalability and performance issues, and to societal questions, particularly privacy concerns. We provide a list of possible attacks, against a biometric system and suggest ways that these could be dealt with. We review the business landscape relevant to biometrics technology, and we identify potential areas where the industry should be active and demonstrate competence. We also point at promising applications and necessary steps the users and the industry should take in order to achieve wide-scale acceptance of biometrics products. We identify impediments for the wide acceptance of e-government systems and provide recommendations on avenues of action that should be taken prior to establishing a base for e-government applications. We focus on the areas of citizen ID cards, health care and on-line access for the citizens to e-government infrastructure, providing specific recommendations for each area, and generic suggestions that could be utilized for rejuvenating the e-government landscape.",0,0
372,5577,No,Study of Noise and Aerodynamics of Advanced Propellers,"The long-term objective of the SNAAP project is to enable The European aircraft industry to design quieter propeller-driven aircraft providing for improved passenger comfort and reduced environmental noise.   For propeller-driven systems, considerable effort is required to understand the mechanisms responsible for the noise generation on the propeller blade and for the associated mathematic modelling.   The main objectives of this project are:   the identification of the acoustic sources on advanced propeller and propfans,  modelling the mechanisms responsible for the sound generation and its propagation,  development and validation of an aeroacoustic code capable of predictions of propeller noise in the near field and far field.  To achieve this, two propeller configurations will be investigated. The first will be an advanced propeller designed for a cruise Mach number of 0.7 and the second a swept propfan type operating at a cruise Mach number of 0.8 such as has been designed during the pilot phase of the Brite/Euram Gemini project.   The proposed objectives will be accomplished by a series of specific tasks which will address the required theoretical and experimental development aspects and will define the scaling philosophy, the design, manufacture and instrumentation of propeller models capable of withstanding the stress due to the test conditions. In addition, the testing procedures and techniques for the analysis of the acoustic, aerodynamic and vibration data to be acquired in the tests will be established. In parallel with this the theoretical activity will develop both an aerodynamic and an acoustic code. The former will be based on Euler techniques and will provide input data essential for the acoustic code.

Summary of the Action:  The SOLAREC action contributes to the implementation of renewable energy in the European Union as a sustainable and long-term energy supply by undertaking new S&T developments in fields where harmonisation is required and requested by customers and by developing standards and references to ensure the quality of 1st and 2nd generation photovoltaic technology. SOLAREC also acts as a catalyst for the development of the science base of 3rd generation photovoltaic technology with particular attention to integrating the scientific knowledge available in Candidate Countries. This action focuses mainly on: 1. The first generation technology (Crystalline Silicon), by measurements on efficient use of existing supplies and identification of alternatives to conventional silicon feedstock and by the type approval and quality assurance of commercial photovoltaic products; 2. The second generation technology (Thin Films), by development of advanced characterisation methods which take into account specific features of the devices developed, by assessing on a technical base the new production and encapsulation methods and by undertaking harmonisation of standard proposals for the application of these 2nd generation materials; 3. The third generation technology, which will achieve the ultimate goal of high efficiency (up to 80%) or provide low cost alternatives. This action will contribute with dedicated research on plastic/organic solar cells (low cost option) to the variety of options, which will be investigated. This work will be carried out in collaboration with networks within Europe and world-wide; 4. In October 2003, this action will organise an international workshop on the Path to Ultra High efficiency photovoltaics. Rationale Photovoltaic solar electricity is currently growing world-wide by almost 50% per annum and the European policy goal is to increase the share of this particular renewable energy technology 100 fold by 2010, compared to the 1997 situation. Overall the SOLAREC action contributes to the development of fair and transparent markets through the development of standards.

305,32322,No,Objects for critical business applications,"The goal of the project is to provide object-oriented DBMS technology for mission critical business applications. There is an increasing number of business applications which are advancing towards more complex data like picture, text, graphics and/or object oriented design and development tools. Nevertheless they retain the requirements of mission critical applications like large scale multi-user capabilities, search capabilities, performance, robustness, etc.  The benefits of object data management for commercial applications are:  - the reduction of application design, development, maintenance and evolution costs and - the improvement of the performance of the resulting application when dealing with complex objects.  Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) now dominate the mainstream market for business applications. After a decade of tuning and optimisation they now deliver the level of performance, robustness and availability required by many business applications. However, RDBMS offer only very simple data structures and no data behaviour. They are badly suited for applications dealing with complex objects and integration with object tools and languages is difficult. Both the need for a richer data model and the emergence of object technology (OT) in the commercial market has resulted a strong demand for DBMS to manage objects directly.  On the other hand OT, previously a niche technology for departmental technical application domains, has begun to enter the mainstream commercial market. Indicators for this are: major investments of large software vendors, spreading out of OT into most end user areas and rapid development of standardisation bodies (OMG, ODMG). However, Object-Oriented DBMS must satisfy the requirements of large scale commercial applications in terms of performance and availability.  Leading European RDBMS and ODBMS vendors are now working together on this subject. This presents a unique opportunity The approach is to further develop each of the DBMSs, that represents proven technology in its area, with the complementary technology of the partner. Approaching the final goal of a mission critical OODBMS in those different ways will support rapid progress in the subject.  Technical implementation is structured into two phases. In the first phase pieces of technology available from Software AG and O2 Technology will be integrated. In the second the project will concentrate on developing and improving technology that addresses the necessary performance, robustness and availability for mission-critical applications.  The results of this project will be two DBMS prototypes - an object-oriented RDBMS from Software AG and a 'pure' OODBMS from O2 Technology - as well as the implementation of two large scale commercial applications using these DBMS prototypes - OMINIDIAL, the Electronic Directory (ED) product line of CAP SESA TELECOM and Object Distributed Billing Engine (ODBE) from Mannesmann Datenverarbeitung GmbH.  The results of the project will be a European object-relational DBMS for commercial applications marketed by Software AG and based on O2's technology and a European OODBMS marketed by O2 Technology enhanced with performance and reliability attributes based on Software AG's technology.  By joining their technical excellence and market expertise, Software AG and O2 Technology plan to be in a situation of world-wide technological leadership and to turn the partnership into world-wide market successes. Joint information dissemination will be done through international database conferences and industrial object conferences. For exploitation the partners will use their existing marketing and sales channels.  The results are targeted at the emerging market for DBMSs which combine object capabilities with relational functionality. Software AG will first address the traditional MIS market (the current Software AG core business), such as banks and insurance etc.; O2 Technology will strengthen its position in the technical application world (telecommunication, nuclear, defence, industry, etc.).  http://www.softwareag.com",0,0
723,46570,No,Digital interactive satellite terminal for master antenna systems in the third millennium,"Main Objective  S3M aims to develop innovative and efficient technological solutions for small SMATV systems. The key objectives are:    -To produce cost efficient prototypes for interactive systems on small SMATV installations reaching the 10% target cost recommended by the DVB. The network architecture is the combination of a universal satellite link with an innovative technological mechanism for the coaxial section of a SMATV installation.    -The development of optimised protocols for satellite access in a scenario of a massive number of Satellite Interactive Terminals simultaneously accessing the satellite where Traffic Models predict 'avalanche effects'.    -The development of end-to-end delivery protocols for interactive applications and for massive data delivery at asymmetric data rates.    -To validate this pre-operational equipment and perform field trials in end to end chains.    -To create a strategic position for concertated actions on satellite based interactive systems Technical approach  S3M (SMATV in the Third Millennium) will develop pre-operational equipment for the short term deployment of Satellite based Interactive systems and services in a SMATV environment. The focus will be on small SMATV systems because these have stringent cost constraints on the headend equipment if they are to be acceptable to users. These requirements lead to more efficient technologies.  The key advantage of a satellite based interactive system for SMATV is that the Satellite Interactive Terminal is shared by several users living in a single building. It provides a very low cost interactive solution within the range of the target costs for DVB interactive systems whilst exploiting the flexibility and advantages of satellite communications. The S3M system prepares the way for broadband scaleable access systems which can allow QoS on demand through the satellite.  S3M will focus on user and system requirements and user needs as well as on a business plan for small SMATV networks. It takes as the starting point the conclusions of earlier RACE and ACTS projects on satellite based interactivity (DIGISMATV and DIGISAT). The added value of S3M will be the provision of solutions for small SMATV systems with 10-20 users, which is regarded as a strategic for Europe. This view is also held by the European DVB Consortium. Broadcasters, Network Operators and satellite operators will be involved in the requirement analysis. Cost analysis will aim to reach the Satellite Interactive Terminal target price (costs) of under $500 for production volumes of several millions (the potential market for Europe).  S3M will develop and validate pre-operational demonstrators of Satellite Interactive Terminals based on FTDMA (Frequency and Time Division Multiple Access) system access. These will be compared with the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) systems analysed by the earlier DIGISAT project, in order to decide the best system approach for a satellite based interaction channel. The advantages and disadvantages of the two access techniques will be assessed to determine the most efficient and cost effective option as a function of the SMATV type and application. .  S3M will provide a platform for integrating both technologies in field trials: FTDMA, developed within S3M and CDMA, developed under the sponsorship of ESA. S3M will also develop and test pre-operational demonstrators of coaxial quipment optimised for the small SMATV environment. This will be based on the Low rate TDMA approach defined by DIGISAT, where the Grouping Terminal is as simple as the Interactive Interface Module (IIM) at the user terminal. It is intended to provide stand-alone IIMs, allowing the use of universal IRDs in the introductory period.  S3M will validate the results through trialing some attractive Interactive TV applications integrating, among other applications, satellite based Internet Multimedia Services.  Summary of Trial  S3M Trials will be arranged with users that already are enjoying Satellite Digital Television broadcasting services. A number of users will be selected to evaluate the enhanced interactive services provided by S3M Satellite based Interactive Systems in an scenario of PC based Satellite Internet Multimedia Services.

One of the main challenges of transforming Europe´s economy will be the integration of highly volatile renewable energy sources (RES). Especially hydrogen produced from RES will have a major part in decarbonizing the industry, transport and energy sector – as feedstock, fuel and/or energy storage.  However, access to renewable electricity will also be a limiting factor in the future and energy efficient technologies the key. Due to a significant energy input in form of steam preferably from industrial waste heat, Steam Electrolysis (StE) based on Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) achieves outstanding electrical efficiencies of up to 84 %el,LHV. Thus, StE is a very promising technology to produce hydrogen most energy efficiently.   GrInHy2.0 will demonstrate how steam electrolysis in an industrial relevant size can: • Be integrated into the industrial environment at an integrated iron-and-steel works with a StE unit of 720 kWAC and electrical efficiency of up to 84 %el, LHV • Operate at least 13,000 hours with a proved availability of >95 % • Provide a significant amount of hydrogen (18 kg/h) while meeting the high-quality standards for steel annealing processes  • Produce at least 100 tons of green hydrogen at a targeted price of 7 €/kg to substitute hydrogen based on fossil fuels  • Support the most promising Carbon Direct Avoidance (CDA) approach by substituting the reducing agent carbon by green hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the steel production  In context with the production of green hydrogen from a steam electrolyser, the steel industry combines both hydrogen and oxygen demand – today and future – and the availability of cost-efficient waste heat from its high-temperature production processes.",1,0

These scientific discoveries can help address many of the grand challenges our society is facing, but unfortunately, too few of these new materials are implemented in real commercial devices. This is not because of a lack of interest or commercial potential, but often because there are no manufacturing methods available that allow for controlled processing of these materials at scale.   This project aims to address this challenge by developing advanced nano and microstructures directly on a scalable Roll-to-Roll manufacturing platform, rather than considering manufacturing as an after-thought. This will be achieved by following a methodical approach, where material organisation is optimised from the bottom-up, starting with the nanoscale chemical material composition, followed by the microscale particle morphology, and finally their large area coating using Roll-to-Roll manufacturing. This hierarchical material build-up will be achieved by taking advantage of emerging scientific insights in robust self-assembly processes, combined with novel coating processes to allow for precise control over the particle flow and assembly on Roll-to-Roll.   Our Roll-to-Roll process will be optimised to manufacture Li-Ion batteries with new form factors that allow the enhancement of their volumetric performance. This project will demonstrate for the first time how complex hierarchical battery electrodes can be manufactured with a continuous process. These batteries are important to support the EU’s strong automotive industry as it transitions to electric vehicles, and therefore this project will contribute to the EU economy as well as to the de-carbonisation of our society.",0,0

518,207647,No,Planet ROlling Bearing with Advanced TEchnologies,"The development of Ultra High Propulsive Efficiency (UHPE) engine is a key factor to fulfil the main milestones of the Sustainable And Green Engines (SAGE) program: high environmental benefits of UHPE will be reached through a power gearbox decoupling fan and turbine speeds. Such innovation raises different technological challenges: the increase of the rotational speed and harsh lubrication conditions due to the centrifugal field. In terms of power gearbox performance and reliability, the design and lubrication of the rolling bearings, crucial components, can affect the gearbox and engine architectures.  The scope of PROBATE is “to predict bearing behaviour (through dynamic, lubrication & thermal coupled modelling) and develop various planet rolling bearing technologies, overcoming current design rules of aero-engine bearings enabling the development of a UHPE engine”. Specific objectives are: - To develop a new numerical model able to predict heat generation and transfer in the planet bearing taking into account interactions between dynamics, lubricant and thermal behaviours - To develop an optimized profile ceramic roller, a specific polymer cage design and an optimized lubrication solution as well as their integration in the new planet bearing - To demonstrate -30% in power loss & oil flow and -15% of the bearing weight in comparison to the current baseline solution & increasing at the same time the reliability.

752,53655,No,Efficient millimetre broadband radio access for convergence and evolution,"The main objective of the EMBRACE project is to develop a low cost broadband wireless access system and services based on the results obtained during LMDS-trials under the ACTS program. In particular, inputs from users and operators regarding present and future access capacity demands and requirements for availability and quality of service will be used. The system will operate in the 40.5-42.5 GHz (43.5 GHz) bands and can easily be adopted for operation in other bands in the millimetre frequency range, allocated for this type of services. However, the indoor user's terminal can be used for a wide range of frequencies above about 20 GHz, suitable for broadband applications. In providing a low-cost fixed radio access technology all the benefits of the current Information Technology revolution will be delivered without requiring any broadband cable systems.  Objectives: The main goal is to develop a low cost radio access system for the mass market. This will be achieved through efficient utilisation of radio frequency bands and optimisation of transmission capacities for a variety of users and usage. A prototype will be developed using MPEG-2 in the downlink and an uplink using multiple frequency time division multiple access. Time division duplex will be studied as an alternative to the frequency division duplex, realised in the hardware prototype. Star and mesh network allowing for network capacity growth as business grows, will be studied. The access network shall inter-operate and multiplex effectively with other common networks. Solutions allowing for nomadic users and route diversity (switching between two or more sase stations) will be developed. Planning tools that take into account obstruction from the topography and man-made structures, the effects of atmospheric propagation conditions and the antenna radiation patterns, will be developed.  Work description: The project is based on the ACTS programme, which identified a need for improvement of return link in the access systems and coverage. The project consists of three main areas: access system, network interaction, and network availability and performance. The work covers a total solution for broadband access based on radio technology. The radio based solution will be designed to easily inter-operate with other broadband solutions, and the backbone infrastructure as well. Prototype systems will be developed and tested in real scenarios. The workgroup on 'Access system' will concentrate on the topics from the last switching point to the users. This includes provision of a large variety of transmission capacities on demand and frequency efficient modulation and coding techniques based on chosen frequency and channel plans. The workgroup on 'Network interconnection' will concentrate on topics on the 'last switching point' interaction with other base stations, other access networks and backbone infrastructure.  Topologies such as star and mesh networks will be investigated in order to obtain an optimal solution, allowing for network capacity growth as business grows. The workgroup on 'Network availability and performance' will focus on radio service coverage and performance. Efficient use of frequency and optimised channel planning are of crucial importance, in particular when traffic volume approaches system saturation. The workgroup will develop planning tools that take into account the characteristics of the available frequency bands, obstruction from the topography and by man-made structures, the effect of atmospheric propagation conditions and the antenna radiation patterns.  Milestones: The outcome from the EMBRACE project will enhance European export potential through generating a growth industry. The project will concentrate on the 40.5 to 42.5 GHz (43.5 GHz) bands, but the access system planning tools will also be applicable to other bands above 20 GHz. Contributions will be sent to regulatory and standards bodies. It will also contribute in promoting the concepts of broadband wireless access in the discussions of the FP5 programme. The project has achieved all major goals. All planned deliverables have been provided and appropriate dissemination has so far been done. EMBRACE has integrated the full experimental system on site and was demonstrated to the public at an international workshop arranged in Norway in 2002. Part of the system was demonstrated during IBC 2001 in Amsterdam. Management has performed as planned and management routines followed. The results form the basis for exploitation as indicated by the individual partners, and should have a significant impact on the development of broadband fixed wireless access systems, their deployment and equipment manufacturing. Broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) system. The project has expressed a detailed view on system requirements for a broadband fixed radio access system that can become a mass-market product as well as provide a solution for small and medium business, home office and organisations. Prototype equipment for complete base stations and user stations based on an MF-TDMA access scheme and a DVB-S downlink for combined transport of TV and data has been built.  It all functioned very well. AccessFor the investigation of TDD versus FDD it has been concluded that TDD offers great advantages under operating conditions with individual traffic (not TV dominated traffic) of varying degree of asymmetry. It offers flexibility and increased capacity relative to FDD and the problems of interference can be solved. The burst demodulation is not as unfavourable as commonly assumed and equipment may be manufactured cheaper compared to FDD. An important part of a broadband radio access system is the medium access control (MAC). The project's views are applicable to the prototype experimental equipment as well as for the future system. An important point here is the ability of handling thousands for users per basic radio cell or base station. Work on multiplexing introduced possibilities for priority control and cost reduction. Synchronisation have been analysed in detail and extended to include the route diversity situation, and the improvements by the use of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology. Adaptive modulation and coding is an area leading to improved spectral efficiency for the individual traffic. Networking and interoperability Networking aspects, including IP-based traffic for the users, addressed to both reach the mass market with a low cost solution, as well as providing business users high availability. The interconnection network has been fully defined using multi-protocol label switching (MPLS). Performance measurements have been taken as well. The important idea of path diversity and 'shadow flows' has been verified for improved availability and support nomadic users. A generalisation of the 'shadow flow' principle has been made with particular reference to cellular systems.  Important bandwidth saving techniques as multicast and broadcast on demand have been analysed (Deliverable D14) including new efficient multicast software. Interoperability with GSM/UMTS/GPRS (Deliverable D4), cable networks and satellite has been studied. Satellite interoperability was demonstrated connecting the master cell in Norway with a remote user over satellite (DVB-RCS standard) at the IST Event in Copenhagen 2002. Service availability, coverage and utilisation.  A new cell-planning tool for BFWA networks has been developed. The tool incorporates innovative meta-heuristic optimisation methods (such as Tabu search), allows a number of optimisation criteria (including criteria based on financial models) and a wide range of network variables and constraints to be explored. A number of the output products required for commercial deployment have been included as well as test cases studied. Rain diversity data have been collected, and a general statistical rain diversity model developed for network planning purposes. Also, a hardware simulator for rain fading has been completed ready for use within the diversity system development and trials. A practical demonstration of countermeasures against distortion on the radio path caused by vegetation (tree) effects has been made using a diversity combiner. A study on the broadband service requirements, markets and constraints in Eastern Europe was carried out in the western part of Romania.",0,0
664,194174,No,REfactoring Parallel Heterogeneous Resource-Aware Applications  - a Software Engineering Approach,"'The RePhrase project directly meets the challenge of ICT-09-2014, by studying the critically important issue of improving software development practice for parallel data-intensive applications. Data-intensive applications are among the most important and commonly encountered kinds of industrial application, and are increasingly important with the emergence of 'big data' problems. Emerging heterogeneous parallel architectures form ideal platforms to exploit the massive-scale inherent parallelism that is usually implicit in such applications, but which is often difficult to extract in practice.  Solving this problem will bring major economic benefits to the software industry. To address this challenge, RePhrase brings together a team of leading industrial and academic researchers, software engineers, systems developers, parallelism experts and domain experts from large companies, SMEs and leading universities. It aims to develop a novel software engineering methodology for developing complex, large-scale parallel data-intensive applications, supported by a very high-level programming model. We will exploit advanced pattern-based programming, refactoring, testing, debugging, verification and adaptive-scheduling technologies to build an interoperable tool-chain supporting our methodology, based on but significantly extending existing industrial and research tools. These tools will significantly ease, and even automate, all phases of typical software development, from design and implementation to long-term maintenance and software evolution. The generality of our approach will be ensured by targeting C\\ and the most popular low-level parallel programming models, such as the C\\11/14/17 standards, pthreads, OpenMP, Intel TBB, OpenCL and CUDA.  We will demonstrate our approach on a range of large-scale data-intensive applications, taken from different domains, including bio-medical image processing, data analysis, machine learning, computer vision and railway diagnosis.'",0,0

18,109051,Yes,Developing Innovative Outreach and Dialogue on responsible nanotechnologies in EU civil society,"Stakeholder engagement and dialogue are essential to the responsible development of nanotechnologies in Europe. NANODIODE establishes an innovative, coordinated programme for outreach and dialogue throughout Europe to support the effective governance of nanotechnologies. The project integrates vital engagement activities along the innovation value chain: it combines ‘upstream’ public engagement (by way of dialogues that integrate societal needs and expectations into the policy debate) with ‘midstream’ engagement (by organising open innovation workshops at the level of R&D) and ‘downstream’ strategies for education and communication.  The overall objectives of NANODIODE are to: • Develop new strategies for outreach and dialogue along nanotechnology value chains; • Organise engagement and dialogue at the 'upstream' level of research policy; • Enable processes of co-creation during research and innovation; • Professionalise nanotechnology education and training; • Establish an innovative programme for outreach and communication on nanotechnologies; • Assess the impact of the project’s activities and provide policy feedback with a view to Horizon 2020.  The consortium brings together a strong network of partners from various backgrounds and extending across Europe (representing academia, industry, civil society, education and communication). Many partners bring their experience as coordinators of earlier European projects (such as NANOCODE, NANOREG, NANOEIS, NANOCAP, NANOPLAT, OBSERVATORY NANO, NANOPINION, NANOCHANNELS and NANOBIORAISE). This will allow the project to look back and identify best practices based on existing experience - and developing new, innovative models and tools for outreach and dialogue when necessary. The project will also look ahead: as Horizon 2020 unfolds, the project will provide best practices for the effective governance of nanotechnologies in Europe.",1,1
32,46605,Yes,Broadband trial integration,"Main Objective   BTI will demonstrate the role of quality of service (QoS) on IP over ATM for optimising the requirements for network resources and improving the perception of internet services offered to users. The project will develop an integrated IPv6 and switched ATM network with multicast capabilities and well defined QoS support of user controlled bandwidth and delay. The effect of network performance on the perception of the user with QoS control will be evaluated using educational applications adapted for the project.   Technical Approach BTI will enhance simple PVC based ATM networks with QoS support by integrating IPv6 and ATM in the existing field trials of the project Broadbandloop (AC038) being carried out in Portugal, Denmark and Poland. Existing educational applications will be adapted to support QoS control. Schools, universities and teachers participating in the trials will be provided with educational applications, such as telelearning. These applications will be used to evaluate the various aspects of QoS perception, and the impact of technical performance related to QoS on end user (with QoS control) satisfaction. The outcome will provide an input to the production of guidelines and standards in this area. The project has three main phases:    -Phase 1 establishes the basic technical platform at the three trial sites where applications are installed and connectivity verified. Routers with IPv6 over ATM are installed in the networks, and system integration of PIM for IPv4 with the RSVP Controlled Load Service (mapped onto the ATM UNI 3.1 CBR Service) is carried out. An inventory of QoS settings is then built (based on the IPv6 over ATM networks) that could be used to vary the QoS in the subsequent phases. International interconnections based on ISDN will be established to verify connectivity between users in the three countries. Negotiations with teachers will be undertaken to identify the applications most suitable for the users in the trials.    -Phase 2 implements ATM UNI 4.0 signalling and management in the router and in the backbone switches, and integrates the PIM for IPv6 with RSVP, where the Controlled Load Service will be mapped onto an ABR Service. Furthermore, application packages with QoS control are implemented, and system integration test in the lab is carried out. Finally, software used in the field trials and user terminals is installed. Demonstrations, tests and evaluation of performance will be performed, and a series of user trials will be conducted to measure user perception of QoS as a function of network settings.    -Phase 3 completes the development of the integrated IPv6/ATM protocols. In addition, the RSVP Guaranteed Delay Service (mapped onto ATM UNI 4.0 Guaranteed Delay Service) and the NHRP Protocol for IPv6 over ATM are implemented. Application packages are installed and system integration are performed. A series of user trials, demonstrations, performance evaluations similar to those in phase 2 are conducted.  The international interconnections between sites will be PVC based ATM networks over which UNI 4.0 SVCs will be used for bandwidth management. The QoS parameters over these PVC connections will be evaluated. Between Poland and Denmark connectivity will be made via an existing fibre over which two ATM switches/routers will be connected. Between Portugal and Denmark a connection will be established for intermittent test runs via TEN-34 or QUANTUM. None of the application tests require actual connectivity between countries, which may be performed on a national basis, and ATM connectivity may be established alongside ISDN and Internet connectivity.   Summary of the Trials   The trials in the three countries will be conducted on the network established by the Broadbandloop project and other existing pre-commercial trials, which at the moment provides only simple PVC connectivity to users. The QoS support will be implemented in phases as described previously. A summary of the trial in each country is given below.   Trial Site in Poland:  The trial infrastructure consists of a PON to provide POTS, ISDN and ATM based broadband services to the users. Broadband services will also be provided over VDSL modems. Multimedia retrieval services for education and training purposes will be implemented. A Video On Demand (VoD) server will be installed and connected to the field trial.   Trial Site in Denmark:  Services for small and medium business customers, municipal and educational institutions, a hospital and a university will be provided. The trial will encompass an ADSL field trial, the Broadbandloop field trial with VDSL/FTTB and the Tele Danmark Media Center (TMC) with 4 ADSL modems. The ADSL trial is presently running on a non-commercial basis, with the intention to run it as a pre-commercial trial with some user payment.   Trial site in Portugal:  Users in the trial are residential users, a university, schools in Aveiro and Lisbon and a hospital. The Broadbandloop infrastructure will provide broadband services to the users through a PON system and xDSL. The services provided by the national host will be Internet access, distributed video using MPEG2 over ATM, VOD and LAN to LAN interconnection.  Educational application with QoS control Expected Achievements   Development and evaluation of an integrated IPv6 and ATM concept with user control of QoS   Expected Impact   The results obtained from testing and evaluation of the integrated IPv6 and ATM concept will be used as contribution to standardisation activities, guidelines for network design and product development.   Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Definition and implementation of a system for controlling the quality of IP based services in an ATM PON access network. IPv6 is integrated with ATM to provide 'Controlled load', 'Guaranteed' and 'Best Effort' services. A 'Next Hop Resolution Protocol' reduces network delay, and multicasting saves network processing and cost. The system was implemented in three field trials in Denmark, Portugal and Poland, interconnected through the Pan European ATM network.

53,14408,Yes,Mobile Experimental Broadband Interconnection Using Satellites,"The project focuses on key applications for fully mobile, world-wide broadband communications which are only possible via satellite communications. The approach chosen is applicable to any region lacking the appropriate terrestrial network infrastructure, and marine use. Voice, data, still and motion video are supported in an integrated multimedia arrangement. The aim is to demonstrate viable services at tariffs no more than twice that for (analogue) satellite telephony. The research focuses on key applications for fully mobile broadband communication on a world wide scale. This kind of universal coverage can only be provided by a satellite communication network. The research addresses applications that may be supported using space segments available today, or emerging during the course of the research. An example is provision of support to a ship's crew from a shore side service centre, to solve unexpected technical problems related to ship machinery, medical or environmental matters and other emergencies. The chosen approach may be applied to any region lacking the appropriate terrestrial network infrastructure (ie construction sites or industrial plants in deserted, rural or underdeveloped regions).  Voice, data, still and (compressed) full motion video are supported in an integrated multimedia arrangement. The objective was to demonstrate viable services at communication tariffs which do not markedly exceed those for ordinary telephone calls (to fully mobile users).  The research has resulted in the detailed specification of 3 pilot applications: remote assistance to a water dam construction in Greece; remote monitoring for a bow loading oil cargo vessel in Finland; a containerized version of a support station for acceptance test runs of newly built ships. Preliminary results are available on the feasibility investigation of a short range digital radio link for increased usage flexibility for the multimedia application on board. Technical Approach   Transmission is based on the 'High Speed Data' option of the Inmarsat satellite network giving world-wide coverage for mobile users at duplex 64kbit/s, later extended to n x 64 kbit/s (n less than or equal to 6) in an asymmetric duplex configuration. For the broadband option European public ground earth satellite stations are connected to ISDN providing mobile access to any ISDN subscriber (n x 64 kbit/s presently limited to reserve mode). Mobile-to-mobile communication is provided by connecting two such space segments via ISDN.   Application flexibility and user acceptance are enhanced by the development of a 64 kbit/s (later n x 64 kbit/s) extension radio link between the satellite terminal and the area to be monitored (e.g. the ship's engine room below the water-line). This avoids the costly local area cable network.   Key Issues   - Preparation and testing of the pilot application of Inmmarsat High Speed Data capability connected to ISDN - Extension to mobile-to-mobile communication by connecting sequential space segments via ISDN and allowing full multimedia functionalities. - Extension to n x 64 kbit/s interfaces. - Realisation of a radio link between a satellite terminal and a multimedia station - Development/adaptation of multimedia conferencing tools for the addressed marine and terrestrial applications. - Set-up and integration of a containerised mobile satellite and multimedia stations for marine and terrestrial use. - Application scenario demonstrations and the assessment of user acceptance and market trends.   Expected Impact   Recent terminals of the 18000 mobile Standard-A ship terminals in use world-wide may be retrofitted with the new data communications option. For new equipment the extra costs for this option are rather modest. User and press reaction to the various demonstrations is encouraging. It is therefore expected that the new service and application areas will find a market within the relatively short term. Recently a leading supplier of diesel engines started to offer their customers remote assistance via broadband multimedia communication according to the MOEBIUS concept.",0,1
1008,205213,No,VINYL AND HETEROARYL BORONIC ACIDS AS NON-STABILIZED NUCLEOPHILES IN RHODIUM-CATALYZED DYNAMIC KINETIC TRANSFORMATIONS,"The formation of carbon-carbon bonds in an asymmetric fashion is a very useful process in synthetic chemistry, since it generates single enantiomers of chiral molecules at the same time as the molecular framework is being assembled. In this context, two strategies for the generation of single enantiomer compounds using enantioselective catalysis have been widely emabraced: on the one hand, the use of prochiral substrates, and on the other hand, the use of racemic substrates in enantiomer resolution processes, which limits the yields up to 50%. An efficient variation of this second strategy is to couple enantiomer differentiation with interconversion of enantiomers. However, these  dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations (DYKAT) have been limited to the use of stabilized nucleophiles. Very recently, the group of Fletcher reported that alkylzirconium reagents can be employed as non-stabilized nucleophiles in combination with a copper-based catalytic system for this class of processes. Subsequently, the same group demonstrated that arylboronic acids are also suitable substrates in rhodium-catalyzed DYKATs. The project presented in this application aims to expand the scope of this powerful transformation by using vinyl- and heteroarylboronic acids as non-stabilized nucleophiles in the rhodium-catalyzed DYKAT. Moreover, a thorough study of the reaction mechanism will be conducted, as well as the investigation on alternative procedures for this process (catalytic systems, nature of the substrates, etc) that might result in useful applications for organic synthesis.",0,0
421,195598,No,Nanowires to study single synapses in patterned neuronal networks.,"In neuronal networks of the brain, synapses are the connection points between neurons. The dynamics (or plasticity) of these synapses allow us to think, learn and memorize. A deeper understanding of these phenomena requires investigations of single synapses. Synapses have been intensively studied in vivo but in such studies the physiological complexity limits the investigations at the single synapses level.    Despite tremendous technical and conceptual advances of in vivo studies, we miss (1) a better understanding of the mechanics of synapses formation; (2) observing directly the chemical activity at single synapses; (3) investigating the role of neuronal network topology in synaptic plasticity. These classical limitations can now be overcome by alternative in vitro approaches, using recent technological advances in microfluidics and nano-technologies.    The aim of NANOSYNNETS is to use vertical arrays of NANOwires (aNWs) to study in vitro the formation and plasticity of single SYnapses in Neuronal NETworkS with controlled topologies.  With my expertise in growing controlled neuronal networks in microfluidic chips, I decided to join the one of the leading group in bio-nanotechnologies, lead by Karen Martinez (KM) and based at the NanoScience Center (NSC) of the University of Copenhagen (UCPH), to exploit novel technologies for the investigation of in vitro single synapse formation, activity and plasticity. This novel approach will give a complementary and cutting-edge point of view to classical in vivo studies of synapses and will thereby provide unmatched insights into neurobiology and will shed new lights on unanswered questions in learning mechanisms or neuronal communication.",0,0

821,57875,No,Web-enabled Information Services for Engineering,"The WISE objective is to enable individuals and organisations in the engineering domain to access and use available information resources more efficiently, and to foster cooperation and communication among distributed teams. This will be achieved through more accessible knowledge assets, which are found and presented quicker, in a context relevant form that allows the worker to focus on quality, productivity and their own competence realisation and evolution.WISE aims at supporting engineers in their daily work with a consistent set of methods and tools as a basis of a 'smart' organisation. WISE will develop a novel open platform of interoperable web-solutions for flexible working in and between the pilot organisation and its business partners. Big importance will also be put on corresponding adaptation of product development processes and corporate culture.   OBJECTIVES WISE will provide a platform for knowledge sharing and management in product development and manufacturing. This platform will not only provide IT tools and methods for handling knowledge assets but will also specify processes and organisational changes to make the smart organisation feasible. WISE will model and analyse workable processes for typical multi-partner networks engaged in product creation. This will help remedy the current situation and make suggestions for adapting the prevailing corporate culture towards a knowledge culture. WISE will build prototypes for improving the learning curve of networked organisations to become 'smart'. The orientation of the technical work is towards the development of efficient and integrated modules for modelling, acquiring, maintaining, retrieving, distributing, and re-using knowledge throughout the complete product development process and all involved partners.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK WISE follows a user-centred iterative approach that enables participative design of networked information services. The project is centred around two prototyping cycles, which provide user feedback and help to validate the architectural and conceptual framework as the building blocks of a smart organisation. The first prototype will be evaluated by the users at the end of the project's first year. Tests with this prototype as well as a formal mid term review of the first phase achievements will provide a solid basis to formulate a stable set of principles and tools necessary for managing knowledge in the networked environment of a smart organisation. The second and final prototype development will take into account these results. The WISE work plan consists of ten work packages:- WP01: Surveys and State of the Art- WP02: User Needs and Functional Requirements for Knowledge-Environment- WP03: Design of Knowledge Process for Engineering- WP04: Concepts for K-Services and Functional Specification of K-Environment- WP05: Detail Specification of K-System Components and Final Architecture- WP06: Implementation of K-System Prototype- WP07: Industrial Testing and Evaluation- WP08: Industrial Introduction Support- WP09: Exploitation and Dissemination- WP10: Project Management and Coordination.",0,0
907,213228,No,High performance intelligent Bottle Bore Tool for machining of the engine drive shaft,"The development of the new Ultra High Propulsive Efficiency (UHPE) engine architecture includes significant changes in the configuration and functioning scheme compared to current technology for the aircraft engines. A main change is the addition of a gearbox to decouple the fan and the turbine rotation, resulting in new requirements for the main turbine shaft (increased RPM and decreased torque); these aspects involve new size and shape needs for this shaft that challenge the current manufacturing methods to achieve an internal bottle bore geometry with Length to Diameter ratio above 30 and length over 2 meters. At this point, the proposal covers the development of new tooling systems to perform the machining of the shaft with the required precision and quality. The main objective of the BBT project is to develop an intelligent tool concept for the internal profiling of the engine drive shaft integrating different technological subsystems that enable the achievement of large Length to Diameter ratio and meeting the aeronautic requirements related to the machined surface condition.",0,0
453,89867,No,Biological rational for the mannosidase super family in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,"The human intestine is colonized by over 10 trillions symbiotic bacteria which play a critical role in human health such as preventing inflammation and cancer.  These microorganisms hydrolyse complex carbohydrates polymers from our diet that are not degraded by “our” own enzymes and thus, in addition to preventing cancer and inflammation, increase the nutrients available to the human host. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the composition of the microorganisms in the large intestines influences fat deposition in the mammalian host demonstrating how these bacteria can alter metabolism in their host. The symbiotic bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomiron is the most abundant microoganism in the large intestine. B. thetaiotaomicron, colonises the gut by accessing both human and dietary complex carbohydrates. It synthesises over 200 glycoside hydrolases which is greater than any other bacterium studied to date indicating that the microorganism exploits complex carbohydrates as an important nutrient source. Intriguingly there has been a significant expansion in glycoside hydrolase families in which the enzymes attack polymers containing the sugar mannose which is present in complex carbohydrates display on the surface of human cells. These carbohydrate structures contain three mannose molecules and are elongated with different combination of other sugars making these complex molecules highly variable. B. thetaiotaomicron produces 23 enzymes in the glycoside hydrolase family GH92 which attacks glycosidic bonds that are linked to mannose sugars and thus they are likely to target the carbohydrates on the surface of human cells. The biological rationale for such a large number of GH92 enzymes may reflect diversity of sugars attached to mannose in human complex carbohydrates. The central objective of this project is to dissect the specificity and the mechanism of carbohydrate recognition of representatives of GH92 B. thetaiotaomicron enzymes.",0,0

78,35887,Yes,Strategic research network systems for multimedia mobile computing,"The objective of the project is to develop key enabling technology to lower the cost per transmitted bit through mobile communication infrastructure by two orders of magnitude compared to today's cost. This is perceived as key to making the multimedia computing ubiquitous and for the European Telecommunication industry to maintain their leading position in the world market.  The mobile communication infrastructure today suffers from two problems. The first problem is the centralised control and management. This increases the complexity of the basestations and entails a very high cabling and maintenance cost. The second problem is that this architecture was not designed to exploit the backbone broadband network.  To overcome this limitations and achieve its objective MEDIA will develop a network architecture that is based on flat distributed switching. This architecture will exploit the distributed processing available in the backbone broadband network for management and control. This will reduce the complexity and thereby the cost and power consumption of the basestations that will be based on such an infrastructure. The infrastructure cost will be further lowered by embedding the key functionalities of the basestations into a highly integrated single chip hardware-software solution using existing processor cores (e.g. SPAClet and ARM OMI-cores) and supercells, and customising it using application-specific hardware co-processor blocks functionalities. Recognising that engineering cost often dominates the overall cost of complex telecommunication systems, MEDIA will adapt the existing hardware software design methods and tools for telecommunication designs to make them more competitive and efficient. The developed system design flow will be encapsulated to significantly reduce the engineering cost for future basestation designs.  The project deliverables will take several forms. Reports documenting the results of investigations about different architectural and design solutions and rationale for selecting one. Design documents describing in detail the design decisions. High level models for verification and system performance level analysis. Simulation results and their analysis. System design flow based on methods and tools extended and dapted in the project. The results of the project will be reported international conferences and disseminated by holding regular workshops.  The exploitation part of the project is led by the system company, ERICSSON Radio Systems AB, who is a world leader in mobile communication infrastructure market. The results that will be produced, as described above, will enable European telecommunication companies like ERICSSON to offer new innovative products and services related to the multimedia mobile computing market. Such results are in line with the foreseen activities of the industrial partner who will require (and benefit significantly from) the above results to deliver the next generation solutions to a strategic target market. This will in turn translate to future business successes and benefits to the company.",0,1
639,37181,No,Wide gap chalcopyrites for advanced photovoltaic devices,"OBJECTIVES   The objective of this project is to develop highly efficient, low-toxic, stable, cost effective thin film solar cells based on CuGaSe2 and CuGaSe2 / CulnSe2 tandem structures. The wide-gap CuGaSe2 (Eg =1.68 eV) based solar cell will be processed at low temperatures and should exceed the best PV parameters, achieved so far. We aim in particular for an open circuit voltage of more than 1 V and a short-circuit current density of more than 15mA/cm2 (under AM1.5 illumination).   TECHNICAL APPROACH   In order to study the influence of source materials and deposition techniques on device performances, MOCVD and PVD will be investigated. Polycrystalline CuGaSe2 and defect chalcopyrite layers will be deposited on glass/Mo and on glass/n\ -ZnO:AI (to form a tunnel junction), and also on glass/p\ -SiC (in order to develop transparent back contacts). For reference reasons the same layers wil be grown on GaAs-substrates by MBE and MOCVD. In some PVD processes various additive materials acting as fluxing agents will be used during the growth of CuGaSe2 thin films (flux-assisted growth). In the MOCVD-system p-CuGaSe2 /n-ZnSe structuires will be deposited in one multilayer-process.  With different characterisation methods a study of material, interface and device properties will be performed. The material quality prior to and after deposition will be analyzed by mass spectrometry and nuclear mass resonance. With the help of ion-beam analysis the hydrogen content depth profile in the complete solar cell structures will be studied quantitatively . The stoichiometric composition at the interface between window layers and CuGaSe2 will be analyze by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) together with sputtering and Rutherford backscattering (RBS). Optoelectronic scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and in-situ photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to investigate the junction formation. The devices will be characterized by spectral response and temperature dependent IV-measurements.   EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION   It is expected that the wide-gap CuGaSe2 based solar cells developed in this project will exhibit better PV parameters than any state-of-the-art wide gap chalcopyrite device processed so far.  If MOCVD-grown wide gap chalcopyrites can be processed into highly efficient solar cells, AIXTRON sees the opportunity to offer MOCVD equipment (with large planetary reactor) and transfer the developed technology with the equipment. The precursor materials developed at EPICHEM could be exploited using batch scale production with a relatively short induction period of 6 to 12 months.",0,0

42,224302,Yes,Wooden structured telecommunications tower for the complete mobile network coverage,"In Europe and globally, the use of wireless communication in 4G and 5G networks is growing, resulting in the need for several thousands of new telecommunication towers (ground based towers ie. GBTs) annually. For serving the antenna and device technology and for answering the requirements of cities, operators and changing climate, the lifecycle of telecommunication infrastructure, its characteristics and appearance needs to be re-modified. Ecotelligent addresses the business opportunity by introducing to the market Ecopol, the small carbon footprint telecom tower, based on the application of the science of wood construction technology. Ecopol’s environmental impact is less than half of the equivalent steel GBTs. First 30 and 40 meter high Ecopol prototypes for 3G and 4G technologies are located in Hungary. Ecotelligent’s first target market are the 51 000 GBTs needed by 2023 in the European market. The first targeted customers are operators and tower companies. Other customers are mobile network operators and other owners of passive infrastructure where mobile network devices are installed onto.    In 2023 Ecotelligent aims at selling Ecopol in 7 European countries, generating a cumulative turnover of over 27 million euros. Ecotelligent’s goal is to be the first wooden tower provider on the market offering low carbon, easy to retail alternatives and contribute to pleasant living environment. Ecotelligent’s team has long-term experience in telecommunication infrastructure design, construction and maintenance businesses, start-ups and fund-raising; extensive networks and good market knowledge.    The goal of the proposed project is to strengthen market knowledge, customer and stakeholder contacts; outline further product and service development needs and update business plan and IPR strategy.

236,198236,Yes,PEER LEARNING OF INNOVATION AGENCIES ABOUT INNOVATION SUPPORT IN SMES IN TRANSNATIONAL BUSINESS VALUE CHAINS,"This proposal offers a peer learning excercise between 3 innovation agencies from small regions in the South, the North and the Centre of Europe.  By means of the proven Twinning \ methodology they'll focus on the common challenge of the design of innovation support for SME’s operating in crossborder business value chains. In small regions, business value chains cross easily the regional borders, so SMEs have to be agile to fit these in order to grow. Stimulating business value chains is one of the policy actions of the EU Strategic Work Program.  This proposal aims to 1. learn about this sub-type of SMEs 2. investigate the current mix of instruments to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship 3. understand  the criteria of ‘value chain-fitness’  4. discuss novel approaches in the public innovation support system and make recommandations for other innovation agencies.  The mutual policy learning and exchange of ‘good practices’ will enhance the transfer of good practices in SME support which is one of the specific challenge of the work programme. Futhermore, since innovation agencies are important intermediaries  to SMEs, the peer learning will contribute to make public support for innovation in the EU more effectively.   An information “exchange” workshop with testimonials from SMEs and economic/innovation experts will give some insights in the real needs of those SMEs. Subsequently, the participants will do a small field research in their region. The information gathered will be displayed on a digital platform working as a community of practice. Finally, the participants perform the peer learning in a 2days session collaborating together in an equal relationship and discuss novel approaches in relation to the topic. In the end, a Design Options Paper documents the implementation options and guidelines that the partners in the challenge have experienced and would recommend to other innovation agencies.",1,1
674,30450,No,Wireless broadband cpn/lan for professional and residential multimedia applications,"The main objective of the project is to evaluate and implement a high speed wireless customer premises local area network (WCPN/WLAN) pilot system for multimedia applications and demonstrate it in real-user trials. The pilot system relies on a multicarrier modulation scheme which is adaptive to the transmitted data rates and channel characteristics and supports wireless ATM network extension. The system, is connected to 3rd and further generation mobile systems via the ATM interface, and utilises the 60 GHz frequency band. The technical achievements and research results which will be generated during this project, will, together with similar projects of the ACTS programme, include mobility in the present ATM network. The applicability of special coding and modulation techniques for a 60 GHz wireless LAN environment will be worked out. The 60 GHz frequency band adopted and the high speed digital processing required in the MEDIAN system will have a guiding impact on future developments of DSP and microwave technology. All project results (e.g. System specification, identification of high speed wireless multimedia applications and field trial results) are reported to standardisation bodies. Expected Impact 60 GHz technology (as upper GHz systems are needed for very high data rate broadband transmission), very fast digital signal processing and inclusion of portability in the present ATM network are the main aspects envisaged by the MEDIAN system. True wireless multimedia applications will be possible with MEDIAN-like systems.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Prototype and demonstration of a high speed wireless customer premises/local area network (WCPN/WLAN) pilot system at 60 GHz for multimedia applications. The system supports wireless ATM network extension and IP-based traffic. Contribution to the programme Identification of WCPN service requirements. The demonstrator was used for the field trials and to support standardisation work (ETSI BRAN). Technical Approach The project identifies WCPN service requirements. It investigates multi-carrier modulation schemes (OFDM), demodulation, pulse shaping, synchronisation, channel coding, time and frequency interleaving schemes, power control, medium access strategies, interworking functions with high speed data transmission (totally up to 150 Mbit/s user net) in a multipath propagation environment, connectivity aspects related to 3rd and further generation mobile systems, 60 GHz technology and VLSI technology. A pilot system demonstrator will be build which will be used for the field trials and to support standardisation work.  MEDIAN Demonstrator Summary of Trial The MEDIAN demonstrator presents the wireless extension of the ATM LAN environment which is given at the test site. The test site is composed by several SME companies in the Sligo technology park in Ireland which are all connected to the ATM network. Multimedia, voice and video applications are provided and will all be tested over the wireless MEDIAN demonstrator with up to 150 Mbit/s net user data rate. The trial is performed by the project partners in liaison with the Irish National Host.  Typical MEDIAN Scenarios Key Issues The MEDIAN concept extends the wireless means of presently existing standards, like GSM, DECT, HIPERLAN, and currently investigated future 3rd generation systems filling the gap between existing wired video applications, wireless speech and low speed data transmissions. As DECT enables wireless communication over a local area with services similar to those of the fixed PSTN, MEDIAN will expand the services of the fixed B-ISDN using local wireless broadband transmission and data interfacing to the fixed ATM network for single and multiple base stations which are sited in a local area. The OFDM scheme adopted, allows the transmission of B-ISDN originated ATM cells with one OFDM subcarrier group for maximum efficiency. The MEDIAN system envisages a transparent data flow from the fixed ATM network to the mobile ATM capable multimedia terminal. An optimised use of bandwidth is ensured by the use of an adaptive TDD access technique. Obviously QoS aspects are part of the system design.  Relative location of existing wireless communication systems and MEDIAN  Achievements The user requirement study has been concluded and the main user and application characteristics of potential wireless applications have been identified: The dynamic office environment shows the largest characteristics overlap for the largest number of applications; It has a large market potential because of the broad impact in society and the connection with social-economical trends. The system design of the MEDIAN Demonstrator is finished. The hardware design and implementation phase started. Some hardware components are already available.",0,0
27,223276,Yes,Collaborative production for the circular economy; a community approach,"POP-MACHINA aims to demonstrate the power and potential of the maker movement and collaborative production for the EU circular economy. We draw from a number of cut-edge technologies (factory-of-the-future, blockchain) and disciplines (urban planning, architecture) to provide the support necessary to overcome scaling issues; a typical drawback of collaborative production; to find the areas more in need of our intervention and to reconfigure unused spaces. We put forth an elaborate community engagement program to network, incentivize and stimulate through maker faires and events existing and new maker communities in all our municipalities. We build upon the current informal curriculum for maker skills development by nurturing the social side and we put educators and makers together to exchange ideas on the training modalities. A particular focus on the skill development of women and vulnerable groups will aim to empower these (underrepresented) segments to partake actively in collaborative production. In every pilot area we will demonstrate business oriented collaborative production of feasible and sustainable concepts from secondary raw material or other sustainable inputs, based on the needs and preferences of the local stakeholders. A thorough impact assessment framework with increased scope (e.g. social) will be co-designed with stakeholders after short basic assessment trainings and will be used in the assessment of our pilot work.

585,111352,No,Vertical TransIstors for Driving Flexible Displays,"Flexible displays based on organic light emitting diodes are seen as a key innovation in the display industry, allowing novel applications such as bendable or rollable, and thus unbreakable, displays. Rollable displays would also be suitable for roll-to-roll production, a way of dramatically reducing production costs. However, the development of flexible displays has been hampered by the lack of a suitable transistor technology that can be used to address and drive individual OLED pixels. Current technologies all either degrade under mechanical stress or have inadequate performance. Vertical organic transistors, as developed in the ERC project “NuDev”, could address this need and enable a breakthrough in flexible displays. In this project, this new transistor technology will be brought to a proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating the market and innovation potential of vertical organic transistors. To formulate a sound business plan to be presented to venture capitalists and other potential investors, all necessary market information will be gathered. In particular, a detailed comparison of the vertical transistor technology to its competitors will be carried out, necessary steps to market introduction will be detailed, an IP strategy will be developed, and potential customers in the display market will be approached. This information will help to focus the continuing technological development (funded both by NuDev and additional national and industrial funding) and to assess the commercial potential of the technology. By the end of the VIDFLEX project, a decision will have been taken as to whether to commercialize the new technology in a spin-off company or in a co-marketing activity with Novaled.",0,0
917,46876,No,"Development of an integrated, high volume manufacturing process for high value smart cards for the european population of sme moulders","Traditional manufacturing methods for transaction cards have remained largely unchanged for nearly three decades and lamination still remains the principal manufacturing process. However, the advent of the smart card has seen the emergence of injection moulded card bodies for low to medium volume applications, where greater flexibility and higher precision are required in the manufacturing process. There are more than 2000 SME injection moulders in the EU. In common with all injection moulders, involved in the supply chains to the big four European smart card system vendors ( Gemplus, Bull, GPT Axxicon and Siemens ), the Prime Proposer currently moulds card bodies for low value, contact operation smart cards, such as 'phone cards'. However, we have identified the urgent need for a new manufacturing process, based on an injection moulded card, in which the antenna, chip module, or even the die itself, is integrated with the card body and it's decoration, within the moulding process, through the use of in-mould labeling (IML). The current low volume and expensive method of manufacture for these cards is based on a sheet laminating process carried out on high capital plant by the system vendors themselves. As the 'Combi Smart Card' becomes dominant in the market, replacing the currently dominant injection moulded 'phone card' type of smart card, European SME moulders within the smart card supply chains will lose their existing business and fail to benefit from the massive market growth predicted for smart cards as a whole. The current smart card market is reported to be around 1 bn units pa, with an annual compound growth rate of between between 30% and 50%. Appendix 1 outlines the various product types and their features. Both SGS Thompson (the leading chip manufacturer) and Gemplus (the leading contact smart card manufacturer) predict the market in the year 2000 to be almost 4 billion cards pa. (Ref. 1). Siemens estimate the current value of the market to be worth $ 360m with almost 75% of smart card business to date being concentrated in Europe. By the year 2000, Siemens predicts the market to be worth $1 620m, with Europe, Asia and the USA accounting for 30% each. (Ref. 2). If an injection moulded manufacturing solution can be developed to meet the requirements of the Contactless and Combi Smart Cards as well as the existing Contact Phone Cards, the current card body moulding market of $11 5m could potentially grow by a factor of 10 as the market expands and the value added content of the output from the moulding process dramatically increases from blank card body to decorated and operational systems. However, the size, compactness and weight of product provides no barrier to protect the domestic market from imports form the other two major markets, should a non-European manufacturing solution be generated more rapidly. Bull predict that whilst the 'Combi Smart Card' accounts for around only 5% of the current market, applicational developments in telecommunication systems, banking, travel permits and digital indentity cards will create a massive trend for market demand towards the Combi Smart Card, increasing it to around 60% of the larger market, predicted for the millennium. This will result in a potential market of $1 OOOm pa for the Combi-Card. The Core group of Proposers, led by ourselves, P.d.F.I., a current supplier of card bodies to the 'contact' phone card market, also includes an IML moulder from the plastic packaging sector, as well as an IML equipment supplier, a moulding robot supplier and a conductive ink printing machine supplier. Each hoping to be involved in the manufacture of equipment and product for this rapidly expanding market. The proposed RTD is in response to the urgent industrial need to develop a European manufacturing solution for Combi Smart cardproduction, based on the injection moulding process, helping to protect existing SME moulder markets from imported cards and provide a significant opportunity for the 150 SME moulders operating in this, and related in-mould labeled ( IML ) packaging sectors.",0,0

Summary of the project  The project concentrates on key items of nuclear safety connected with a high risk potential and high consequences for the public and the ecosystem, having a strong orientation towards the enlargement related safety questions.  The different tasks within this project deal with: 1) Dissemination of the results of the experimental programs (FARO/KROTOS, LOBI) and generation of a virtual network on Nuclear Reactor Safety Research projects; 2) Investigations on the source term and the integral aspects of severe accidents together with technical and analytical support to the integral in-pile test facility PHEBUS at Cadarache, especially leading the European networks for interpretation on bundle behaviour and fission product release, circuit and containment aerosol behaviour, and chemical/radiochemical effects; 3) Development of advanced computational fluid dynamics methodologies for accident analysis, particularly for the combustion and possible explosion of hydrogen; 4) Harmonisation of safety aspects, for the advice of Commission Services on critical safety issues; 5) Safety aspects of innovative new reactor concepts.  See also the related EU enlargement process pre-accession (pa) project.  Rationale  Nuclear incidents or accidents could potentially lead to serious consequences for the plants concerned - or worse, for the public and the environment. An impact on the further security of energy supply from nuclear sources cannot be excluded with economic and competitive consequences. The enlargement of the EU, where a number of nuclear plants with different and sometimes less effective safety features enter into the EU, poses a great challenge. For these plants the key questions related to the 'defence-in-depth' concept of nuclear safety have to be compared and the integration of the Candidate Countries into a common safety level and safety culture has to be promoted. More generally a need for harmonisation of safety exist (Council resolution C128-75 and C172/2-92). International discussion increased recently on the next generation of nuclear reactors, which should have enhanced performance and safety features.",0,0
906,217976,No,Communication Using the Nonlinear Fourier Transform,"High-speed optical fiber networks form the backbone of the information and communication technologies, including the Internet. More than 99% of the Internet data traffic is carried by a network of global optical fibers. Despite their great importance, today's optical fiber networks face a looming capacity crunch: The achievable rates of all current technologies characteristically vanish at high input powers due to distortions that arise from fiber nonlinearity. The solution of this long-standing complex problem has become the holy grail of the field of the optical communication.  The aim of this project is to develop a novel foundation for optical fiber communication based on the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT). The NFT decorrelates signal degrees-of-freedom in optical fiber, in much the same way that the conventional Fourier transform does for linear systems. My collaborators and I have recently proposed nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) based on the NFT, in which the information is encoded in the generalized frequencies and their spectral amplitudes (similar to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing). Since distortions such as inter-symbol and inter-channel interference are absent in NFDM, it achieves data rates higher than conventional methods. The objective of this proposal is to advance NFDM to the extent that it can be built in practical large-scale systems, thereby overcoming the limitation that fiber nonlinearity sets on the transmission rate of the communication networks. The proposed research relies on novel methodology and spans all aspects of the NFDM system design, including determining the fundamental information-theoretic limits, design of the NFDM transmitter and receiver, algorithms and implementations.   The feasibility of the project is manifest in preliminary proof-of-concepts in small examples and toy models, PI's leadership and track-record in the field, as well as the ideal research environment.",0,0

287,38538,No,"Role of thrombin in cardiovascular diseases. Interactions with receptors, substrates and inhibitors","The project seeks to understand the molecular events involved in the recognition by thrombin of various cell membrane and plasma proteins. The project is focused on thrombin functions that are highly susceptible to contribute to thrombosis and associated disorders : (i) receptor-mediated cell activation, (ii) feed-back amplification of thrombin production by activation of factor V and factor VIII, (iii) thrombin inactivation by its physiological inhibitor, antithrombin.  The final enzyme of the coagulation cascade, thrombin, plays a key role in the development of arterial thrombosis, associated inflammation and atherosclerosis. Thrombin is a multifunctional enzyme which induces both the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and cell activation, and also regulates its own production, by interacting with a number of cell membrane and plasma proteins. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the human enzyme in complex with various specific inhibitors has been elucidated, revealing that thrombin's structure can be divided in several functional regions that recognize different chemical moieties of other molecules. The remarkable specificity of thrombin for its various natural substrates, ligands and inhibitors may be ascribed to multiple interactions with the different functional regions (active site and exosites) of the enzyme, but the detailed mechanisms of these interactions remain to be resolved.  The aim of the collaborative study is to identify the particular residues of thrombin that are important for its interaction with the receptor, factor V, factor VIII and antithrombin. Five teams of researchers will contribute with their extensive previous experience in the field of thrombin research and will combine their efforts by providing a wide variety of unique methodology, from site-directed mutagenesis, through rapid-kinetics, to X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It is hoped that the information provided by the project will be most helpful in devising new strategies for inhibition of specified thrombin functions and improvement of the prevention of arterial thrombosis.",0,0
214,189104,Yes,Network Functions as-a-Service over Virtualised Infrastructures,"Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) is an emerging concept, which refers to the migration of certain network functionalities, traditionally performed by hardware elements, to virtualized IT infrastructures, where they are deployed as software components. NFV leverages commodity servers and storage, including cloud platforms, to enable rapid deployment, reconfiguration and elastic scaling of network functionalities.With the aim of promoting the NFV concept, T-NOVA introduces a novel enabling framework, allowing operators not only to deploy virtualized Network Functions (NFs) for their own needs, but also to offer them to their customers, as value-added services. Virtual network appliances (gateways, proxies, firewalls, transcoders, analyzers etc.) can be provided on-demand as-a-Service, eliminating the need to acquire, install and maintain specialized hardware at customers' premises. For these purposes, T-NOVA will design and implement a management/orchestration platform for the automated provision, configuration, monitoring and optimization of Network Functions-as-a-Service (NFaaS) over virtualised Network/IT infrastructures. T-NOVA leverages and enhances cloud management architectures for the elastic provision and (re-) allocation of IT resources assigned to the hosting of Network Functions. It also exploits and extends Software Defined Networking platforms for efficient management of the network infrastructure.Furthermore, in order to facilitate the involvement of diverse actors in the NFV scene and attract new market entrants, T-NOVA establishes a 'NFV Marketplace', in which network services and Functions by several developers can be published and brokered/traded. Via the Marketplace, customers can browse and select the services and virtual appliances which best match their needs, as well as negotiate the associated SLAs and be charged under various billing models. A novel business case for NFV is thus introduced and promoted.",0,1
134,223543,Yes,Eco-innovative building products for sustainable construction,"As the EU pushes forward to significantly reduce both its energy consumption and carbon footprint, green construction has become a top priority.

105,207973,Yes,New Method of Magnetic Field Integration and its Smart Grid and Industrial Applications,"Due to massive growth in the use of electric equipment and worldwide increase of the electrical distribution/consumption, the interest in sensors for electrical current measurement, particularly in high voltage levels, has increased significantly over the last decade. Intensive research is carried out in this field. The result is the method based on magneto-optical effect requiring special optical fibers and optical instrumentation. Due to special technologies the sensor is too expensive for most of the industrial applications. Applied Precision is a Slovak innovative company established in 1992 and belongs to the world top three companies in test and calibration systems for electricity meters. The company has developed and patented new breakthrough measuring method based on magnetic field integration with magnetic fiber. The method is not only comparable with the magneto-optical method in high currents applications but significantly more sensitive for low current applications at fractional price level.  The most important user benefits are: full integration in smart distributed systems with independent communication, highest accuracy up to 0.1%, simple installation, low operational costs, high interoperability and mechanical flexibility, broad field of applications and very affordable price (less than 20% of  optical solutions). Dramatically lower price of measurement devices, easy and flexible integration in existing or newly designed network measuring and control systems have a unique perspective to bring disruptively new way of their implementation with enormous benefit for monitor the efficiency of energy networks, devices and single participants with positive impact on investments and operational costs and environmental impact.

560,196336,No,Fast Data Acquisition and Servo Technologies,"Fast data acquisition devices and servo technologies are essential in multiple processes that require a fast response to a sensor input. They are present in multiple automatic procedures for the accurate functioning of trains, planes, and robotic systems either for domestic or industrial activities. As a result of the research performed in the SM-DNA-Repair project (ERC-206117), we have developed a fully digital acquisition board superior in most specifications to current technology because it combines, in a single board, high speed, high channels count, easy integration and development, and is cost effective. The new board has already been validated in a relevant Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) environment (TRL5, Technology Readiness Level 5), being able to reproduce results obtained with analogue devices. Now, I aim to turn the output of the SM-DNA-Repair project into a commercial proposition by exploring the commercial potential of the device and by eventually attract capital for its further development.  The ServoTec Proof of Concept project aims are three-fold. First, to perform a market feasibility study of the fast digital servo board developed, in order to exploit the technology integrated into AFM commercial systems for high-speed applications. Second, to make commercially available the technology and to explore other added-value services for wide range applications and customised solutions. Third, to establish the IP position strategy, including the possibility to license the technology to a company that already commercialises data acquisition boards for the general market. These three commercialisation formats will address a global market. Exploratory work regarding competitive analysis, IPR position and strategy and contacts with the industrial sector has been already initiated. The commercial exploitation route, to be defined along the project, will be either through a spin-off or SME, through patent license or agreement for technology exploitation.",0,0
