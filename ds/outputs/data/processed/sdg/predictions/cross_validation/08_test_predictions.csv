959,14467,No,ATMOSPHERIC,"The main objective of the ATMOSPHERIC project is to identify network configurations and solutions which will accommodate the uncertain service growth and mix during a network transition towards full ATM based IBC. Verification and evaluation of recommended solutions will be supported through the construction of a model to assess technology performance requirements, the flexibility / compatibility of network architectural concepts and design options, and the economic viability of ATMOSPHERIC's solutions for upgrading the local distribution network to provide IBC.  The main objective of the ATMOSPHERIC project is to identify network configurations and solutions which will accommodate the uncertain service growth and mix during a network transition towards full asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) based integrated broadband technology (IBC). Verification and evaluation of recommended solutions will be supported through the construction of a model to assess technology performance requirements, the flexibility/compatibility of network architectural concepts and design options, and the economic viability of ATMOSPHERIC's solutions for upgrading the local distribution network to provide IBC. Market predictions for the transition phase leading to a mature broadband network have been issued. For the network, novel features and concepts have been promoted, including: the flexible architecture and building-block (BB) concept, definitions of a set of reusable generic key elements (GKE) and key components (KC), completion of designs of demonstrator versions of these building blocks and the extended stratified reference model (ERM), which proposes a new way of using the lower three layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) reference model. A demonstrator configuration has been defined from selected network capabilities and services, required during the transitional period. ATMOSPHERIC has contributed to standardisation and common functional specification (CFS). It has constructed building blocks using appropriate technologies and high technology components, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). Technical Approach    The principal areas of study within the project are network functionality, network configuration, and technology.  The first two aspects are derived from service and network evolution considerations.  Techniques for network resource allocation and management have been studied as inputs to building block specification.    Implementation technology has been evaluated in three stages: Identification of the key technologies available in the late 1990s; selection of currently available technologies for demonstrator implementation; and identification of key industry-standard components for use in IBC networks.    Key Issues    - Interworking with existing public networks and supporting access from existing terminals and subscriber premises networks.   - Development of a flexible and economic network and system architecture allowing reuse of existing network resources.   - Validation in a demonstrator of the proposed solutions and recommendations.    Achievements    Market predictions for the transition phase leading to a mature broadband network have been issued.  For the network, novel features and concepts have been promoted, including:   - the flexible architecture and building-block (BB) concept   - definitions of a set of reusable generic key elements (GKE) and key components (KC)   - completion of designs of demonstrator versions of these building blocks   - the extended stratified reference model (ERM), which proposes a new way of using the lower three layers of the OSI reference model.    A demonstrator configuration has been defined from selected network capabilities and services, required during the transitional period.    ATMOSPHERIC has contributed to the work of all three Parts of RACE I, ie: contributions to standardisation and CFS; it has constructed building blocks using appropriate technologies and high-tech components (ASICs); and contributed to the BIPED and BUNI demonstrators.    Expected Impact    ATMOSPHERIC is uniquely positioned to provide inputs to actors within the telecoms sector, on the 'hybrid solutions' required during a network transition towards full ATM operation.  These inputs cover the relevance of new transmission standards and switching techniques, and how these may interwork within hybrid networks. ATMOSPHERIC can explain the means by which existing terminals and services may continue to be supported, and the benefits provided by an open architecture.",0,0
308,69077,Yes,Modelling opportunities and limits for restructuring europe towards sustainability,"The project framework of MOSUS is set by key agreements for the future sustainable development of the European Union. MOSUS will apply an integrated ecological-economic simulation model to quantify the interrelations between socio-economic driving forces and the state of the environment. The analysis uses a multi-country, multi-sectoral macroeconomic framework, including trade flows within Europe and between Europe and all otherworld regions. The model will be the first such tool to directly integrate comprehensive biophysical data (materials, energy, land use data, and greenhouse gas emissions) in simulations to the year 2020, putting them in relation to indicators of social and economic development.

386,200532,No,"Linking genetic resources, genomes and phenotypes of Solanaceous crops","G2P-SOL is a research alliance bringing together the major European and International repositories of germplasm with public and private institutions active in genomics, phenotyping and breeding in the four major Solanaceous crops: potato, tomato, pepper and eggplant. These four crops constitute 66% of the value of European horticultural production, and over 65,000 accessions are available within the consortium. By harnessing the available global biodiversity, novel genotyping and phenotyping concepts and data analysis tools, the G2P-SOL project will link the genetic code underlying Solanaceae biodiversity with the traits that improve productivity, adaptation and human health. By making this information accessible to end-users, the awareness of the available diversity will be increased and use of this genetic diversity in breeding programs will be stimulated, resulting in diversified production chains. The phenotypes and traits of material held in European and major international collections will be described using common ontology terms developed in this project and this information will be housed in an open source software platform, allowing easy interfacing with existing platforms for germplasm cataloguing. G2P-SOL will develop shared values in science and education in the following areas: 1) Defining and maintaining genetic pools for crop improvement. 2) Phenomic and genomic data: generation, analysis, storage, and linkage with gene banks. 3) Pre-breeding and germplasm enhancement. 4) Training, workshops and public outreach. G2P-SOL will redefine how to manage and organize genetic resources and linked genomic and phenomic information in a manner that will make them accessible to naturalists, geneticists and breeders for conservation, scientific research, and breeding in the post genomic era, in compliance with the objectives of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources and the Nagoya Protocol.",0,0
833,74270,No,MOBILISING THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL RESEARCH POTENTIAL IN SUPPORT OF BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT,"Counteracting the decline of biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable management of ecosystems requires insight into the socio-economic processes and structures, which directly or indirectly impact on them. However, there is a discrepancy in the amount of research work carried out in the economic domain, and the amount of work done in the more strictly social domain. The more purely social dimension of protection of biodiversity and ecosystems is still somewhat under explored, and it would be premature to talk about a well-established European field of social research on biodiversity and ecosystem management, or of a coordinated international research programme. Still, the work that has been done indicates that sociological knowledge and research methodologies can be successfully applied to issues concerning ecosystem and biodiversity management. Despite this obvious potential to support and enhance the effectiveness of ecosystem and biodiversity management, social research is not yet commonly integrated in the development and implementation of biodiversity policy. Many biodiversity policy makers have educational and professional backgrounds in the life sciences, appear unfamiliar or ill at ease with theoretical concepts and methodologies of the social sciences and are unsure how and where to involve social research. Furthermore, there is room for advancement in the translation of insights concerning the societal context of ecosystem and biodiversity management into policy tools, such as models. Involving leading researchers from Germany, Hungary, Norway, Spain, Romania, the Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom, the overall aim of So Bio is to stimulate relevant social research contributing tithe management of biodiversity and ecosystems, and especially to the development of successful policies in this field. This will be achieved by providing an overview, assessing policy, identifying priority needs and stimulating new relevant research.",0,0
245,44539,Yes,Growth and unemployment,"Research objectives and content  The main research objective is explore some links between unemployment and growth. Different ways will be followed. First of all, we will build a creative destruction model. By creative destruction we refer to the Schumpeterian view that associates economic growth and technical progress with a continuous structural change involving the 'death' of some productive activities (with the resulting destroyed jobs) and their replacement by more efficient activities (with the resulting created jobs). We will use a vintage capital growth model with complementariness of labor and capital. We will try explicitly to solve for the dynamics of job creation and destruction in sharp contrast to the existing literature on the same topic. We will show that convergence to the steady state growth path is oscillatory, due to endogenous replacement echoes. Hence, the model will allow to analyze the cyclical properties of job creation and destruction where the sole fluctuation source is endogenous. We will shed ligth on the economic mechanism at work in this kind of economies. In particular, we will show that the cyclical properties of job creation and destruction depend strongly on the initial distribution of jobs in the economy. Second of all, we will analyze the relationship between growth, unemployment and demand composition, and we will study fiscal policy effects on unemployment and growth. We will use a standard overlapping generation framework modified to incorporate matching frictions in the labor market, a technology capable of yielding unbounded endogenous growth and monopolistic competition with free entry and exit. In our model markup will be endogenous and it will depend on demand composition. Therefore, changes in propensity to save affect not only growth, but also employment. This relationship will be studied. Finally, we will build a model of heterogenous micromarkets. Markups and utilization of factors will differ across markets. Implications of this heterogenousness on subutilization of factors and markups will be studied. We think that aperiodic fluctuations in markups, utilization of factors, number of firms and output could rise in this economy.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The CEPREMAP is involved in theoretical and applied research on macroeconomic theory, being one of the top european institution in economic research.

809,101309,No,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY POLICY COORDINATION AND DISTRESS CONTAGION,"The proposed research involves two lines of investigation. The first line is dedicated to the study the role of monetary policy in explaining international stock market correlations. It also contributes to our understanding of the international propagation of shocks. As highlighted by the recent financial crisis, understanding how monetary policy affects financial markets is crucial for the conduct of monetary policy. Central Banks are usually among the first policy makers to react to business cycle fluctuations,and to crisis and economic shocks. But they do not react in the same way. Central Banks have different objectives and beliefs that make them heterogeneous. The goal of this project is to focus on how the time varying nature of Central Bank policy coordination is reflected in stock markets.  The second line of enquiry studies the cross-sectional asset-pricing implications of the technological connectivity among sectors/firms’ output, when the latter is subject to persistent distress events. We pursue this task in an equilibrium pure-exchange model, where incomplete information and learning account for imprecise knowledge of market fundamentals and play an important role in the crosssectional comovement of assets prices. Barro (2009) argues that the desire to hedge against chances of macroeconomic disasters is worth a significant portion of the GDP while the welfare cost from usual economic fluctuations is much smaller and hardly able to explain the properties of expected returns. The researer will develop a model of an economy with multiple assets in positive net supply (orchard) where the economy-wise propagation of firms‘/sectors‘ cycles of distress and recovery gives rise not only to the observed time-variation of correlations, and to empirically sound predictions for both the equity premium and the interest rate puzzles, but also to the cross-section of expected returns.",1,0
88,227198,Yes,BENE Innovation Internationalisation services 2020-2021,"The project aims at offering specific innovation services to 2 different groups of SMEs based in the Brussels Capital Region: - the SMEs beneficiaries of the H2020 European Innovation Council (EIC) Pilot and its funding schemes on the one side, and - the SMEs having a high potential for growth and internationalisation by the enhancement of their innovation management capacity on the other side. These services will be an integral part of the Enterprise Europe Brussels services and will be provided in the frame of a sounded client's journey approach, in line with the company's life cycle.  Although for the beneficiaries of the H2020 Enhanced European Innovation Council Pilot funding schemes the proposer depends on the number of successful SME granted and notified by EASME, a funnel approach will be adopted for both groups of SMEs in order to have an upstream estimation and selection of the SME potential existing in the region.  This funnel and selective approach will also take into consideration the permeable frontiers which divide one SME group from the other, in the light of the innovation needs and capacities existing at a given time of the SME lifecycle.  The service provision for Group 2 will be ensured via a structure process, relying on a contest approach, SME pre-selection, set-up according to a predefined methodology, which relies on ad-hoc tools (and based on 9 criteria) and methodologies, designed with the aim to select only those SMEs with capacity, clear intent and ambition to benefit from the innovation management assessment.  In function of the score obtained in the different criteria, the SME will be selected (or not) to benefit from the innovation management capacity assessment held with one of two retained tools, both complaint to EU standard CEN/TS 16555-1 “Innovation management system”.

711,57858,No,Air Pollution Network for Early warning and on-line information exchange in Europe,"APNEE's objective is to establish services for human centred management of cities by building a geographic information portal for urban air quality. APNEE will serve citizens as well as professionals, European Authorities (Local and Regional) and relevant European institutes. This portal will provide online visualisation means about real-time air pollution, and special features like discussion boards, online newsletters and early warning systems. Dissemination of information will be based on highly sophisticated technology standards like WAP, GSM, SMS, WEB and GIS. The Project will serve requirements specified in EU-directives relating to citizen information on health threatening air pollutants. APNEE provides an interface to air pollution management systems and facilitates dissemination of appropriate information to affected groups of citizens. The prime focus is on air pollution management, rather than air pollution measurement, forecasting or alert systems. Once APNEE is in place, there will be a dedicated information service to inform citizens on the potential impacts of their behaviour. Rather than broadcasting alarms on air quality (through news media), APNEE aims to increase citizen's ongoing knowledge of air quality and how their behaviour can influence it.  Objectives: The APNEE project aims to increase the knowledge of citizens on air quality and develop the exchange of information both on a local level in European cities and at normal & regional levels among European institutions. Dissemination of quality information will take place by implementing new communication lines such as mobile telephone functionality, multimedia, electronic panels and the Internet. The APNEE project will integrate new information technologies as additional management modules in existing Air Quality Management Systems in European cities.  Prime objectives are to: implement an interface to available information on air pollution and design a harmonised classification methodology; implement user-friendly information services for citizens, public and private organisations, and business communities; develop the exchange of information among professionals, local and regional authorities across Europe, and relevant European institutions; introduce and facilitate forecasting of pollution and data modelling. APNEE services aim to become the reference portal for topical and real time environmental air quality information.   Milestones: User requirements (UR) inventory concerning air pollution warning and information; Generalised UR methodology analysis for use in all interested EU countries; Exhaustive 'shopping' basket for APNEE related technologies Detailed market analysis for horizontal and vertical markets; Detailed technical and functional specifications for online air pollution and warning systems; General approach for building intuitive interfaces on large amounts of data; Operational air pollution warning and information system; Detailed evaluation report; Overall dissemination and use plan.",0,0

Summary of the project  The project provides support on transport policy related issues, mainly through a prospective techno-economic analysis of transport-related developments and trends. An integrated approach that considers the social, environmental and economic aspects of transport technology is applied.  The studies of the project are implemented along two main working lines: i) Analysis of new/emerging transport technologies: Foresight studies focusing on technologies that may lead to major environmental and efficiency improvements (e.g. alternative propulsion systems such as hybrid, electric, fuel cell and hydrogen). Studies on the impacts of information/ communication technologies (e.g. intelligent transport systems), e-commerce, logistics and organisational improvements. Identification of success factors or barriers for the introduction of new technologies. Investigation of policy measures to accelerate the market uptake of new technologies; ii) Investigation of socio-economic aspects of transport: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the driving factors that stimulate the developments in transport and mobility. Scenarios and models to investigate long-term trends. Assessment of the interactions of transport with societal needs, economic activity and the environment. Indicators for the assessment and evaluation of transport policies.  As a complement to the above activities, the project develops or adapts qualitative methods, as well as quantitative tools and models that can be applied in similar activities addressing different sectors. In particular, these are applied in studies related to the investigation of the impacts of the enlargement of the EU on sustainability, environment and natural resources (by combining issues relevant to transport, energy, industry and agriculture), as well as in studies investigating the impacts of new technologies on employment (by applying the macro- and regional economic modules initially developed for the strategic transport models).  Rationale  Transport is indispensable to satisfy basic social needs of mobility and accessibility, and is an important factor for European competitiveness. On the other hand, transport benefits are increasingly accompanied by major side effects, namely traffic congestion, air pollution, resources depletion and safety. Transport issues are particularly pressing since the need to foster economic development and the pressure to minimise transport externalities are difficult to reconcile. In addition, a number of trends such as the restructuring of industrial activities, the EU enlargement process and the application of emerging information and communication technologies, will produce significant impacts on the transport intensity of companies and will reshape the characteristics of transport demand in terms of quality and quantity. There is a need to improve the understanding of the connection between transport intensity and economic growth and to devise strategies to optimise the investment in transport without affecting the economic performance, the current social benefits and the environment. The analysis of such complex issues involved in the transport system requires an interdisciplinary and integrated perspective, which takes into account technological innovations as well as organisational and socio-economic aspects.",0,0
434,6036,No,Development and adaptation of rapid molecular screening technics for assessing genetic diversity in forest trees,"The project aimed at the development and adaptation of rapid molecular technics for identification and genetic analysis of DNA polymorphism in forest trees. In line with the objectives of the generic project (Coordination A. Karp) 'Technology Development' and 'Strategy Development', methods had to be adapted and optimized for rapid and reliable extraction of DNA from different sources (nuclear, extra-nuclear) and tissues such as leaves or needles, buds, seeds, and single pollen grains. Molecular screening technics had to be developed or adapted and optimized for rapid and large-scale application. Basic technics were PCR-based technics, RFLP, non-radioactive methods, TGGE, SSCP and sequencing. Image and data processing routines were to be developed. The project focused on leading tree species in European forest ecosystems, representing gymnosperm and angiosperm species. Development and adaptation of molecular screening technics were supposed to broaden the scientific base for EC regulations concerning declaration and conservation of genetic resources and trade with reproductive material.   TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT:  DNA EXTRACTION Extraction procedures were adapted to the difficult forest tree species. In addition, they were scaled down and/or sped up. Thus, optimized protocols are available for leaves or needles, buds and seeds. For special applications, extraction procedures were developed for chloroplast DNA and single pollen grains. As a result of a practical workshop, a new industrial protocol was developed which was proved to be successful with woody species difficult in DNA extraction. This DNA mini-preparation combines acidic lysis with silica-gel membrane technology and allows DNA isolation for many samples in only one hour.  OPTIMIZATION OF PCR-BASED TECHNOLOGIES For purpose of rapid and large-scale molecular screening, PCR-based technology was evaluated key-technology. Apart from random DNA amplification (RAPD), PCR application has become routine which enables specific amplification of different polymorphic samples of the genome (nuclear repetitive DNA, nuclear exons and introns, chloroplast SSRs, and organelle genes and intergenic spacers. Primer design was performed after precedent characterization of the specific loci or was based on available sequences from international data bases (for information on loci and primers, see UNIVERSAL TOOLS). PCR approach was successful for random amplification of DNA from single pollen grains of European beech and for specific amplification of chloroplast DNA from single pollen grains of Abies species. For exploring polymorphism of DNA fragments or subsets of the genome, PCR-supported technologies were successfully adapted: SSCP-technic has successfully been adapted to long PCR fragments in oak and spruce. TGGE-technic was adapted and down-scaled to rapid Mini-TGGE. Cycle sequencing technic has become a routine in many labs of the project. SCAR and ISTR - technic are in use with forest tree species. AFLP technic has been adapted to the large genome of Norway spruce. PCR-based screening of genomic libraries has been set up. A procedure for visualizing specific PCR products without electrophoresis has been patented.  DATA SCORING AND ANALYSES Image processing is in use as a basic requirement for subsequent managing and analyzing DNA electro-pherogrammes. A computer programme (CoTrix 2.0) has been developed for digitizing DNA banding patterns and performing segregation/linkage analysis in haploid or diploid progeny of a mother plant or of the two parental plants respectively. Additionally, it assesses genetic distances. Computer software packages (DDAT, DNAL, MAPRF) have been developed for molecular data management, linkage mapping and QTL analysis which consider all possible allelic configurations. Interfaces have been developed for transfer of data to other programmes. Reconstruction of population dynamics has been based on a novel stepwise mutation model for SSR loci.  NON-RADIOACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND AUTOMATION DIG-Oxigenin (resp. Biotin) labelling and detection kits have been sucessfully applied on DNA/RNA probing in forest tree species. An increase of efficiency was achieved for searching repetitive motives in genomic libraries of Norway spruce by precedent enrichment of the library (patented procedure). PCR screening of clones replaces laborious traditional screening of libraries. Semi-automated SSR-genotyping of individuals was performed by using an automated sequencing apparatus.  UNIVERSAL TOOLS In line with the appreciation of PCR as key-technology, primer design was pushed in number and with regard to amplification of different samples of the genome: Primer sequences have been designed for universal use in a broad range of species. A total of 28 pairs of primers for amplifying polymorphic regions in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA are available after alignment from DNA data bases. Primers for amplifying microsatellite loci (SSRs) in nuclear and chloroplast genome have been designed after precedent sequence-characterizing the respective loci. For oak (Quercus robur/petraea), 18 microsatellite loci in nuclear genome have been sequence-characterized, for Norway spruce (Picea abies) there are about 120. In chloroplast genome of Pinus leucodermis 20 SSRs have been identified and sequence-characterized. The microsatellite primer pairs are currently being tested on universal applicability in the respective genera and families (Quercus, Pinus, Picea, Fagaceae, Pinaceae). Minisatellite DNA regions and fingerprint-like elements have been detected and characterized in Quercus spec. and Picea abies. Within particular genes of Picea abies, intron variability has been studied. A genomic library and cDNA library have been established for Picea abies; a genetic linkage map for the same species was constructed using AFLPs and SSRs. In Pinus radiata linkage mapping is performed on the basis of RAPDs, ISTRs and RFPLs. In oak, a few microsatellite loci were mapped on a genetic map of Qu. robur.  STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT  ASSESSING LEVELS OF DIVERSITY IN NATURAL POPULATIONS Assessment and quantification of genetic diversity in natural forest tree populations need validation of the molecular tools with respect to the demands of the end users. For most applications the tools have to fulfill population genetic demands. Basic requirements are inheritance analysis and determination of mode of gene action. Inheritance analysis of extra-nuclear DNA: Uniparentally maternal inheritance of cp and mt DNA was confirmed for oak and mt DNA of Norway spruce. Uniparentally paternal inheritance of cpDNA was confirmed for fir (Abies). Strategies and technics leading to nuclear DNA codominant markers: By means of segregation analysis in haploid/diploid progeny, modes of inheritance and gene action were be determined. A computer-programme has been developed to particularly analyze multiband patterns for alleles with codominant/dominant mode of gene action (CoTrix). SSCP technic was proved to be suited to transform PCR nuclear fragments into codominant markers. =>By means of inheritance analysis, Mendelian inheritance and codominant gene action was confirmed for 5 microsatellite loci of oak and 7 Norway spruce microsatellite loci (current state of art, inheritance analysis is ongoing for additional loci). In a haploid progeny of Norway spruce, an average of 10 bands from an AFLP multiband pattern were observed to segregate in an 1:1 ratio. PCR-SSCP fragments were confirmed to follow Mendelian inheritance and a general allelic description was given to SSCP electrophoretic profiles. Comparative approach to genetic structures of populations by use of different DNA and traditional isozyme gene markers To learn about the potential of the different markers, comprehensive comparative studies have been started in populations of beech (Fagus sylvatica) as well as in populations of oak (Qu. robur, Qu. petraea). Mediterranean oaks have been investigated by comparative analyses of chloroplast DNA using RFLPs as opposed to PCR-RFLPs. In Picea abies, Pinus halepensis, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus radiata populations genotyping is done by different DNA markers and partially compared to results from isozyme gene investigations. Approach to differentiate between the two oak species Qu. robur and Qu. petraea by using different markers.  TESTING THE TOOLS AGAINST EXISTING CLASSIFICATIONS A total of 62 woody species broad ranged in angiosperms and gymnosperms were studied for variation in chloroplast psbC gene region by means of PCR-RFLP. Relationships with existing systematics were found and discussed.  DETECTION OF 'USEFUL VARIATION' In Norway spruce (Picea abies), 6 different mRNAs were identified which were proved to be ozon-inducible under controlled fumigation. In Pinus radiata one promising RAPD marker has been found to be co-segregating with growth characteristics, two ISTR fragments with cold resistance. In Norway spruce, it was suggested that mutations or modifications of the CADH open reading frame are correlated with the susceptability to Armillaria infections.  MAIN JOINT EFFORTS 1.

215,108488,Yes,Labour trajectories in UK and Spain. Analysis of capabilities in transitions using a mixed-method approach,"'European labour markets are undergoing profound changes. Although the mode and extent varies between Member States according to national labour market regulations, there is a general trend towards non-standard forms of employment within the EU. The emergence of non-standard forms of employment is linked to a growing polarisation of wages and income and an expanding low-wage sector in many European countries. Theses tendencies have even been further increased by the effects of economic recession. The project aims to define and characterise trajectories before and after the economic recession of 2007 in Spain and UK. Then the project will investigate transitions between employment situations (with or without unemployment spells) as 'potential turning points' that allow identification of the effective capacity for action by the individual and how employment and company policies increase or decrease the real set of options available to the individual. By means of a mixed-method approach that combine quantitative analyisis of trajectories and narrative biographies the main objectives of this proposal are to: - Identify quantitative trajectories based in transitions in UK and Spain. The analysis before and after 'economic recession' will allow social and employment profiles to be defined in the two periods and identify main collectives in which economic recession has been a turning point in trajectories. - Analyze in both countries narrative biographies of workers with the social and employment profiles identified in quantitative trajectories to identify the role played by institutional, company and personal resources and conversion factors to increase or not capabilities in transitions. - Identify the main inequality axis regarding the real options for personal and professional path development according to personal objectives in a context of increasing discontinuities.'",1,1
796,48118,No,The significance of economic incentives in fisheries management under the CFP.,"The project will examine the implementation at the national level of those key policy components of the CFP, which are intended to control fishing effort and fishing mortality. The focus of the project will therefore be on the measures adopted by different Member States in order to fulfil their obligations under the basic conservation and management regulation relating to the observance of national catch quotas and to achieve the reductions in fleet capacity agreed under the MAGPs  The focus is put on the subsequent types of management:  1. Quota management systems (output regulation) 2. Effort management systems (input regulation) 3. Fleet capacity adjustment   Economic Incentives, definition  Economic incentives can be used by managing authorities (principals) to induce particular responses or behaviours from investors or actors (agents) in the fishing industry, either by reducing profits (in the case of negative incentives) or by increasing profits (in the case of positive incentives). When trying to determine the minimum value of the premium which should be paid from the principal (managers) to the agent (fisherman) to switch from one target species to the other, for example, fisheries managers are faced with an optimisation problem with a number of economic constraints. Problems like this can be handled using available software (such as GAMS used by several project partners).   Quantification  Economic incentives materialised in the shadow value of circumventing or violating specific management stipulations will be quantified wherever possible. This will happen along the lines explained in the above optimisation problem, once we have identified where, when and how economic incentives are implemented through existing management schemes. Hereafter, quantification could take various forms which will have to be determined after the objectives of the CFP on Member State level and the economic incentive types have been identified. Without laying down any precise approach and methodology, a number of aims are listed: Effort management: In the investigation of effort regulation the limitation of number of vessels and fishing days with respect to certain quota limitation would lead to a larger profit of a given species. This profit will be calculated in an optimisation model used in the sub-project. The profit will lead to a reallocation of effort by the fisherman towards this species. Should managers want to prevent fishermen from targeting this species, the necessary compensatory payment would be calculated as equal to the profit (marginal) from fishing this species. The method used is to construct a model that optimise the profit of a vessel/or group of vessels subject to a number of constraints (linear/non linear programming). The optimisation produces marginal profits which are the shadow value of having the constraints relaxed e.g. have an extra fishing day or an extra tonne of fish.  Capacity adjustment: A different type of quantification is the premium that is paid for decommissioning (capacity adjustment). Here the economic incentive is laid down in advance by the managers, and the sub-project would investigate the premium structure and the size of payment and relate this to the numbers of vessels, GRT and horsepower withdrawn. The premium is the economic incentive to persuade fishermen to choose decommissioning rather than to keep on fishing.  Quota management: A third type of quantification is associated with individual transferable quotas. The price of the quota is an estimate of the premium that has to be paid to fishers to, say, reduce the catches of a particular species. If a quota market exists, managers could use the price of a quota as an indication of the magnitude of the economic incentive a fisherman needs to go on fishing, and consequently what is needed to prevent him from fishing. Where no legal quota trading exist, quantification may be difficult. Nevertheless, the capital that is accrued in these rights is an estimate of the magnitude of an economic incentive and it would be important to identify where and how the capital is accrued in the absence of a market. In principle the same method as the one used in effort regulation could be applied in an attempt to estimate the value of quota rights.  General objective  The objective of the project is to investigate the role and significance of economic incentives in the management of European fisheries, within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Specific objectives  - To identify the role and significance of economic incentives in the management of European fisheries in the context of the CFP; in particular to examine how the behaviour of fishing firms in response to national policy measures have aided or hindered the achievement of management objectives;   - to produce a set of guidelines for policy makers suggesting how the design of fishery management measures could be improved by taking economic incentives into account.  The study approach  Case studies are selected in the five Member States participating in the project:  Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.   The configuration of the case-studies will be as follows:  - quota management systems will be studied in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark; - effort management systems will be studied in Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands; - capacity adjustment programmes will be studied in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.  At the start of the project a general methodological framework will be developed by the co-ordinator in order to provide the conceptual foundation for the study.  The overall analysis of the role and significance of economic incentives in fisheries management will be approached from the perspective of the economic theory of agency. This characterises the contractual relationships between individuals in the economy in terms of a principal and one or more agents. The principal (in this case the fishery management authority) seeks to ensure that the aggregate of the choices of all the individual decision-making agents (fishing firms) is in the interest of the principal. However, the (private) interests of the individual agents may not be the same as the (public) interests of the principal. If perfect enforcement of desired behaviour on the part of all agents is not feasible, the principal must try to establish an incentive scheme that will align the interests of the agents with those of the principal. Where this is not achieved there is an incentive alignment problem that will tend to produce a sub-optimal outcome (at least from the principal's point of view). This conceptual approach has been applied to a variety of situations, including problems of environmental quality and the modelling of international fisheries relations.  The methodological framework will also outline the context for the study through a summary of the relevant areas of the CFP and an identification of the policy limits within which national management measures have been implemented.  Against the background of this conceptual and contextual framework, the specific methodology for each of the case-studies will then be developed jointly by the relevant groups of participants. Each specific case-study methodology will be adapted to the particular type of management measure under consideration, the precise details of national policies in this area and the nature of the requisite datasets identified.   However, the basic questions that each of the studies will seek to answer at the national level may be summarised as follows:  - How was the national management system designed and implemented? - What were the general and detailed objectives in terms of Community obligations and national priorities? - What were the results in terms of the stated objectives, and what other results were apparent that might be of interest to policy-makers? - What were the economic incentives, affecting the behaviour of fishing firms in response to the management measures, that impacted on the results observed?  In order to identify the appearance, operation and consequences of economic incentives in each of the national studies, both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be employed, depending on the particular management objectives involved and the extent of data availability at the national level.  A comparative analysis of the results of the national studies will be undertaken within the appropriate groups of participants in order to produce the results of the case-studies on different types of management measure.  During the final phase of the project a synthetic treatment of the results of the case-studies will be undertaken by the co-ordinator. A key issue to be explored here will be the interaction between different types of management measure and the overall objectives of the CFP. The overall results will be interpreted and discussed against the background of the literature on the economics of fisheries management. Finally, the conclusions of the project will be presented in the form of a set of clear guidelines on how the design of fishery management measures could be improved by taking economic incentives fully into account.",1,0
53,198245,Yes,Innovation services and key account management support for Basque SMEs during 2015-2016,"Across the EU28 last year, some 21.6 million SMEs in the non‐financial business sector employed 88.8 million people and generated €3,666 trillion in value added. Expressed another way, 99 out of every 100 businesses are SMEs, as are 2 in every 3 employees and 58 cents in every euro of value added. It is important to note that while the prospects for SME success are tied with macro‐ economic developments, they by no means identically mirror all of them. As the majority of SMEs operate in sectors that serve domestic demand, for example, they did not share in the benefits of increased foreign demand, which was the key macro‐ economic driver of growth from 2008 to 2013. Many SMEs are not in export‐oriented sectors, particularly the micro and small enterprises. Thus, programs supporting SME exports benefit directly only a sub‐set of SMEs. However, indirectly, all SMEs benefit to some extent from growth in exports as higher exports raises a) overall income levels, and hence the demand for goods and services sold by domestic demand facing SMEs, and b) the demand for goods and services originating from exporting‐oriented enterprises. Yet in an increasingly internationalized world, there are competitive advantages for those businesses that begin with a global strategy and can move quickly to take advantage of cross‐border activities. Providing further, tailored support for this growing asset class would form a key step in allowing SMEs to leverage the benefits of increased foreign demand. In the Basque Country we’re very much aware of this scenario and that’s why the Network consortium partners participating in this action have design a implementation plan aiming at contributing to the objectives of COSME and H2020. That is, facilitating access to European and international markets for Basque SMEs and by providing growth-oriented, integrated business and innovation support services that help strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability of the enterprises in our region.",1,1
437,78507,No,Chemical Looping Combustion CO2-Ready Gas Power,"Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a new, indirect combustion process with inherent separation of CO2. The CLC technology uses metal oxide particles for oxygen transfer from combustion air to fuel, thus CO2 is obtained in a separate stream without any ga s separation needed. The partners previous EU-project GRACE successfully demonstrated this new combustion technology for the first time, in more than 100 hours operation, and it was found to be one of the absolute best in the cost evaluation of CCP (CO2 C apture Project).  The process features 100% CO2 capture, a highly concentrated stream of CO2 ready for sequestration, no NOx emissions, and no costs or energy penalties for gas separation. CLC uses well-established boiler technology very similar to cir culating fluidized bed boilers, which also means that costs can be assessed with great accuracy. CLC is estimated to achieve CO2 capture cost reductions of 40 to 50% compared to todays best available technology, namely post combustion amine scrubbing. Critical issues for an up-scaling of CLC to a demonstration phase of 20-50 MWe have been identified and it is the objective of the project to establish and validate solutions to these. The project will: - establish industrial-scale metal oxide particle production including availability of suitable commercial raw materials, and also investigate alternate production paths and effects of gas impurities - extend operational experience in long term tests of particles in available prototype, #gt;1000 hour s - scale up process to 100/200 kWth with advanced features, using existing CFB rig  - extend and verify modelling capability for scale-up  - perform process and technology scale-up to prepare for industrial 20-50 MWe demonstration unit and pro duce update of economic assessment The project will strengthen the partners world-leading position on CLC and grow European capability to deliver a leading edge CO2 capture technol",0,0
895,188070,No,Feedback Regulated Star Formation in Diverse Galactic Environments,"Three major unresolved issues in modern Astrophysics are the origin of the initial mass function of stars and it potential universality, the nature and interplay of physical processes that regulate the star formation rates and efficiencies in star forming molecular clouds, and the origin of turbulent motions in the clouds and in the interstellar medium. Over the last two decades, the effects of physical processes such as turbulence, magnetic fields, and stellar feedback on the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds have been modeled. However, a global analysis that incorporates all of these processes in a single set of simulations is still missing. The aim of this project is to provide a complete picture of the entire life cycle of molecular clouds that form and evolve in different galactic environments. Using high resolution numerical simulations, I will model the formation of molecular clouds from converging flows in the atomic phase of the ISM, the fragmentation of the clouds and the formation of stars within them, and the ways feedback from the newly formed stars impacts the dynamics of the clouds and leads to their dispersal. In additiona to exploring a large variety of galactic environments characterized by different gas-phase metallicities and magnetic field strengths, the simulations will include novel aspects such as the coupling of a state-of-the art magnteohydrodynamical code (RAMSES AMR code) with a state-of-the-art stellar evolution code (MESA code). This will allow me to follow very accurately and self-consistently the effects of feedback from massive stars on their parental molecular clouds. The results from this large set of simulations will allow me to evaluate the dependence of the shape of the IMF and of the star formation rates and efficiencies on the environment. I will also be able to quantify the contribution of massive stars on driving turbulent motions in molecular clouds and in the ISM.",0,0
595,38652,No,Environmental planning and control system for industrial logistic networks,"Tackling the international problem of industrial pollution has become one of the biggest tasks of the ending millennium. In this context, the much discussed 'end-of-the-pipe' technologies move the problem to the end of the life-cycle of a product or to the end of the production process, without causing lasting alterations. In addition, the isolated focus on a company's production processes creates sub-optima which do not permit to profit from the potentials of the co-ordination of inter-company processes. It is therefore necessary to establish production integrated environmental protection of the whole logistical chain, though this will lead to a new dimension of complexity for the manufacturing industry. It is the aim of EPSILON to develop a software toolset which will facilitate the design and control of production systems within industrial logistic networks under environmental goals and constraints.  The aim of the EU Eco-Audit or the upcoming ISO14000 is to certify that a company is continually improving its eco-policy and is defining quantifiable environmental targets. To make these objectives applicable for the persons responsible for the production and product design, the user companies of the EPSILON consortium aim to produce a tool which will,  - Support the reduction of waste and pollution and reduce the environmental impact by supporting the design and controlling of inter-company material flow and the production processes themselves and in relation to their specific environmental impact under economic constraints;  - Provide on-line feedback of the environmental behaviour of the logistical processes according to the environmental targets;  - Monitor the environmental performance and initial environmental burden of products and processes both over the whole supply-chain and the production process;  - Allocate to products and processes the environmental burden according to their specific 'history'.  EPSILON will produce a logistics process model which allows the integration of environmental and economic aspects and develop an easy-to-use and adaptable environmental planning, control and simulation system for industrial logistic networks. It will establish environmental oriented feedback mechanisms between the planned performance of inter-company logistics processes and create feedback mechanisms as input for the product design. In addition it will provide comparative figures for the quantification of the environmental 'rucksack' of products and provide an open interface between this tool and existing production management systems.",0,0
610,17013,No,European Urban Corridor Control,"The objective of the EUROCOR project is to develop and implement (by field trials on two test sites) models and on-line control strategies for the effective management of traffic in urban corridors (integrated urban networks and motorways) including traffic signals, ramp metering and VMS. The European urban corridor control (EUROCOR) project involves the development and implementation (by field trials on 2 test sites) of models and online control strategies for the effective management of traffic in urban corridors (integrated urban networks and motorways).  A literature review was performed, addressing existing urban, interurban and corridor traffic models and control tools, potentially suited for developing and evaluating advanced traffic control strategies within an integrated motorway/arterial urban corridor. The review included a preliminary screening of 67 candidate models and 30 control tools followed by a more detailed evaluation process that resulted in 6 short listed models, which appear suitable for the project's purposes and were recommended for further analysis, modification and application.  After the review evaluation, 2 of the short listed models (namely SSMT and METANET) have been finally selected for integration. Model integration included specifications, theoretical investigations, software development, and preliminary testing. The integrated corridor traffic model was given the name METACOR and will be used in the near future for offline testing of control strategies. Moreover, a further 4 short listed models will be used in the course of the project's investigations for one or both network sites. A feasibility study for the 2 test sites was performed, consisting of the networks statement, the control techniques statement, the application details, and the evaluation requirements and procedures. The final part of this feasibility study was the comparative appraisal where both sites were compared with respect to their requirements and characteristics.  Last achievement has been the development of preliminary functional and architectural requirements for both sites as well as the first field trial results related to the assessment of the impact of ramp metering on the Urban Corridor Peripherique traffic. Technical Approach   The overall technical approach includes specification, system analysis, software development, implementation, and evaluation of integrated urban corridor modelling and control tools. A main intention is to establish flexible control approaches for urban corridors, to allow for different operational requirements in different corridor situations so as to encourage wide application of effective urban corridor control management. The work programme to be carried out within the project will allow both the development of the basic tools for corridor modelling and control and their application to real interactive motorway/urban route situations.   The application areas are two corridor sites which have partially different user requirements, traffic and environmental conditions and road and network characteristics. The different implementation tasks will have their own timing and method for each site, but a coordinated plan has been specified both to guarantee the achievement of the primary overall objectives and to ensure that the evaluation procedures lead to results that allow direct comparison between sites. Moreover, as much of the work as possible will be made common to both sites, in order to optimise the use of the resources available.   The project structure includes seven main stages: Review and assessment, feasibility, development and validation, off-line studies, on-line implementation, evaluation and recommendations.   The first stage was a critical review of corridor systems and urban and interurban control tools. In the second stage all aspects of the feasibility of implementing the intended control approach on the test sites were examined. This has been followed by the necessary development and off-line studies and will lead to the most important stage of the project, namely the on-site implementation and evaluation of the control approach. The final task will be to produce recommendations, based on the results of the evaluation studies, for the generalized application of urban corridor control throughout Europe, including operational specifications.   Key Issues   Enhancement of existing macroscopic simulation models.  Integration of urban traffic models with inter-urban traffic flow models.  Evaluation of the impact of ramp metering on the Urban Corridor Traffic  Development of tools for use in the on-line control of urban corridors  Validation of the new modelling approaches, in isolation, against appropriate existing real data and their subsequent integration into a single model for application to on-line control.  Specification and development of the necessary on-line control software.  Implementation through appropriate pilot projects of the on-line control on two urban corridor sites in Paris and in Amsterdam, each having partially different characteristics in terms of geometric structure and traffic demand.  Detailed evaluation of the field trials.  Recommendations for the implementation of urban corridor control by using RTI systems.   Expected Achievements   The METACOR Urban Corridor model will be validated, while the traffic assignment modelling, the integrated control design, the off-line simulation testings, the overall integrated system architecture and the field trials specifications, design and evaluation will be performed, during the lifetime of the project.   Expected Impact   The main purpose of EUROCOR is the development and demonstration of an integrated traffic control strategy using urban and inter-urban control tools.   The impact of the project could be significant if it can:   satisfy the requirements of users and operators for more efficient traffic control  develop marketable prototypes.   Furthermore, a specific emphasis will be to provide easy and cost effective solutions for the application of new RTI systems developed in the field of traffic control.   Finally the EUROCOR approach shall reflect the need to come as early as possible to European - Internationally accepted traffic control strategies and specifications permitting the development of a universal environment of RTI based traffic control system.   In the technological area, EUROCOR will try to link the strategies for urban control with those for interurban control, by applying them to the sites and therefore improving the information exchange between the various 'actors' in the traffic scene, and offering a 'package' solution of obvious European value.   Contribution to Standardization   During the planning and execution of the EUROCOR pilots, various existing standards will be applied and tested in practice.   The whole work will contribute within its scope of application to a wide range of topics including:   Functional specifications  Recommendation for standards  Evaluation of operability of Road transport informatics in Europe  Recommendations regarding safety aspects  Commercial use and benefits of Road transport informatics in Europe",0,0
681,31830,No,Eco-management accounting as a tool of environmental management.,"To explore how environmental costs and benefits can be systematically incorporated into the measurement of corporate economic and environmental performance.  OBJECTIVES:  To explore how environmental costs and benefits can be systematically incorporated into the measurement of corporate economic and environmental performance.   DESCRIPTION:  An accounting framework (the Ecomac Framework) which indicates how environmental costs and benefits can be systematically incorporated into the measurement of economic and environmental performance is developed and tested. The Ecomac Framework applies to both capital budgeting and the optimisation of business operations.  The project explores the central hypothesis that a systematic linking of management accounting with environmental management improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of environmental measures. The interface needed to establish an effective system for the monitoring of environmental costs and benefits is investigated for a broad range of cases.  A survey among 20 companies in each of the countries involved (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands) shows the range of problems connected with the linkage of management accounting with environmental management; it also indicates their relative importance. The survey results are then used in the selection of the in-depth case studies (at least four in each country involved). These case studies are both exploratory, dealing with specific environmental problems, their management-accounting implications and are illustrative in sofar that they involve best practice in the way management accounting serves to monitor the environmental costs and benefits of existing operations and under-pin possible environmental measures.  The dissemination of the results are emphasized throughout the project. A Policy and Scientific Review Panel is established to provide feed back on the policy and the scientific relevance of the project's results in its various phases. The project provides for the production of training materials for environmental managers and the provision of seminars for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME's).",1,0

This research examines how class is made and imagined in instances in which transnational processes of global capitalism release both capital and labour from the confines of a single nation state, and what remains of the nation state’s role as the guardian of particular class interests and in managing change. The answer will be provided by a multi-sited ethnographic analysis of posted work, one of the flagship European Union projects which involves the transnational subcontracting of foreign labour for short-term projects under the provision of service. The analysis will be conducted from the perspective of Polish workers posted to Belgium, their direct employers and the Polish state as the leading European state who posts labour abroad. By bringing to the fore the transnationally and culturally sensitive investigation of class, the research will help to understand current economic situation and power struggles, and to gauge the practical and political possibilities for action towards a more just and equal European society, including providing an informed basis on which to create posted work regulations, currently under the debate by the European Commission. At the theoretical level, the research will offer a fruitful cross-fertilization, whereby ethnographically sensitive, anthropological inquiry will inform industrial relations research and help to reconceptualize class in the transnational era.

25,212712,Yes,Work on Demand: Contracting for Work in a Changing Economy,"Labour law as a scholarly discipline is widely believed to be in crisis. Since the time of its birth, both the nature of working relationships and the context within which they are formed and regulated have changed significantly. The difficulty for scholars is that old concepts don’t perform the function anymore of making sense of the field. Old arguments about the need to protect workers’ interests are met with counterarguments, informed by neoclassical economics, that protective measures inhibit economic growth and increase unemployment.  The WorkOD project aspires to nothing less than a fundamental transformation of the discipline of labour law across the whole of Europe and beyond. Understanding the crisis to have at its heart a crisis of methodology, it aims to develop a new methodology for the study of the key legal concept of the contract for work. It aims to explain trends in the field of work organisation and working relationships and to assess the significance of particular labour market institutions to the achievement of policy goals in a way that is useful to scholars and policy-makers. And it aims to pave the way for future contributions by scholars to policy debates, so that they may influence in positive ways the identification of new economically and socially sustainable solutions to the problem of the division of responsibilities and risks between workers and those for whom they work.  In a marked departure from the state of the art, the project defines contracting for work as an instance of economic, social and legal behaviour, influenced in a variety of ways by the institutional context within which it proceeds. Rejecting the reframing of labour law according to a full blown market paradigm, it argues instead for the utility of sociological methods. Its development of a new methodology begins from a combination of micro and macro perspectives, and a synthesis of approaches drawn from economic sociology, political economy and the sociology of law.",1,1

The project contends that an important component of these relations has been the trade-off between the foreign support channelled in the form of aid to governments in the Middle East and benefits (regional stability, regime stabilities) ensured for such support. The research aims (1) to track the recent changes of Western (EU, to lesser extent US) aid policies in the MENA countries involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how they are applied in an attempt to control regional developments; (2) to understand local perceptions on aid-related foreign interventions and on political elites and/or regimes (3) to understand how Western aid policies have contributed to the Arab Spring and how the focus of Western aid has been changing; to evaluate the function and overall ‘price’ of foreign aid – social costs and externalities included – from the perspective of the donors and from that of the recipients.",1,0
235,405,Yes,PRICE AND WAGE FORMATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT PERSISTENCE,"The debate between New Classical and New Keynesian macroeconomists underlines the importance of the issue of price and wage adjustment for the understanding of business cycle fluctuations. Both the extent to which nominal changes and the adjustment of relative prices to real shocks have been stressed as crucial (see T. Andersen, publication no2 for a survey). A better understanding of the sources of these rigidities and in particular their empirical form is a preresequite for a correct understanding of economic fluctuations and thus for an adequate design of economic policies. It is precisely the aim of this project to extend our knowledge about price and wage adjustment in European countries.  It should be clear from the outset that the project is not confined to the study of simple equation systems of wage and price formation in its own right, but considers these issues in relation to the more ambitious question of the causes and remedies for unemployment.",1,1
107,208291,Yes,Networking for innovation: how entrepreneurs' network behaviours help clusters to innovate,"In recent years, economic geography has strongly embraced the relational approach: entrepreneurs striving to generate innovations have been shown to benefit from embeddedness in local, cohesive networks if these are combined with connectivity to sparse, global ties that bring diversity. With this heightened importance of networks for innovation, it is rather surprising that academic research has nearly entirely overlooked the role of “networking”. Networks are portrayed as if they are formed exclusively through latent preferences to connect with certain people or through contextual factors that make people accidently connect. This leaves little space for entrepreneurs’ deliberate attempts to create the social capital they believe will help them innovate. We thus lack the micro-level theoretical foundations of the network-innovation relationship in economic geography. My research aims to build these foundations by developing a network behavioural approach to innovation in entrepreneurial clusters. I seek to investigate how within-cluster variation in entrepreneurs’ innovation performance may originate in differences in network behaviour and how between-cluster variation in performance may originate in the spread of effective network behaviours within but not between clusters. Answers to these questions should lead to fundamentally new insights into why certain clusters thrive as hubs of innovation and why certain entrepreneurs within clusters contribute more to the innovation in clusters than others. I will collect granular qualitative and quantitative data of the network behaviours of entrepreneurs through interviews, multi-wave surveys and online network monitoring tools to unveil how they decide which ties to build and which ones to call on in specific situations. I will then assess how these behaviours enable or constrain entrepreneurs and, in aggregate, clusters to innovate using large-scale econometric analyses as well social science experiments.",1,1
214,221707,Yes,The missing pillar. European social policy and Eurosceptic challenges (SOCIALEU),"Present scholarship insufficiently addresses the linkages between Euroscepticism and supranational solidarity. On the one hand, scholars studying Euroscepticism argue that the lack of perceived benefits of the integration process explains EU citizens' opposition to their country membership in the union. However, this stream of literature does not inquire whether supranational social policies have the potential to change individuals’ perception of gains and losses related to European integration. On the other hand, the normative approach to European citizenship arguing for a transnational conception of justice and solidarity does not fully engage with the consequences of a social solidarity pillar in the EU. The SOCIALEU project builds on these two theoretical perspectives and investigates the role of a redistributive EU social policy in fostering citizen support for the Union. In particular, the project analyses the agenda-setting on social rights at the supranational level and subsequently inquires whether the provision of social benefits by EU institutions increases support for European integration and has the potential to turn populist party voters towards mainstream political parties. In doing so, the SOCIALEU project is the first theoretical and empirical undertaking that investigates the role that supranational social policy may have in changing people’s attitudes and voting behaviour in relation to the EU. I rely on the literature on welfare states’ role in strengthening national identity and social cohesion  and argue that the provision of welfare goods at the EU level can strengthen support for the EU in general and among Eurosceptic citizens in particular. I employ an original research design that combines qualitative research in Brussels and survey experiments in France and Spain.",1,1
225,44637,Yes,Measurement of the labour market effects of disability on household welfare,"Research objectives and content  Disability imposes many costs upon the individual. This project proposes to measure the costs of disability which occur through the operation of the labour market. One of the major innovations of the project is that it examines the effects of disability on the labour market in both a static and dynamic framework. The project has three main parts: first is the estimation of household welfare for the disabled via their labour market characteristics, secondly the measurement of the factors affecting labour market transitions for the disabled and finally the estimation of whether and how much discrimination against the disabled exists in the labour market.  The initial part of the project involves the estimation of participation and labour supply for the disabled. This will enable us to examine how the labour market experience for the disabled differs from that for the fully-abled. From the estimation of participation and labour supply equations, measures of household welfare via the real wage function can be calculated and the welfare loss owing to the different labour market outcomes for the disabled can be evaluated. This analysis may also permit estimation of the welfare effects of various proposed reforms. The second part of the project introduces the dynamic framework in to the analysis. Here we propose to examine transitions between labour market states for the disabled and evaluate what factors are important. This can be performed using the techniques of multiple state transition models and the estimation of the relevant hazard functions to determine whether and how disability affects labour market transitions. For example, it will be possible to estimate how disability affects the probability of becoming unemployed and also how it may affect the probability of returning back to employment from a state of unemployment. This represents a major extension of the work by Thompson and Walker (Disability, Wages and Labour Force Participation: Evidence from UK Panel Data, Keele Economics Working Paper 96/14).  In the final part of the project through examining wage equations for the disabled and using standard decomposition techniques. we can estimate whether and how much labour market discrimination exists against the disabled. The findings from this pan of the project can also feed back into the welfare analysis of the first pan of the project, since differences in wages and labour supply will have obvious welfare effects which can be evaluated using techniques such as real wage functions.  The project would benefit from being associated with a wider comparison between UK, US (using PSID data) and Germany (using GSOEP) to be funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Trust.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The major training content of this project is the use and microeconometric analysis of large micro data sets, in this particular case, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The Economics Dept. at Keele have considerable expertise in this field and the applicant could obviously benefit from such experience. It is expected that a period of training in the use and analysis of such data sets would be of considerable use to the applicant on return to his native country (where such data sets are now becoming generally available for use by research institutions), thus providing further benefits apart from those directly connected with the above project.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  The findings from this project will help firms to formulate policies for their disabled employees and respond to the Disability Act which comes into force on Dec 2, 1996. The Department at Keel has strong links with policy makers and pressure groups in the context of disability.",1,1

578,72081,No,Service Centric Systems Engineering,"The primary goal of the SeCSE IP proposal is to create methods, tools and techniques for system integrators and service providers and to support the cost-effective development and use of dependable services and service-centric applications. The proposal brings together IT companies, developers and research labs and is driven by the emerging needs in the automotive and telecommunications industries. Technically, SeCSE focuses on four areas for the engineering of sw systems: specification, discovery, design, and management of services for which new techniques and tools will be delivered. These tools and techniques will be integrated to provide a SeCSE development environment and, based on visionary scenarios from application partners, domain-specific adaptations. The SeCSE development environment will be made available as open source software while other project results will form the basis of contributions to relevant standardisation bodies. Exploitation will be achieved through different routes but with the common theme of partners incorporating these results in current or planned products. SeCSE is integrated in the following ways: -Technically, through complementary problem areas addressed by strong research teams, -industrially, through multi-sectors application partners who share a common vision for the potential of services, -managerially, through a strong management structure based on entrepreneurial practices, internationally, with partners from 6 different countries, -personally, through strong existing working relationships between partners.To assure adequate future support to the SeCSE solutions we adopt an open sustainability approach: -using of open standards and the open source sw development, -based on an open community to enforce resources and input from researchers, scientists, professionals and users, -open to expansion, by inserting new application scenarios and project results in a 'plug and play' manner.",0,0
493,36124,No,Commercial fish and European estuaries - priorities for management and research,"The Concerted Action, which began in December 1996, aimed to produce a status report on European estuarine habitats in relation to fish and macro-crustaceans, especially their importance for commercial species and aquaculture. The project focussed on seven main theme chapters covering all aspects of the use of estuarine habitats by fishes. The themes included recruitment, habitat use, trophic interactions, estuarine development and habitat creation, environmental quality, and endangered and rare species. Chapter 1: Background to Research & Introduction This Chapter introduces the project and the subsequent topic Chapters. Chapter 2: Habitat Use by Fishes in Estuaries and other Brackish Areas This Chapter has concentrated on the significance and roles of selected habitats in the life cycle of commercial and other selected fish species. The habitats considered include sand and mud intertidal flats, subtidal estuarine sandbanks and estuarine subtidal muddy beds, seagrass beds, salt marsh and reed beds, shallow rocky areas, and tidal freshwater areas. The synthesis quantifies the contribution of selected habitats to commercial species' production and assesses the wide-scale usage of estuaries as nursery grounds. In order to complete the task, the habitat availability in the main and representative estuarine areas were quantified. Chapter 3: Recruitment of Commercial Species in Estuaries This Chapter has identified which commercial species are using estuaries and their component habitats, and considered the adequacy of available data to determine the amount of production (yield) which estuaries contribute. The synthesis covers the early life stage mortality, larval transport and the links with spawning and nursery areas both within and outwith the estuaries. In addition, the effects of commercial fisheries (both inside and outside estuaries) on estuarine stocks and on the bycatch has been identified. Chapter 4: Links between Fish and other Trophic Levels This Chapter has covered the relationships and interactions between commercial fish species (both as adult and in juvenile stages) within estuaries and the relationships and interactions between fish and other top predators e.g. seals, birds, cetaceans, humans. It has allowed definition of the food web structure within European estuaries and their component habitats and thus has given the relationship and interactions with the lower consumers (cephalopoda, crabs, shrimps). In this way the synthesis has assessed the importance of mysids and other hyperbenthos and especially the macro-crustaceans. In particular, the study has defined the number of food-chains within estuarine habitats and the importance of detritus and primary-production generated systems. Chapter 5: Endangered and Rare Species (including diadromous spp.) Estuaries have long been considered important for endangered and rare species, especially as some of those species, e.g. sturgeon and shad, may be of commercial importance in other regions of Europe. The importance of various estuarine habitats is considered within this Chapter, and the influence of barriers (water quality and physical barriers) is assessed in relation to the endangered and rare species such as smelt (Osmerus), shad (Alosa), sturgeons (Acipenser) and salmonids (Salmo). The case for re-introductions, as shown at various European estuaries, e.g. the Forth for smelt, has also been considered on a wider scale. This Chapter has particular relevance to the Directive on Habitats and Species, and to coastal zone management for fisheries support, conservation and human-use. The value of re-introductions and their role for captive breeding and translocations of species, and for the transmission of other species as parasites and commensals on commercial species, and the genetic consequences are important topics in European estuaries.  Chapter 6: Estuarine Development/Habitat Restoration and Re-creation and their Role in Estuarine Management for the Benefit of the Aquatic Resources The impact of estuarine human developments and uses is summarised by this Chapter. In particular, there is an assessment of the effects of the large use of polderising/land claim/channel management and the present movement towards restoration either naturally or man-made, or wetlands through depoldering, setback schemes or marsh creation. The suitability of restoring or modifying habitats for fish and other nekton has been considered together with an analysis of the importance of creek morphology and its dendritic structure. In some estuaries there has been a restoration of salinity gradients and thus it is necessary to consider this in relation to the fish and macro-crustaceans. This Chapter has discussed the changes to spawning grounds in relation to smothering, for example by dredging activities and the impact of artificial structures, port development, land-claim etc. as they change the habitat for estuarine fish. In this way, the project has assessed the management of estuaries as habitats for commercial and non-commercial fish and macro-crustaceans. Chapter 7: Environmental Quality of Estuaries including the Consideration of Environmental Quality Indices This Chapter brings together information on the effects of pollutants and the development of water quality barriers both naturally, as often experienced in estuaries, and as the result of human activities. Information is given with regard to trends in the recovery of anthropogenically damaged estuaries, for example as the result of pollution remediation schemes. The influence of aquaculture (both intensive and extensive) on environmental quality is also considered. The report presents and discusses Environmental and Ecological Quality Objectives and Standards (EcoQO, EcoQS, EQO, EQS) and habitat classification schemes as mechanisms for managing estuaries to benefit the fish and macrocrustacean populations. Chapters 8 & 9: Field Methods (Methodological Harmonisation & Standardisation) and Data Analysis & Interpretation (Analytical Quality Control/Quality Assurance) This topic is divided into two Chapters, Field Methods (Chapter 8) and Data Analysis & Interpretation (Chapter 9). The Chapters describe the available scientific/commercial fishing methods, through a large matrix showing the main features and advantages and disadvantages, and subsequently presents means of standardisation and harmonisation between workers. This includes the nature and adequacy of techniques in use for studying fish and macro-crustaceans in estuaries, in particular analyses of data (including gear performance, suitability and efficiency and the adequacy of data produced), and the role and value of international and national methods' quality assurance schemes in the production of fisheries and fish biology data in estuaries. The synthesis considers the reproducibility and consistency of methods within groups and the value and possibility of an Analytical Quality Control and Quality Assurance scheme for the studies, both for taxonomy and the field and laboratory methods. The development of AQC/QA schemes for fish studies is a new and novel approach and is following similar schemes for environmental chemistry and benthic biology. The standardisation of methods between groups is particularly important although the studies of the estuarine and brackish habitats by definition require the use of many types of methods. Chapter 10: Discussion, Recommendations and Further Work This Chapter summaries the research undertaken within the Concerted Action and indicates which areas and aspects require further study. The Concerted Action has succeeded by organising workshops and in bringing together workers from a variety of Institutions throughout Europe, together with corresponding members from South Africa and Australia. A bibliographic database has been created containing over 2650 references searchable by author, editor, date, title, journal, abstract or keywords. The WWW page for the project has also been constructed and information about the Concerted Action can be found under the 'Projects' heading on the Institutes website located at www.hull.ac.uk/iecs. The format and result of the project has been, and continues to be disseminated through several avenues. As a first step, the description and components of the project, together with a request for information, was included in the Bulletin (Issue 24, February 1997) of the Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association. This newsletter goes to 1000 members and libraries worldwide and resulted in several contacts being made and thus the access to further, unpublished studies. The extended abstract for the project has been submitted to the EU publication summarising FAIR and MAST projects. Additionally, papers produced as the result of collaboration through the project have either been published/submitted, or are currently in press. Results from the Concerted Action were disseminated via presentation of papers at the ECSA 30 International Meeting held in Hamburg, Germany between 9-13 August 1999. One of the aims of the project was for the final report to be published in its entirety in the open literature. Several publishers were contacted and expressed an interest in publishing the volume, and a contract has now been signed with Blackwell Sciences Ltd. for the manuscript of the Concerted Action to be published as a book with a provisional working title of 'Fishes in Estuaries'.

Additionally, 3 of the participants (Dr. Mike Elliott, Dr. Andre Cattrijsse and Kris Hostens) were invited to a discussion workshop in Den Haag, The Netherlands in December 1997, to consider the research and management of the Westerschelde in relation to the fish fauna. The participants were able to include a wider discussion from the Concerted Action. The Co-ordinator, M Elliott was also invited to join the SCOR105 (Standing Committee on Oceanographic Research) working group on the effects of fisheries on estuarine ecosystems, to bring the European perspective and to link with the Concerted Action. The summary from the present project is being incorporated into the report for the SCOR105 working group and was presented at its workshop held in Halifax, NS in March 1998. Finally, the project has established links with the XENOFISH (Effects of Xenobiotics on marine fishes) project (Concerted Action, ref. CT97.3827) and some results from it were presented at the latter's workshop held in Oslo, February 1998. REFERENCES Blaber, S.J.M., 1991.

INTRODUCTION Estuaries have long been regarded as important sites for fish, both as nursery and over wintering sites, migration routes and areas which naturally support large numbers of fish (Haedrich, 1983). Similarly, the impact of human activities on the fishes' habitat and the role of fish study in estuarine management has received much attention (e.g. Elliott et al., 1988; Costa & Elliott, 1991; Pomfret et al., 1991). Much of the previous information has been the result of studies on single estuaries (e.g. Hamerlynck et al., 1993; Elliott & Taylor, 1989) or at most on two or three estuaries (Pomfret et al., 1991;, Costa & Elliott, 1991; Hovenkamp & van der Veer, 1993). There have been studies of inshore fish assemblage structure within countries (e.g. Henderson, 1989) and of environmental factors influencing fishes (Thiel et al., 1995). Within the southern hemisphere, there have been extensive studies of estuarine fish assemblages (Blaber 1991; Blaber et al., 1989) but it is of note that prior to the study of Elliott & Dewailly (1995) within Europe there have been no previous studies which compare estuarine fish assemblages over large geographical areas. Similarly, although there have been studies identifying the general role of estuaries as nursery areas (e.g. Elliott et al., 1990; Marchand, 1993), the nursery function of differing habitats within estuaries has not been quantified. The public interest in Europe is increasingly focusing on the protection, conservation and surveillance of the natural environment, including estuaries. This is especially so as estuaries are regions where marine and diadromous fish are in a intensive contact with anthropogenic water pollution and other forms of environmental degradation (e.g. channelisation). This is of particular importance for the estuarine nursery function such that the understanding of processes determining the present nursery function of estuaries is necessary in order to develop restoration and preservation programmes for estuarine and marine habitats and to exploit the living fish resources without threatening the aquatic ecosystems. The development of estuaries as a habitat and biologically sustainable resource is necessary. This feature requires an understanding of the value of the different estuarine habitats found within Europe (e.g. Drake & Arias 1991a,b; Costa et al., 1994; Cattrijsse et al., 1994). Because of these features, the present study attempts to produce a synthesis of current and recent studies within Europe although information is also included from studies worldwide.",0,0
236,214786,Yes,"Catching–Up along the Global Value Chain: models, determinants and policy implications in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution","Catching-Up along the global value chain: business models, determinants and policy implications in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (CatChain) is a project built on a multidisciplinary and multi-sectorial exchange program focused on unravelling the process of Catching-Up from different sectorial perspectives at a country level. It analyses the role of business models (BMs) in entering, learning and upgrading the Global Value Chain (GVC), aiming at recognising the determinants and challenges faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in tackling the process of upgrading in a globalising economy. The outcome of the project will be the definition of policy tools and frameworks to support effective policy-making actions in the implementation of Research and Innovation Smart Specialization Strategy (RIS3), with respect to the new agenda of Europe 2020, mainly for low-income EU countries. The main aims of the project are: 1.to identify: if and how a country should focus on developing domestic trade networks and upgrading before entering into GVCs; whether it should improve its infrastructures in regional value chains implementing the RIS3 strategy for its economic transformation; 2.to study the emerging BMs underpinning the successful entry, learning, and upgrading in GVCs, after the investigation and valuation of case studies in different sectors and countries; 3.to isolate the conditions that define the preferable entry strategy; 4.to recognise the policy framework that facilitates entries and supports SMEs in developing a profitable business strategy.   To give robust scientific answers to the question of whether entering GVCs by sponsoring one large national firm or a set of small and dynamic enterprises, CatChain intends to bridge the Catching-Up approach with the GVCs literature, paying attention to the role that entry, learning and upgrading strategies – integrated with BMs, play in fostering a process of country-level catching-up in distinct sectors.",1,1
129,59758,Yes,Coalition Theory Network,"This proposal is for a series of three conferences, to be held on a yearly basis, starting January 2002. These meetings are set in the framework of the Coalition Theory Network, an organisation jointly held by Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Venice; Center for Operational Research and Econometrics, Louvain; Universite de Marseille; Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and the Southern Methodist University of Dallas. This network brings together the leading scientists in the theory of coalition formation, and is admittedly the only existing series of high level academic meetings on this topic.  The time schedule for the next three meetings is as follows: - January2002: FEEM, Venice; - January 2003: Universite de Marseille; - January 2004: Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. The objective of these meetings is twofold: to allow for rapid and continuous exchange of scientific results among leading scholars and between scholars and young researchers in the field; to allow for a close collaboration among academic researchers in fields related to coalition formation theory (e.g., climatologists and natural scientists) and between academics and policy makers, whose attendance has considerably increased in time. Group formation is certainly one of the most relevant feature of modern economic and social systems. Agents form groups (or 'coalitions') for various reasons: exploiting economies of scale (nations, regions, R&D associations) or a stronger market or bargaining position (unions, cartels), risk sharing (economic unions), solving inefficiencies due to uncoordinated policies (international cooperation), satisfying basic communication needs (formation of relational networks). The increasing importance of these phenomena calls for a better understanding of the incentives to communicate and form coalitions in various economic and social environments in problems characterised by high degrees of irreversibility (such as sustainable development, exploitation of exhaustible resources, formation of communication infrastructures), the need for sharp predictions and policy recommendations is particularly compelling since the timing of cooperation has serious effects on the welfare of future generations. Although the relevance and urgency of these issues are generally acknowledged, a unanimously accepted theoretical framework of analysis is still missing. One of the main objectives of the proposed series of conferences is to encourage and coordinate research along two main lines. 1. The pursue of a general theory of coalition formation, predicting which groups will form as a consequence of the self - interested actions of socio-economic agents.

467,217885,No,Self-installable device that converts intercoms into a smart keys to allow access from anywhere.,"A rising number of customers are becoming increasingly accustomed to convenience. People are buying more and more online – the e commerce market reached €1.9 trillion worldwide in 2018, a 26% jump from 2016. As such, retailers now need to compete on convenience as well as price. Nevertheless, delivery is the biggest challenge to e-commerce. Though access control is seen to be more convenient for delivery options, it is fraught with difficulties.   Nello One is the only plug and play smart lock solution that gives hallway access at a highly affordable price. It is a smart upgrade for intercoms that works with a Wi-Fi-enabled chip to transmit the bell and door buzzer signals of intercoms via Wi-Fi to the cloud. The Nello One app is connected with our cloud so the app informs users when someone has buzzed and after they give permission, Nello One instantly opens the hallway door – no matter where they are. Nello One is uniquely placed within the housing access market -there are 220M households in Europe giving us huge potential market.   Our management team is made of the 5 co-founders and a new employee. This product idea originally started in November 2014 followed by a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015 and in 2017 we registered an annual turnover of €192,540 with a balance sheet showing €1.68M.

We are now seeking for a further investment of €1.5M to further develop the technology, run a large pilot test and redefine value chain in order to optimise the production and penetrate a larger market.  The proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME Instrument fits into our overall plan to reach the market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast sound wider deployment of Nello One and its market uptake.",0,0
447,186071,No,Remediation and mitigation of CO2 leakage,"Safety, reliability and controllability are essential elements influencing the public perception and licensing of CO2 storage. Therefore a thorough analysis of leakage mechanisms and threats to the safety and security of storage will be the first activity in the MiReCOL project. This will form the basis for an analysis of mitigation and remediation options. Both existing (state-of-the-art) and new remediation and mitigation techniques will be investigated, including laboratory tests of sealant materials and field demonstrations at the sites of Ketzin (Germany) and Bečej (Serbia). Additional field experiments that cannot be afforded by MiReCOL only will be shared with top-ranked US and Australian partners. The approach in MiReCOL is strictly risk based, which ensures that the results of the project can feed into the regulatory process (protocols, safety regulations, guidelines). This means that the impact of each remediation and mitigation measure is assessed on all relevant risk levels. The results will be published both as handbook and as an interactive web-based tool, to inform both storage project operators and competent authorities on the options available for remediation and mitigation. The inclusion of industrial partners active in CO2 storage ensures the operational experience to assess the efficiency and impact of each measure.",0,0
937,60960,No,Safe and Comfortable Driving based upon inter-vehicle communication,"The growing mobility on European roads generates a growing need for safety, efficiency and comfort to be provided by the traffic system. Improvement of traffic safety is gained by increasingly advanced driver assistance functions. CarTALK 2000 aims at improving safety through assistance systems based on inter-vehicle communication. Maximum traffic safety can only be reached with a real-time dynamic network that supports co-operative driving. As co-operative driving is becoming one of the key issues discussed in ADASE, the realisation of interactive driver assistance systems represents a significant step towards the ultimate vision of an accident-free traffic. The objectives of CarTALK 2000 are to design, develop, test and demonstrate co-operative driver assistance systems, to build up the technology for the required safety related ad hoc radio networks, as well as to evaluate the socio-economic and legal issues raised by this field.  Objectives: -Development of co-operative driver assistance systems based on inter-vehicle communication. - Specification of today's and future applications for co-operative driver assistance systems. - Develop software structures and algorithms, i.e. new fusion techniques - Test and demonstrate assistance functions in probe vehicles in real traffic scenarios. -Development of a self-organising radio system for inter-vehicle and vehicle. -infrastructure communication - Algorithms for radio ad-hoc networks with extremely high dynamic network topologies. - Integrate the communication system into test vehicles to test and demonstrate both, info-mobility applications (existing applications) and safety applications in the same system architecture.  Apart from technological goals, CarTALK 2000 actively addresses market introduction strategies including cost/benefit analyses and legal aspects, and aims at the standardisation to bring these systems to the European market.  Work description: To achieve the project goals the project will go through six phases: Analysis of system requirements, functional specifications, system architecture, communication protocol and application development, integration into test vehicles, validation of the applications in real conditions, standardisation and exploitation planning.  These project phases in are mapped onto five technical work packages (WP) and will be supported by an organisational work package (WP01) covering the operational project management. WP02, Enabling research and Specification, investigates all technical areas, specifies the communication-based assistance systems, decides upon scenarios for the verification phase, and identifies requirements for the communication system and the technological solutions to be used. WP03, System architecture, combines both, co-operative assistance systems and ad-hoc communication networks in a common architecture. Building the framework for the project work, this work package also ensures functional safety of the applications and protocols. WP04, Communication system, designs the radio communication system. A prototype is realised for testing in the selected scenarios. The design phase will develop a system, which is open to other applications as well. Specific recommendations will be defined for the phase after the technological prototype development, the pre-industrialisation, and protocols are brought to appropriate standards. WP05, Applications, will develop extended driver assistance systems based upon communication. A set of test vehicles will be built up for test and demonstration. WP06, Standardisation and market introduction, defines and analyses introduction scenarios for system deployment and technology implementation. Supporting work on standardisation, legal and liability issues and the socio-economic impact of CarTALK 2000 systems is carried out partly in close co-operation with other projects.  Milestones: Month 9: end of WP02; initial research is done; application scenarios are defined and operational requirements are specified; initial analyses on socio-economic benefits and legal requirements are finished, work on system architecture and application design can start. Month 15: end of design and development and end of safety analyses for communication system; demonstration and field trials can start, as the system will be available on demonstrator vehicles.

616,16884,No,"Evaluation of biological, technical and economical aspects of eel farming in intensive recirculation systems","The aims of the projects are :   to analyse economic feasibility of eel farming in intensive systems in general and to quantify the effect of technical and biological factors on this feasibility. Secondly to evaluate to what extend the EC subsidy-policy for aquaculture has contributed to or will contribute to development of eel farming in Denmark and The Netherlands.   to analyse bottlenecks in the biological and technical design of intensive eel farms and their impact on the profitability of eel farming in general.  Data have been collected from eels farms on technical, biological and economical aspects mainly by means of questionnaires. The physical capacity of most farms in terms of maximum standing stock and feed load per day is sufficient to enable the projected production. Measurement of flows in farms have demonstrated that these are in general considerably less than planned due to bad design. Optimization of the output of pumps in existing systems will enable larger standing stocks to be kept and improve profitability.   Biological data on growth, feed conversion and density have been collected based on the grading data of farms. The growth figures show that the growth of eels is often overestimated. At least 9 months are needed on average to go from 15 to 150 g giving growth rates of a total ideal standing stock of 0.75% per day.  Overall feed conversion ratios vary between 1.43 and 2.65 indicating that in this field there is a lot to be gained for most farmers.  Costs and earning of the farms participating were extensively analysed. Moreover a simulation model with input of collected data from 1 year has been used to analyse economic feasibility in the long term and to perform a sensitivity analysis.   Net losses in the first few years are inevitable. The question is to what extent these losses are acceptable and can be earned back. To analyse this, a minimum loss and profit path for a period of 10 years has been estimated.  The economic simulation model shows that the output of an eel farm is extremely sensitive to changes in eel growth rate. The main reason for the poor economic performance can be attributed to overestimated growth rates in the planning period. Better planning of the production with emphasis on biological and technical items that could enhance growth is needed. The programme contains an economical part covered by LEI (Netherlands) and DIFER (Denmark) and a biological /technical part covered by RIVO (Netherlands) and DAI (Denmark). Since most of the recent developments in intensive eel farming occur in Denmark and The Netherlands a comparable programme will be executed in both countries.   The economic research will be aimed at an evaluation of the economic viability of intensive eel farming. The economic research will involve the following activities:   Formulation of a questionnaire in order to obtain economic information from eel-farmers and eel-wholesalers. Contacts with farmers and wholesalers and their organisations will be established in the spring of 1989. Information from wholesalers will be used to obtain data on developments of the market and prices for farmed eel in the future. In this phase statistics on imports and exports of eel will be obtained.   Collection of the economic data from the farms in 1989 and the beginning of 1990.   Construction of a computer model for economical calculations.  Processing of the collected data and of the input from the biological technical research.  Evaluation of the viability of several types of farms and execution of a sensitivity analyses with the most important parameters for economic viability using collected empirical data and the computer model.   The biological/technical part of the programme will be directed towards the identification of bottlenecks in the biological and technical design of eel farms. This part of the programme will also produce some of the main input for the economical evaluation like growth and production data. This part of the research will involve the following activities:   Farmers and their organisations will be approached jointly with the people performing the economical research in order to obtain relevant biological and technical information. Data will be collected covering at least a period of one year on specific growth rates, stocking density, feed conversion, consumption of water, oxygen and energy, water quality, diseases and technical problems.

National Contact Points, created at the European level, have contributed to the creation of this European Research Area thanks to trans-national networking and facilitation of research integration. This joint effort has an objective to increase the EU research influence and image on the rest of the world, hence acting as a unique ICT market against the world market.  Nevertheless Europe growth and competitiveness depends in a significant way on its role outside the borders of the EU. In concrete, European ICT should not work in an isolated way, but should instead take advantage of contributions and feedbacks and open up to other countries of the World.  China is a huge and strategic market for EU, presenting not only complex and challenging features, but also with high opportunities and potential for the European Research Area. Furthermore, the long distance between EU and China, and the complex diversity of cultures, behaviours and modes of doing business, increases the importance of the creation of a physical presence in this country, a National IST cHinese Contact Point Contact Point (NI HAO).  NI HAO aims to promote EU ICT research activities and policies to the Chinese actors in the market, to allow both the EU and China to mutually benefit from each other in the present changing and transition period in China.

To achieve this ultimate objective the project is oriented to produce methods and tools to be used by emergency agencies and utility companies responsible for the management of FF/DF risks and associated effects. Impacts of future changes, including climatic, land use and socioeconomic will be analysed in order to provide guidelines for mitigation and adaptation measures. Specifically, the consortium will develop an integrated probabilistic forecasting FF/ DF system as well as a probabilistic early warning and a rule-based probabilistic forecasting system adapted to the operational use by practitioners. These systems will be tested on five selected flash flood prone areas, two located in mountainous catchments in the Alps, and three in Mediterranean catchments. The IMPRINTS practitioner partners, risk management authorities and utility company managers in duty of emergency management in these areas, will supervise these tests. The development of such systems will be carried out using and capitalising the results of previous and ongoing research on FF/DF forecasting and warning systems, in which several of the partners have played a prominent role. One major result of the project will be a operational prototype including the tools and methodologies developed under the project. This prototype will be designed under the premise of its ultimate commercialization and use worldwide.

925,13438,No,"OPTIMIZATION OF DOSE ASSESSMENT MODELS INCLUDING THE INTERFA CE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY, FOR USE IN CASE OF ACCIDENTAL RELEASES","THE RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A DOSE ASSESSMENT AND FORECASTING SYSTEM, OPTIMIZED AS AN AID FOR  DECISION MAKING, SUBSEQUENT TO A SEVERE NUCLEAR ACCIDENT. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY SIMULATION OF REFERENCE RELEASES AND APPLIED TO GENERATE SCENARIOS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE EXERCISES. THE FEASIBILITY OF ADJUSTMENT OF THE MATHEMATICAL SIMULATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BY FEEDBACK OF SURVEY RESULTS WILL BE EVALUATED. THE RESEARCH WORK IS COVERED BY THREE PROJECTS.   PROJECT 1 :    OPTIMISATION OF AN EMERGENCY DOSE ASSESSMENT AND FORECASTING SYSTEM.   PROJECT 2 :    FEASIBILITY STUDY OF FEEDBACK OF SURVEY RESULTS.   PROJECT 3 :    APPLICATION OF THE DOSE ASSESSMENT AND FORECASTING MODEL TO GENERATE REFERENCE SCENARIOS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING.  Following the general evolution in the world of nuclear safety analysis and emergency preparedness at nuclear sites, real time emergency assessment software packages have been developed for use during accidental situations. Until 1984, those packages, known as computer aided emergency response systems (CAERS), mainly performed atmospheric dispersion calculations. Since then the system has been optimised and extended to define realistic source terms to be included in dose assessments covering all exposure pathways of importance for decision making during the early emergency response phase. This main package is known as CAERSDOS.  CAERS: Basically the procedure CAERS, including an online version and an offline version, computes using a bigaussian dispersion model, half hour mean concentration values and deposition fluxes for a defined receptor configuration. A meteorological mast provides all the necessary parameters to run the model. These parameters are stored in a monthly cycling database, which permits the use of any half hour of the last 31 days. The offline version allows other combinations of turbulence typing schemes and dispersion parameter sets. The windvector puff trajectory model determines the centre of most of individually released puffs using 1 minute values for the windspeed and direction stored in the meteorological database. The trigaussian puff dispersion model allows a variable source term combined with a variable meteorological input.  CAERSDOS can be considered as the natural extension of CAERS towards a dose assessment model for use during accidental situations, as well as a tool to provide emergency scenarios for training purposes. The backbone of CAERS has been retained.  The study of the detailed requirements of the system lead to the selection of radionuclides and exposure pathways to consider, based on a review of existing safety studies. The radionuclides are classified according their important for early effects, late effects co mmitted during the passage of the cloud, those due to external irradiation by deposited materials and those due to consumption of contaminated food. The criterion of 1% of the total dose due to a specific pathway, lead to the selection of 37 radionuclides to cover the 4 kinds of exposure.  The selected exposure pathways are in order of importance: irradiation by deposited materials, inhalation and external irradiation by the cloud. A subroutine, dealing with the dynamic behaviour of iodine-131 in the grass-milk pathway can be linked to the system. A more extensive and systematic handling of foodchain contamination will be included in the near future.  A relative simple semianalytical source term simulator model hasbeen developed to provide the core inventory for a large pressurised water reactor (PWR) in function of power level, burn up and cooling time. This simulator is developed to define source terms for the 44 isotopes for up to 21 time intervals of half an hour. The user has to define the release fraction of the inventory in function of time for each physicochemical group of radionuclides.  A dose calculation module has been developed whereby for each half hour for which a source term has been provided, dose calculations are performed. The user can either introduce self defined meteorological situations or rely on the meteorological database. The doses are assessed for the following exposure pathways: cloud shine (effective and skin), inhalation (effective, lungs, thyroid and red bone marrow), external exposure by deposits (effective and skin for integration intervals of 1 hour, 1 day, 1 year and 30 years). The cloud shine dose is performed using the numerically determined ratios of finite to semiinfinite cloud shine. The user has to provide the fractions of elementary, organic and particulate iodine-131 to determine the effective deposition fluxes. The ingestion dose calculations, projected to be included very soon, will provide for the receptor with the greatest deposition the maximal concentration in milk, meat, green vegetables, grain and roots for the isotape iodine-131, caesium-137, strontium-90 and ruthenium-106.  The project evaluated the feasibility of updating some input parameters to the dose assessment model by comparison of environmental survey results to the corresponding values predicted by the model. The study examines the possibility of feedback of early environmental survey data to the model to increase the confidence in its results. Virtually all environmental survey data available up to now consist of concentration data gathered during tracer experiments. Therefore our attention has mainly been focussed towards the interaction of air concentration measurements on predictions. In simple terrain the main sources of uncertainty are source term, effective height, wind direction, dispersion parameters, and wind speed. The first optimisation scheme is based on the comparison, using a subjective acceptance criterion, of measured and calculated data. The main drawback of this procedure is the possible generation of solutions which fit well mathematically but without relations with the physical reality. Therefore a second optimisation scheme was considered which is based on a regression of measured data, assuming the validity of a general dispersion model. As will be shown in the tracer experiment examples, the best way to obtain a realistic set of model parameters is to sample on a few arcs centered around the ground level projection of the plume axis and located at both sides of the effective height dependent location of the ground level concentration (glc) maximum.  Relations between measurements and calculations of concentrations involved simulation of measurements with an exact bigaussian model and simulation of realistic measurements.  3 simple statistical measures or norms without arbitrary weights and with straightforward physical interpretation have been selected to establish conditions under which environmental data can be regressed under real time conditions namely chi square, relative Chi square and log norm.  The principles of feedback have been appli ed to a variety of controlled tracer experiments involving 1 hour mean air concentration. Feedback of environmental survey data can be applied in most noncomplex situations considering an adapted sampling scheme. An independent variation of model parameters using the relative chi square norm can fulfill the basic requirements. To reduce computer time a simple analytical (eg gaussian like) model is to be preferred. The sampling must be performed on several rings at several distances from the source. The samples must be within 2 to 3 delta y values from the ground level plume axis projection, rejecting a nongaussian background. A real time graphical output on video display can be very valuable. An inherent uncertainty factor, especially for the wind direction, has always to be considered. The effective plume height and the source term will have to be found from monitoring data and from the spatial variation of the glc. Finally, it is believed that as long as an accidental situation remains simple enough feed-back will be a very valuable tool, although without being a universal panacea to resolve all unknowns in the early investigation phase.  A generic methodology to define emergency response scenarios has been developed. This method should be implemented in an organised way on a personal computer (PC) and illustrated by a set of examples.  The definition of an emergency response scenario requires: an analysis of the emergency preparedness organisation; the description of the nature and severity of potential releases; an analysis of the emergency decision logics.  The basic structure of the organisation for which scenarios will be prepared comprises 2 coordination units the implant coordination unit for which the nuclear facility operator is responsible and the offsite coordination unit for which offsite authorities are responsible. The scenario has to provide the necessary input information for the implant coordination unit.  The functions to be tested are as follows: communications; activation of emergency organisation (notification); gathering of information; evaluation of accidents; implementation of actions (countermeasurements involving) corrective/mitigatory actions, protective actions, aid to affected persons, radiological survey in the environment and information to the public, authorities, neighbouring countries, international organisation.  The following elements defining the scenario, have to be assessed in accordance with the requirements for the testing of the functions concerned: the type of the nuclear facility; the type of incident; the meteorological situation in function of time; demographic characteristics; results of the radiological survey in function of time at specific reference points in the environment.  The requirements for the functions concerned to be generated may be more of less stringent for the selection of the accident scenario. Some functions (eg communications) so not require a specific scenario in order to be generated. Other functions require only a threshold on released quantities or on individual doses to be exceeded or a specific type of inc ident to have occurred. Still other functions require a more detailed scenario (eg individual doses situated between upper and lower bounds at certain places and with a certain distribution in time). Finally the elements are determined for the implementation of protective measures for the public in the early phase of an accident. The ultimate criterion for the decision on those measures is the individual dose. The decision making can be schematised through a so called decision tree. Decision trees or protective measures for the public (early phase) have been developed for 2 cases (the release has not yet started or is already ended). 3 basic principles are applied: for a certain countermeasure to be imposed, a specific reference level (threshold) of individual dose has to be exceeded; with less drastic countermeasures the individual dose remains higher than this reference level; the imposition of the countermeasure has to bring about a sufficiently high benefit (=decrease of individual dose).  In view of a decision logic tree, the elements of the scenario can be determined in accordance with the countermeasure intended. As will be observed, a certain degree of freedom remains, depending on the action envisaged. It is possible to make use of this when several functions have to be tested simultaneously. The methodology foresees a first approach with a limited number of standard release scenarios and meteorological conditions. In this way the order of magnitude and the kind of meteorological sequence needed to reach the objectives of the exercise can be defined. In a second phase the elements of the scenario are to be refined.  The incorporation of an environmental survey monitoring data feedback module in the comprehensive decision support system for nuclear emergencies in Europe has been discussed. The main conclusions were as follows. An off line module will be developed, with an input output compatability with the main system. The module can be inserted in the system under the control of the user and has to be considered as a tool for the user to explain differences between predictions and observations. It remains up to a user's decision to correct the predictions in the way proposed by the feedback module and to associate weighting factors to the reliability of individual monitoring results. Regarding the complexity of the exercise, a feedback exercise has to be based on a bigaussian atmospheric dispersion model. Eventually it can be organized to confirm, or correct in a first instance, the trajectory of the center of mass of the releases, followed by a correction of source term, height of release and dispersion around the trajectory. Parameters, optimized by the application of an optimization loop to a simple model, can then be introduced in a new assessment applying a more complex dispersion model.  The previously developed numerical optimizatiion technique has been demonstrated on the measuring data collected by a set of gamma exposure rate monitors. Alternative methods for handling the differences between predicted and observed environmental data and fuzzy logic and analysis of spatial distribution of predicted to observed ratios. These are being considered in the decision on the approach to be used in the European decision support system under development. PROJECT 1 : THIS DOSE ASSESSMENT MODEL HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN EXTENSION OF THE EXISTING MODELS AT CEN/SCK. A SPECIFIC RESEARCH AREA IS THE COUPLING OF A DOSE ASSESSMENT MODULE TO A TRI-GAUSSIAN ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION PUFF-MODEL.   THE DOSE ASSESSMENT WILL CONSIDER NUCLIDES AND EXPOSURE PATHWAYS, RELEVANT FOR DECISION MAKING DURING THE EARLY EMERGENCY RESPONSE PHASE, IN CASE OF A SEVERE ACCIDENT AS CONSIDERED BY THE CURRENT PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT STUDIES. AS SELECTION CRITERIUM IS SUGGESTED TO CONSIDER EACH NUCLIDE WHICH CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN 1% TO EARLY DOSES DUE TO CLOUD EXPOSURE, INHALATION AND EXTERNAL IRRADIATION OF DEPOSITS.   THE SYSTEM WILL ALLOW TIME VARIANT SOURCE TERMS AND CONSIDER DRY AND WET DEPOSITION AND RADIOACTIVE DECAY.

THE CONTRACTOR WILL DESCRIBE THE MODEL AND SHOW ITS OPERATIONALITY IN NON-COMPLEX TERRAIN FOR DISTANCES UP TO 20 KM BY APPLICATION TO SOME SCENARIOS, SELECTED REGARDING THE OUTCOMES OF THE PRESENT RESEARCH ON SOURCE TERMS AND CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENT.   PROJECT 2 : THE STUDY WILL STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF UPDATING SOME INPUT PARAMETERS TO THE DOSE ASSESSMENT MODEL BY COMPARISON OF ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY RESULTS TO THE CORRESPONDING VALUES PREDICTED BY THE MODEL.   DURING THE EARLY PHASE OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE SUBSEQUENT OR DURING A SEVERE RELEASE, SOME IMPORTANT INPUT PARAMETERS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MODEL CAN BE RATHER UNCERTAIN CONSIDERING THEIR SENSITIVITY TO THE MODEL OUTPUT. THOSE PARAMETERS CONCERN SOME SOURCE TERM PARAMETERS (E.G. RELEASE RATES, ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION, HEAT CONTENT OF THE PLUME,...), SOME METEOROLOGICAL DATA (E.G. WIND DIRECTION, WIND SPEED,... AT THE POINT OF RELEASE), AND SOME ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSFER PARAMETERS 'E.G. DRY DEPOSITION VELOCITY, WASH-OUT-RATE,...). THE PROJECT AIMS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY TO USE SOME ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY RESULTS TO ADJUST THE FIRST ESTIMATE VALUE OF THOSE PARAMETERS.   THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM DEPENDS ON WHETHER A LIMITED NUMBER OF WELL SELECTED FIELD-OBSERVATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF MODEL PREDICTIONS AVOIDING CONFUSING OSCILLATIONS OF THE SUCCESSIVELY CALCULATED DOSE.

The focus will be on European sensitive regions, particularly those in accession countries, since accession poses significant questions for policy makers regarding the socio-economic and environmental effect of existing and proposed land use policies. SIAT will utilise the statistical and spatial data continuously collected by European and regional agencies. SENSOR will deliver novel solutions for integrated modelling, spatial and temporal scaling and aggregation of data, selection of indicators, database management, analysis and prediction of trends, education and implementation. SIAT will be made available to decision makers at the European and regional level, providing user-friendly interfaces and scientifically sound procedures for the assessment of environmental and monetary responses of policy options. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of policy implementation will be an integral part of the SIAT's functions.",0,0
300,217326,Yes,Restoring competitiveness – Information system for the 21st Century Manufacturing,"PPROI is a revolutionary information system supporting lean management of manufacturing processes by providing users within the firm (from planners to senior executives) with real-time data on capital employed in every process or product in order to increase its manufacturing productivity, overall operational effectiveness, and return on capital. No other system at the market today can supply this kind of detailed information. Commercializing the PPROI IS within EU can have significant economic and social impacts derived from increasing competitiveness of PPROI users mainly through employment retention and employment gains in areas in which European companies – for cost reason - could not compete and where 1.3 mil jobs and European prosperity are at risk.  The proposed project is a strategic initiative for growth and transformation of the company from a small innovation-driven entity, to a market-oriented SME with scale-up business model based on a network of implementation partners. The specific aim of the Phase 1 is to check the feasibility of scaling-up the PPROI concept for a broad commercialization, to be realized e.g. by the SME Instrument Phase 2 funding. The feasibility study will have three components: 1. comprehensive business plan providing a blueprint for business expansion in the CEE region 2 Detailed evaluation of alternative “go-to-market” approaches, including IP protection implications. 3. Designing and testing the technological platform to enhance scalability. The company has already signed long-term service contract with four customers (two subsidiaries of large MNCs, two local SME), reaching TRL 6, and the next stage of company development is focused on business expansion first within the region and then within EU. It aims to reach turnover of 3,6 million EUR by the end of 2020 focusing on two industrial sectors critical to Europe’s competitiveness – automotive and electronics.",1,1
636,41938,No,Evaluation of the Biosafety of lead substitutes Used in the Manufacture of Unleaded Crystal Glass,"Currently crystal glass contains either 24% or 32% lead. In use, lead may leach from crystal into liquids which may be subsequently drunk, resulting in lead intake by the general public. This intake is regarded as unacceptable by groups in some countries (e.g. USA) and therefore there is pressure to remove lead from crystal and replace it with G safer substitute. Whilst a lot is known about lead toxicity, relatively little is known the bioavailability, toxicity and behaviour of substitutes in the body The aim of the project is to provide the European Crystal Industry with the biological information for the production of a safety case for genetic unleaded crystal compositions.",0,0

683,223299,No,Polarization and its discontents: does rising economic inequality undermine the foundations of liberal societies?,"The project will examine the relationship between economic inequality and societal openness, one of the foundational elements of liberal society. Specifically, the project will provide new empirical evidence on the purportedly negative relationship between inequality and social mobility, support for democracy, and social cohesion in the West. The challenge addressed by the project is foremost empirical: for each dimension of openness, there are straightforward theoretical arguments to link rising inequality with declining openness. In each case, there is widely-known evidence to support a negative relationship in bivariate cross-sectional cross-country data. In each case, however, the best available research has regularly failed to confirm the negative relationships in longitudinal designs that sought to identify the causal impact from within-country changes in inequality. To possibly reconcile the discrepancies, the project will create four new multilevel databases that combine survey microdata across more than 30 countries and over observation windows possibly extending back to the 1970s to gain leverage for an encompassing and stringently longitudinal empirical analysis. The newly constructed databases will be used for a detailed decomposition of inequality trends, a disaggregated description of trends in social mobility, social cohesion and support for democratic governance, and for a differentiated causal analysis of the role of economic inequality for societal openness in the West. The latter rests on suitable multilevel regression specifications that distinguish between mechanical, power- and composition-dependent mechanisms and that involve temporal lags, effect thresholds, systematic treatment effect heterogeneity, and appropriate controls for concomitant trends in order to provide valid effect estimates, but also to contextualize effect occurrence and to possibly identify societal and institutional sources of resilience.",0,0
835,227074,No,Responsible sharing: Paving the path for transparent trust,"The collaborative economy is estimated to add €160-€572 billion to the EU economy. Faced with blurry definitions in this emerging market, regulators use a top-down approach and introduce regulations that often fail to consider users’ behaviour. Although considerable knowledge on top-down regulatory solutions for the collaborative economy is accumulating, little is known about the bottom-up psychological factors driving the collaborative economy users’ behaviour. Online platforms rely and promote trust between users and service providers. For responsible sharing, however, trust is necessary but not sufficient. Only when trust is encouraged transparently can users share responsibly. TRUSTPATH will assess, if: (1) users are aware of, or motivated to learn about, the side effects of trade; (2) platforms’ promotion of trust increases users’ information neglect; and (3) transparent environments reduce information neglect and increase responsible sharing. Building on my expertise on trust and cooperation, and using insights from psychology, management, and economics, I will develop and test a novel psychological theory of how people use the collaborative economy: Transparency Based Trust theory (TBT). TBT’s novel hypothesis suggests trust encouraged without transparency leads users to neglect the negative side effects trade has on others. TRUSTPATH innovates by developing a novel methodology (the collaborative economy game) and using cutting-edge technologies (large-scale experiments). Support for TBT implies a major step forward in the systematic understanding of the collaborative economy in the social sciences, and the psychological mechanisms underlying users’ behaviour on platforms like Airbnb, Uber, and others. TRUSTPATH will contribute to establish a new field of study: the psychology of the collaborative economy; inform policymakers seeking to regulate the collaborative economy; and inform companies seeking to promote responsible sharing among users.",1,0
709,103678,No,"Land Use Change, Environment and Society: a integrated framework for economic assessment","This highly interdisciplinary research project examines one of the most fundamental problems in natural resource and environmental economics: the optimal use of land. Land management raises major trade-offs between public and private interests. Agriculture provides the paramount illustration of these trade-offs. Ownership belongs to the private sector, but has significant implications for the society, generating external costs, (such as changes in wildlife habitats and deforestation), as well as external benefits (like the provision of recreational opportunities and the storage of greenhouse gases, GHG).  The central objective of this research is to develop an integrated framework for the economic analysis of decisions concerning agriculture, land use change and associated environmental impacts. It will be based on a novel methodology for economic analyses, including joint models of: a) agricultural production, land use and incomes; b) GHG emissions and c) open-access recreation demand and values. These econometric models will be integrated in a spatially-explicit framework which will encompass both private and social values arising from agricultural land use change. The approach will be demonstrated via policy-relevant scenarios, generated as changes in the main determinants of land use, including market, policy and environmental drivers.  The project will contribute to the objectives of the FP7 People Programme by: 1) producing innovative and interdisciplinary research with high policy-relevance, which will be effectively disseminated with a series of outreach activities; 2) allowing the fellow to gain new skills and additional training in advanced econometrics and environmental economics and become one of the EU leading experts in a fast-growing field of research; and 3) establishing a long-term collaboration between two centres of excellence such as UCSD (San Diego, USA) and UEA (Norwich, UK) enhancing the European quality of research.",1,0
233,32301,Yes,Working Group on Model Based Predictive Control,"To maintain the competitive edge of European industry it is essential that manufacturing should maximise its quality and productivity. For most processes this means that Advanced Control should be used which integrates quality assurance and economic efficiency. Model Based Predictive Control - MBPC - has been shown in many real systems to provide such integration and can often give a pay-back time on capital expenditure of less than a year. A sustained campaign to spread the benefits of MBPC will be of great significance to our industries. The objective of this working group is therefore to help industrial companies to have a better grasp of their processes (performance and safety). Many vendors and end-users are not yet familiar with Advanced Control in the continuous field. They have needs but do not know precisely whether MBPC can be applied to their own processes with reasonable chances of success and a significant expected benefit. They look for information, training and a network of experts or advisors. Many academic institutions are still improving MBPC control methodologies and working on new approaches. They have potential capabilities but need to be re-focused or centred on actual topics coming from real problems. Research topics of a certain level of genericity with a true scientific significance are to be considered, excluding too specific limited actions relevant to classical engineering activities. Thus, the impact of CIDIC on industry will result out of these two convergent needs. This Group's activities aim at making potential users aware of the available technology and its advantages and implications of its use and in turn to enable the feed-back of the industrial experience and unsatisfied needs into research. This will be achieved through seminars and technical training courses.",1,1

65,96863,Yes,Enhancing European Competitiveness by Leveraging Highly Skilled Indian Professionals,"Abstract Due an aging demographic profile, low labour mobility and a mismatch between education and labour market demand, it is has been argued that the EU region will face a scarcity of highly skilled talent in the near future. Many EU member states recognize that maintaining and increasing their present high level of economic wealth and international competitiveness will require that this scarcity is addressed. The Netherlands and Germany have ongoing programmes to attract talent from countries with high availability of skilled human resources. India is a prime focus for both these countries seeking to attract ‘knowledge migrants’.  The project Nyenrode Business University (Netherlands) Kienbaum (Germany) and The Executive Consulting Group (Netherlands) have joined hands to conduct an extensive research study on “Enhancing European Competitiveness by Leveraging Highly Skilled Indian Professionals” over the period of 4 years. The research study will focus on investigating Indian professionals and strategies to attract them; investigating expectations of Indian professionals towards the employment relationship with EU organizations (the “psychological contract approach” to the employment relationship forms the theoretical framework of this topic) and translating research findings into policies and instruments and disseminating knowledge to industry  The innovative character of the study is in the production of scientific knowledge with reference to Indian highly-skilled professionals and to quantify the possible benefits of Indian talent for the European Union. The translation of the scientific knowledge into managerial implications, policies and tools will provide a significant practical contribution to European industry.  Industry-Academic partnership Through the partnership, all three partners will interact extensively and share their knowledge and experience on this subject. Nyenrode will be responsible for the core academic activities in the research.",1,1
1005,201384,No,A novel approach for detecting polygenic adaptation applied to FORest tree candidate GEne NETworks,"Unravelling the mechanisms of selection that allow species to adapt to changing environments has been a perpetual goal of evolutionary genetics. A current paradigm shift seems to radically change our view regarding the major mechanisms of evolutionary change. Ample experimental data indicates that most traits that potentially play a role in adaptations are controlled by many genes that may not act independently, but as members of complex gene interaction networks. Thus, it is widely agreed that most adaptation events in natural populations are reached via so-called polygenic adaptation, involving small changes at multiple genes at a time. Nevertheless, methods are still lacking to detect such adaptive gene associations. The main objective of FORGENET is to propose NetAdapt, a network-based test of polygenic selection for candidate-gene data. NetAdapt exploits candidate-gene data both as genotype and functional genomic data. First, based on the functional genomic information inherent to candidate gene data, it proposes to construct a gene interaction network, whose topology can be used to define a null hypothesis of neutrality. Second, based on the genotype data, it proposes a test for detecting selection on gene interactions, i.e. epistatic selection, based on linkage disequilibrium statistics. NetAdapt is expected to enhance our understanding how selection acts on gene networks and to propose new candidate genes for future genotyping. NetAdapt will be applied to published data on coniferous forest trees that have been genotyped from haploid tissue, which offers a straightforward application. Many conifers are endangered by climate change and estimating their adaptability is an important European research priority. FORGENET will study the evolution of flowering time genes at spruces along latitudinal gradients, and drought tolerance in Mediterranean pine species.",0,0
1000,103009,No,Researching Consumer Perceived Ethicality (CPE) of Companies and Brands,"Issues such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics have increasingly taken centre stage in today’s society. While researchers agree that consumers react negatively/positively to companies they perceive as un/ethical, the actual question of what evokes such a negative or positive perception has not been investigated. To this day, little is known about how moral equity is generated and emerges in the consumer’s mind. This research shall redress this research imbalance. In order to better understand the link between un/ethical corporate conduct and consumer responses, the question of how ethical perceptions are formed and affected by corporate behaviour is of utmost importance. The planned research hopes to facilitate much-needed theory building and deeper insight into consumer reactions to corporate ethics, CSR, or corporate reputation efforts. Any subsequent research investigating notions of company and brand misconduct, scandal spillover effects, or, more generally, any facets of ethical consumption will benefit from this conceptualisation. The host institution (ESMT) was one of the very first schools in Germany to introduce a chair in Corporate Social Responsibility (held by the scientist in charge) and is therefore an ideal fit with the applicant’s work. With links to the Social Science, specifically Social Psychology, the project will be multi-disciplinary by nature. In addition to the acquisition of new conceptual knowledge, the project promises to considerably expand the applicant’s methodological and analytical skillset. Joining ESMT would allow the applicant to build a strong research network and by so doing enables growth and maturity as a scientific researcher. Given the high relevance of the research topic as well as ESMT’s close ties with the industry sector, the project presented hereafter has strong potential for dissemination among academics and business managers alike, whereby raising the profile of European academic research.",1,0

Innovation is a key driver for the success of enterprises, a requirement for their competiveness and thus a precondition for exploiting international opportunities in the Single Market and beyond. Offering growth-oriented business and innovation support services to SMEs is therefore seen as the core task of the Enterprise Europe Network. Although Innovation Management is crucial for SMEs, empiric data has proven that SMEs still show the inability to manage innovation processes efficiently and effectively as the second most important barrier to SME innovation. Enterprise Europe Network Bremen will offer the services to ensure that SME beneficiaries of H2020 European Innovation Council (EIC) Pilot are able to exploit their full Innovation potential. Therefore services are designed and offered to enhance the innovation management capacities of SMEs as an integral part of the hub and spokes approach of the Enterprise Europe Networks Services, addressing the innovation needs of SME’s to establish an Innovation Management System (basis: technical specification CEN/TS-16555-1 , published by the European Commission) in the respective enterprises.",1,1
86,214604,Yes,Direct Empirical Evidence on Labor Market Search Theories,"Our project proposes to provide new empirical evidence on the search strategies of both job seekers and of recruiters in the labor market. This evidence will enhance our understanding of the information asymmetries at the root of search frictions.  We will leverage the extraordinary opportunities offered by online job boards, which record search activities in details. We will match for the first time these data with administrative data from unemployment-employment registers. This will enable us to jointly observe search activity and core economic outcomes (wage, job duration) on very large samples.  We will design randomized controlled trials, where we recommend new matches to both job seekers and recruiters. This will test for the extent of geographical and skill mismatch in the labor market. We will further test the assumptions of directed search models by displaying to job seekers the real-time length of the queue in front of vacancies. Finally, we will use new item-to-item collaborative filtering algorithms (amazon-type recommendations) to quantify the social value of the private information that job seekers gather when they screen vacancies.  Using quasi-experimental research designs, we will provide the first precise estimates of the direct and cross effects of search subsidies - unemployment insurance and reduction in vacancy advertising costs - on the search strategies of both sides of the market. We will then test the empirical relevance of behavioral mechanisms, such as reference-dependence or over-optimism.  We expect our direct empirical evidence on search strategies to trigger new developments in search theories. Our results will guide policy-makers who design job boards and search subsidies to both recruiters and job seekers. We hope that the social impact of our research will be to reduce frictional unemployment and to increase the productivity of workers through a reduction of mismatch in the labor market.",1,1

The main objective of the ResCoM project is to develop an innovative framework and a collaborative software platform for the industrial implementation of closed-loop manufacturing systems.  In ResCoM, four manufacturers who are active in B2B and B2C markets (Gorenje, tedrive, Bugaboo and Loewe) will pilot a closed loop product system in their businesses. These pilots will demonstrate how the collecting, remanufacturing and upcycling of discarded products into new added-value products will be cost-effective, resource-efficient and more sustainable than the current linear manufacturing systems.  To support the pilot development, the ResCoM consortium will develop a framework based on methodologies and tools that take in account the complex, dynamic interation between product design (design for multiple product lifecycles), supply chain management (integrated supply chains), business model development (closed-loop business models) and remanufacturing processes .  To support the pilot operations, the ResCoM consortium will develop a software platform consisting of a closed-loop product lifecycle management module coupled with a materials information module. The platform will help guide design decisions by illustrating the benefits of closed loop product design in terms of resource efficiency, CO2 production and energy use, and will provide business metrics such as lifecycle cost estimates, rapid identification of critical materials, product specific and remanufacturing considerations and legislative requirements. The platform will be tested and evaluated by the manufacturers.  The ResCoM project results will be useful within a wide range of businesses and will equip industries and policy-makers with the tools required to support the transition to a closed-loop model.",0,0
716,38166,No,Biomonitoring of nitroarenes in Chinese workers,"Research in the field of molecular toxicology has been exponentially growing in the last few years. Several studies have been undertaken to associate disease to chemical exposure. The association has been found only for a few compounds. Therefore, investigations of highly exposed workers are needed, which include the state of the art techniques in the field of molecular toxicology. This will improve the predictive value of the measured parameters. Expected Outcome  Individuals from China will be trained to assess the work environment, and to analyze exposure enabling them to implement an occupational hygiene regime. Workers in Chinese chemical industries are exposed to high concentrations of arylamines and nitroarenes. These compounds cause major occupational health problems. The aim of the present study is to investigate a large cohort of exposed workers to 2-nitrotoluene, 4-nitrotoluene and 4-chloronitrobenzene in a dye factory in Dalian (Province of Liaoning, China). The major adverse health effects among 600 workers are hepatomegaly (40-60 cases), neurasthenia, and splenomegaly. In addition, a cohort of TNT workers in Fuxin City in the Province of Liaoning, will be studied. High incidences of cataract have been registered among these workers. The workers will be identified as high, intermediate and low exposure groups, and a group of matched referents will also be included. Thirty workers per group and compound will be studied. Air levels, urine metabolites, albumin and hemoglobin adducts, DNA adducts from exfoliated urothelial bladder cells and chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes will be determined. The obtained values will be correlated to the health status of the workers and to the epidemiological data at the work site. In addition, individual susceptibility of the workers will be studied by genotyping the known polymorphic enzymes involved in the detoxification of the nitroarenes. The levels of biomarkers found in the workers will be compared with levels measured in non-exposed groups. To establish an acceptable level of exposure to the above mentioned chemicals the following parameters will be measured:  External dose (air measurements); internal dose (urine metabolites); biological effective dose (blood proteins, DNA adducts in exfoliated urothelial bladder cells); biological effects (chromosomal aberrations); and individual susceptibility genotypes (glutathione S-transferase M1, glutathione S-transferase T1, N-acetyltransferase 2 and N-acetyltransferase 1).  Health monitoring of the exposed people will be carried out by occupational physicians. They will assess, a) disease related to the exposures such as aplastic anemia, toxic hepatitis, and cataracts, and b) frequency of non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, headache etc.",0,0
462,220805,No,Enteric-nervous-system-mediated regulation of intestinal inflammation,"Environmental and internal stimuli are constantly sensed by the body’s two large sensory units, the nervous system and the immune system. Integration of these sensory signals and translation into effector responses are essential for maintaining body homeostasis. While some of the intrinsic pathways of the immune or nervous system have been investigated, how the two sensory interfaces coordinate their responses remains elusive. We have recently investigated neuro-immune interaction at the mucosa of the intestine, which is densely innervated by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Our research has exposed a previously unrecognized pathway used by enteric neurons to shape type 2 immunity at mucosal barriers. Cholinergic enteric neurons produce the neuropeptide Neuromedin U (NMU) to elicit potent activation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) via Neuromedin U receptor 1, selectively expressed by ILC2s. Interestingly, NMU stimulated protective immunity against the parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis but also triggered allergic lung inflammation. Therefore, the NMU-NMUR1 axis provides an excellent opportunity to study how neurons and immune cells interact to regulate immune responses and maintain body homeostasis. We propose to generate and use elegant genetic tools, which will allow us to systematically investigate the consequences of neuro-immune crosstalk at mucosal surfaces in various disease models. These tools will enable us to selectively measure and interfere with neuronal and ILC2 gene expression and function, thereby leading to an unprecedented understanding of how the components of neuro-immune crosstalk contribute to parasite immunity or allergic disease development. Furthermore, we will progress into translational aspects of NMU-regulated immune activation for human immunology. Therefore, our research has the potential to develop basic concepts of mucosal immune regulation and such discoveries could also be harnessed for therapeutic intervention.",0,0
542,59628,No,Regional Governance - New Modes of Self-Government in the European Community,"The proposed conference is intended to help to improve the self-governing capacity of regions. Regional governance is defined as weak forms of regional steering modes based on networks, conventions, norms and contracts. Modes of regional governance have developed during the last years in reaction to structural adjustment processes on the level of regions. Regional governance gains growing importance as the European Community and its Member States are endeavouring to boost the regions as societal levels of self-governance. However, that kind of self-government is embedded and dependent on existing cultural as well as institutional framework conditions. To discuss this the international and interdisciplinaire EuroConference 'Regional Governance - New Modes of Self-Government in the European Community' is planned in February 2001 in Hannover. The objective of the conference will be twofold: first, to clearer envisage what different forms regional governance may have in different contexts, how the process of European integration also works in favour of regional governance and, finally, how regional governance could be shaped in order to make regions more competetive actors in a globalised world. The second objective will be to induce international networks of researchers who should elaborate topics in need of further research during the conference. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-2000-00357-1.pdf",0,0

Output Indicators and Impact  Output a) See deliverables listed above; b) No of high-quality publications: the target is to publish 6 ESTO&IPTS Technical Reports and 10 issues of the IPTS Report:  2- Impact ESTO network activities are -and will be- mainly direct linked to EU RTD Policy development (including Commission strategic priorities 2001-2006 and legislation). Summary of the project  There are 3 tasks under development for the duration of the 5th Framework Programme, included within the description of this project. These are:  (a) European Science & Technology Observatory Network (ESTO) management The ESTO network (http://esto.jrc.es/) presently consists of 45 organizations that supply IPTS with up-to-date information and analysis drawn from all over the world as well as assists, informs and alerts on scientific or technological developments which may have an important socio-economic impact and potential relevance for the EU policies. Its core competence resides in prospective analysis and advice on S&T changes relevant to EU society, economy and policy;  (b) The IPTS Report The IPTS' monthly journal, The IPTS Report, is produced in English, French, German and Spanish, and in co-operation with ESTO Network - Internet (http://www.jrc.es/iptsreport). The IPTS Report articles address S/T developments and their implications, deemed prospectively relevant to EU policy-makers. Presently, there are about 6,000 printed issues distributed to subscribers to The IPTS Report. In 2001, there have been on average 40,000 visitors every month who consult the electronic version of the publication through the web site;  (c) Knowledge Management In order to implement its mission, the Institute develops awareness and cross-disciplinary knowledge skills, and build up appropriate contacts for anticipating and following the agenda of the policy decision-makers. The IPTS success is also based on its networking capabilities and the quality of its networks as enabling sources of relevant information.  To be able to develop and maintain adequate in-house knowledge and networking capabilities, the Institute is implementing the following knowledge management activities: 1) identify internal knowledge needs; 2) mapping the IPTS networks/contacts and outdoors scientific excellence/expertise; 3) develop informatics/web tools related to knowledge management.  Each and every one of the scientific support tasks included in this set fulfils a specific objective for which it has been developed. Each task has a specific and well-defined project implementation plan. Since these are support tasks to the IPTS as a whole their deliverables vary according to the specific needs. Reciprocity of working plans and methods with other JRC institutes are pursued and, whenever possible, synergy will be exploited.  Rationale  This is a horizontal project spanning all Institute programme lines. Its largest part, the ESTO Network, has the role to organise a techno-economic intelligence system, which is able to provide, through IPTS, EU institutions with timely advice concerning the development of new technologies, the likelihood of breakthroughs, the social challenges that they pose and their potential impact on policy. This includes monitoring development in the other major industrialized trading blocks to determine what lessons can be learned for anticipating and following the agenda of the policy decision-makers. The IPTS work also benefits from the development of appropriate contacts (networking capabilities), awareness and cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills. As a matter of fact, the other parts of this project facilitate, develop and optimise in different ways both the in-hose knowledge and outdoors sources of information and expertise.",0,0
42,3669,Yes,Economic transformation in Eastern Europe,"The activities of the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPP) summarize the beginnings of a major new research initiative on Eastern Europe and the complex questions of economic reform and system design its governments now face.   The initial workshop covered macroeconomic stabilization and convertibility, the restructuring of industry and trade, fiscal reform, privatization, and financial markets.  Further research workshops have already generated substantial output including discussion papers and a special report on the impact of events in Eastern Europe on the process of integration in Western Europe. These involve work industrial competitiveness, privatization, debt and labour markets.  Several other important research workshops addressed:  industrial restructuring and trade reorientation; taxation and fiscal reforms; on German unification and European integration; employment and productivity policy for German integration; the association agreements between the Community and the Central European countries.   The 1992 CEPR Report on Monitoring European Integration offered an analytical framework for thinking about enlargement of the Community. It covered a wide range of monetary, trade and political economy issues. Its approach and solid research base was a welcome counterweight to those who argue for or against enlargement on the basis of preconceived views of the Community's future.   A set of studies have been undertaken for the Commission's Forward Studies Unit evaluating the economic transformation of the Central European countries in its social and political context. The output is intended to inform the Community's dealings with the 'Visegrad 3' countries in implementing the Europe Agreements.   Some of the research which has already been presented in academic conferences addressed:  the transition in Hungary;  the economic consequences of the East;  the role of the financial system in economic growth and development;  finance and development in Europe.",1,1
587,227815,No,Development and implementation of reduced density matrix functionals for relativistic quantum chemistry.,"Computational chemistry (CC) methods supply approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation (SE) and make it possible to compute a wide range of chemical properties. A problem is, however, that the work horse method in CC,  Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory, cannot always describe the process of chemical bonds breaking or formation accurately (the errors produced in H2 dissociation are a simple example). Wave function-based methods are more reliable but their computational cost is prohibitive for large systems. Recent advances in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) have demonstrated the potential of this methodology to treat such non-dynamic electron correlation effects (near degeneracies occurring in bond dissociation) at reasonable computational cost. In this project I aim to explore RDMFT in an area in which a proper treatment of non-dynamic electron correlation effects is essential: the chemistry of heavy elements. For compounds of such elements, near-degeneracies of electronic energies is the rule rather than the exception, and RDFMT emerges as an excellent alternative in relativistic CC to wave function based and DFT methods . An important complication is the importance of relativistic effects requiring the use of the Dirac equation (DE) instead of the SE. In this project, I will work on transferring  RDMFT to this domain by taking the following steps: a) set up the required theoretical background, b) analyze the performance of the currently available RDMFT approximations (for two-component Hamiltonians), c) develop a RDMFT approximation for the DE (four-component Hamiltonian), and d) make this methodology available to the scientific community by implementing it in the DIRAC code. I expect that RDMFT will predict energies accurately for the DE, and it can become a powerful method to predict properties of novel materials formed by heavy elements.",0,0
30,210201,Yes,Innovation services and key account management support for Basque SMEs during 2017-2018,"SMEs are the backbone of Europe's economy. They represent 99% of all businesses in the EU. In the past five years, they have created around 85% of new jobs and provided two-thirds of the total private sector employment in the EU. It is important to note that while the prospects for SME success are tied with macro-economic developments, they by no means identically mirror all of them. As the majority of SMEs operate in sectors that serve domestic demand, for example, they did not share in the benefits of increased foreign demand, which was the key macro-economic driver of growth from 2008 to 2015. This has been also the case of Basque SMEs during the same period. Many SMEs are not in export‐oriented sectors, particularly the micro and small enterprises. Thus, programs supporting SME exports benefit directly only a sub‐set of SMEs. However, indirectly, all SMEs benefit to some extent from growth in exports as higher exports raises a) overall income levels, and hence the demand for goods and services sold by domestic demand facing SMEs, and b) the demand for goods and services originating from exporting‐oriented enterprises. Yet in an increasingly internationalized world, there are competitive advantages for those businesses that begin with a global strategy and can move quickly to take advantage of cross‐border activities.  Providing further, tailored support for this growing asset class would form a key step in allowing SMEs to leverage the benefits of increased foreign demand. In the Basque Country we’re very much aware of this scenario and that’s why the Network consortium partners participating in this action have design a implementation plan aiming at contributing to the objectives of COSME and H2020. That is, facilitating access to European and international markets for Basque SMEs and by providing growth-oriented, integrated business and innovation support services that help strengthen the competitiveness and sustainability of the enterprises in our region.",1,1
3,209506,Yes,Establishing services enhancing the innovation management capacity of SME's in the Enterprise Europe Network,"Main task is to establish the services “Enhancing the innovation  management capacity of SMEs” within the Enterprise Europe Network with the intention to enhance SME’s potential in a successful result of their participation in The SME instruments project and to assist particularly promising SMEs in enhancing their innovation management capacities. The services are aimed at SMEs in Iceland with a great potential for international growth, but lack knowledge, skills or ability to manage innovation activities. Highly qualified staff of Enterprise Europe Network at the Innovation Center Iceland possesses the skills required and in-depth  knowledge of the support required to enable companies to reach their potential.",1,1
299,42426,Yes,The governance of cross-border regional economic co-operation and the emergence of European cross-border regions - theory and empirical evidence,"Research objectives and content  Cross-border regions are a new form of subnational territorial unit, emerging in the context of European integration and globalisation. This project aims to undertake an original analysis of CBRs as spaces of indigenous economic development. Its primary objectives are: a) developing an appropriate conceptual apparatus; b) identifying the institutional conditions for and the obstacles to successful CBRs; c) generating policy-guidelines for cross-border endogenous development strategies. The elaboration of the theoretical approach is based on recent institutionalist theories which emphasise the importance of bottom-up governance mechanisms rather than top-down government. Since CBRs are not politico-administrative units, it is postulated that crossborder economic development is mainly based on governance leading to similar milieu innovateur-effects as shown for subnational regions. This will be demonstrated by several in-depth case studies on European CBRs including both successful and failed cases, which will provide guidelines for a bottom-up regional and innovation policy both at the European and cross-border regional levels.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  ? The project is directed towards a PhD degree and is accompanied by a recognised research training scheme.  ? Leading knowledge in institutional economics and economic sociology will be acquired as well as methodological skills for operationalising institutional processes for empirical research. ? General research competence will be enhanced through academic 'synergy effects' including working groups, informal contacts and opportunities for publications. The project will function as a foundation for a research career.",1,1
356,78677,Yes,"Inequality: Mechanisms, Effects and Policies","The INEQ project has three objectives: a. investigate, against the background of the global economy and the North-South relationships, the economic and social mechanisms that are producing inequality within European countries and in the European Union as a hole and make for its persistence; b. investigate the effects inequality has on economic performance and social integration in Europe; c. identify actual and possible policies at the national and EU levels. As to wage inequality, three key economic mechanisms will be studied, with a focus on EU countries and on a group of developing/neighbouring countries: technological change; global trade and FDI; finance.  They will be integrated into a general economic modelling for EU countries that may allow to compare their relative importance and to simulate the impact of different policies. As to market income inequality in Europe account will be taken of non-wage income, of households composition and employment. Finally the re-distributive role of Welfare states will allow investigating the dynamics of disposable income. Considering social processes, the gender, inter-generational and ethnic/immigrant factors leading to social polarisation and inequality will be addressed in the case of EU countries; at the global level, the social dynamics reacting to inequalities will be investigated focusing on the activities of non state actors and on collective mobilisations challenging current policies.  In terms of policy, a variety of economic (taxation, expenditure, welfare reform, etc.) and social (on gender, immigrant, social rights) policies that affect inequality within Europe will be analysed, showing how public decision making contributes or restrains the inequality mechanisms and their effects. A set of blueprints will be prepared with detailed recommendations on how national and EU policies could contribute to reduce inequalities, both within Europe and, for their part, at the global level.",1,1
403,200687,No,Comparative Analysis of Social Spaces in Post-Industrial Nations,"The proposed research has two overarching objectives. First, it aims to examine whether it is possible and appropriate to extend a novel way of measuring social class recently devised for the United Kingdom to other post-industrial nations for the purposes of cross-national comparative research. If it is, the project will begin to explore, through secondary and primary analysis of large-scale survey data, the different shapes and trajectories of the class structures – or ‘social spaces’ – of various nation states. This will involve examination of which classes and sub-classes predominate and which have emerged or declined, as well as the different gender and ethnic/nationality constitutions of the classes and the distinct effects these differences have for understanding cultural and political struggles and, ultimately, the distribution of power or ‘recognition’ in each country. Second, the project aims to explore, through both statistical analysis and qualitative interviews, how social class is actually lived, experienced and balanced against other pressures and sources of recognition in everyday life, with a focus on three specific nations: the United States, Germany and Sweden. Of particular interest in this respect is the balancing of desire for recognition through money and education – the two cornerstones of social class in post-industrial capitalist societies – and their associated lifestyles with desires for recognition and love within the family. The comparative analysis included in both research aims will be guided by the hypothesis that national differences depend on the nature of the welfare regime in operation, especially as it relates to the nature and extent of workforce feminisation, though the research will also be alive to the possibility of alternative – or no significant – sources of contrast.",1,0
172,38940,Yes,SME policy and the regional dimension of innovation,"The main objective of the project is to analyse what characterises best practice innovation policy aiming at SMEs in different kinds of regions and sectors. This is done by comparative evaluation of existing programmes and policies to promote innovation in SMEs in different regions in seven European countries. A wide mix of regions and policy instruments is covered in the project. The different evaluations have the same theoretical background and main questions, and the evaluations include thorough examinations of effects at firm level.   The research will be based on new theoretical understanding of the innovation process, specified in the interactive innovation model, which points to new options for SMEs in innovation performance, and new possibilities in designing innovation policy aiming at SMEs.   The policy objectives are:   1. Distinguish a collection of best practice policy, and proposals for innovation policies aiming at SMEs, suited to different kind of regions and different kind of firms.   2. Transfer learning of best practice policy between the policy instruments and regions studied. This includes analyses of the possibilities for copying policy instruments between different geographical levels, e.g. to consider what EU can learn from succesful regional or national initiated instruments.   3. Inform and affect policy makers at regional, national and EU level regarding best practice innovation policy aiming at SMEs in different kind of regions.   The project will add new results to our understanding of innovation policy aiming at SMEs. Of particular importance is the comparative approach, and the use of new understandings in innivation theory in the evaluations.",0,1
814,42363,No,Evolution of plant disease resistance genes,"To analyse the natural variation at a disease resistance gene locus in Arabidopsis. The chromosome 4 locus specifying resistance to the Peronospora parasitica isolate Cala2 will be examined in a large number of host accessions. Resistance genes from two accessions will be sequenced and compared to determine the degree of sequence divergence that occurs between functional alleles. Additionalyy, the corresponding susceptibility loci will be sequenced and compared. Current evidence is that susceptibility is caused by loss of the gene, but non-functional structural homologues could exist in other accessions. The universality of this observation will be tested and the loci sequenced. Analysis of the deleted regions could reveal the cause of this genomic instability. Sequence analysis of non-functional homologues will reveal the structures that are essential for recognition of the Cala2 pathogen isolate. Finally, the project will reveal the current evolutionary state of this gene locus in 100 UK accessions of Arabidopsis and give clues as to its stability in natural plant populations. To become familiar with the techniques involved in the molecular and classical analysis of disease resistance genes. This will envable me to assess strategies for manipulating disease resistance in crop plants. All these skills be useful to me in my future research career in Greece.",0,0

Traditional manufacturing technology, as well as advanced production methods, will be addressed with the aim of mastering the situation in the production environment for standard IC high-volume manufacturing, and for custom or semi-custom ICs with quick turnaround manufacturing requirements. The objective of this project is to develop concepts and to realise practical solutions that will enable efficient and cost effective manufacturing to be carried out with respect to yield, cycle time, flexibility of products and processes, equipment utilisation and labour productivity.  Traditional manufacturing technology, as well as advanced production methods, are addressed with the aim of mastering the situation in the production environment for standard integrated circuit (IC) high volume manufacturing and for custom for semicustom ICs with quick turnaround manufacturing requirements.  The project started with an evaluation and elaboration of the technical specifications of the production factors involved, an investigation of cleanroom techniques and the improvement of the current manufacturing of masks and reticles.  The project focuses on the following 4 topics: equipment engineering; automation and integration; cleanroom technology; mask making.  About 400 individual manufacturing problems for the optimisation of production in the focus topics were successfully addressed. The main objectives were to optimise 1.0 micron processing and define manufacturing requirements for 0.5 micron processes, both of which have been achieved as scheduled. The project focused on the following four topics:   - Equipment Engineering    Equipment selection and cooperation with suppliers, preferably on a European basis. Strategic decision making for new equipment installation, modifications and improvements. In-time acquisition of manufacturing experience on equipment for larger wafer sizes. Investigation of the potential for cost reduction by: design; dimensions and materials of equipment; particle reduction by surface finish; availability improvement by real time process control; self-diagnostics; lot and wafer traceability.   - Automation and Integration    Material flow and management system for high product mix and varying lot sizes.

797,195922,No,Risk and MigrationA Transnational History of Romanian Migration to Western Europe (2002-2013),"The liberalization of border controls following the breakdown of the Europe's communist regimes led to important flows of East-West migration. Western Europeans, fearing a literal invasion of Central and Eastern European immigrants, increasingly interpreted this new-found mobility as being fraught with risk. This research project will examine the history of Romanian migration to France and Italy from 2002 until the end of 2013 from the perspective of risk. It will analyse how evaluations of and responses to risk shape the migration process. The first step of this project will be to understand how fear of migration influences political responses and regulatory measures. The second step will investigate how this sense of fear developed and evolved within French, Italian and Romanian societies. It will also analyse how risk perception impacts migrants’ relationships with the host society. Focussing on the migrants’ own perceptions of their mobility, the third step of the project will examine how they respond to risk. An emphasis will be placed on young adults. The inter-disciplinary perspective adopted in this study will provide a more complete history of Romanian migration during the last decade. Drawing on empirical research, this study will focus on the connections that could be established between European citizens. The final objective is to demonstrate the relevance of ‘risk’ in understanding the migration process.",0,0

The work will focus on (i) comparison activities to identify the comparative advantages of the models, (ii) the crucial role of stock-flow interactions together with endogenously stimulated technological progress and (iii) the social and institutional dimensions of the transition process. Thus the project activities are expected to provide guidelines, as to which economic structures are able to give support to EU policies that generate economic welfare without creating burdens on social, economic, and environmental resources.",1,0
571,51894,No,Oil and herbicide pollution in the Black Sea : detection and biological impact,"Foreseen Results  The data collected on the pollution in the monitored areas will be correlated with the population distribution and physiological state of benthic/interstitial organisms that represent in this project the response of the biota to pollution induced stress. The biological impact will be studied largely as a cooperative Ukrainian : Israeli effort. The proposed research is focused on the North and North-West sectors of the Black Sea and on the deltas of the three major Black Sea tributaries : Danube, Dnieper, Dniester. 150 sampling stations are planned. Two types of pollutants are selected for monitoring : oils representing industry/transportation of produced pollutants and herbicides representing pollutants originating from the agricultural sector. Potential of total pollutants contained in the water to generate biological damage will be assessed in the laboratory by unspecific, highly sensitive algal bioassay and in the Sea by monitoring response of benthic organisms.  It is proposed to develop novel low-cost techniques for detection of oil and herbicide pollution. The feasibility of the novel techniques will be assessed in the laboratory and subsequently in the field conditions by comparing them with conventional analytical methods. The techniques will be developed as a cooperative effort of Czech and French research teams and of a small Czech business. Testing of the novel techniques will on the cooperation with Ukrainian and Israeli teams. Conventional analytical methods will be used by the Ukrainian proposers to provide standardized information about composition and spatial distribution of the pollutants.  In parallel to the highly specific conventional and novel analytical methods, unspecific bioassays will be used to estimate the biological impact of the pollutants. The bioassay is based on the exposure of highly sensitive algal cultures to the samples of polluted water collected from the monitored areas. The response of the algae will be calibrated in the laboratory conditions by exposure to known concentrations of representative pollutant components. The bioassay will be performed by the Czech team with assistance of Ukrainian and Israeli teams.",0,0
22,185583,Yes,Corroding the social? An empirical evaluation of the relationship between unemployment and social stratification in OECD countries,"'The proposal describes a project to deliver a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between unemployment and social stratification in Europe and North America. The project’s core goal is to provide empirical estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on four critical domains of social life, namely household incomes, demographic behaviour, educational attainment, as well as social integration and civic participation. The analysis will examine the persistence of such effects in the medium and longer run, and will evaluate the role of moderating factors like coupled unemployment and unemployment duration. The distinction between the stratification impacts of household experiences of unemployment and those of aggregate macroeconomic conditions will be a particular focus in the analysis, as will be the evaluation of a mediation model including changing household incomes, changing economic expectations and changing norms and preferences as relevant factors. The project will also address heterogeneity in the effects of unemployment e.g. by level of education, household demographics, household income or social class, and will evaluate the extent of cross-country variation in the impacts of unemployment, as well as any mitigating role of labour market and social policies, along the four dimensions of stratification considered. The empirical analysis rests on cross-nationally harmonized multilevel life course datasets constructed from various representative household panel studies, notably the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and several national panel studies, merged with time-series data on aggregate unemployment at the regional level. To achieve robust causal inference, the project utilizes multilevel panel data modelling, notably two-way fixed-effects and related estimators that statistically control for unobserved heterogeneity at both the household and contextual level.'",1,1
154,89951,Yes,"Monetary, Fiscal and Structural Policies with Heterogeneous Agents","It is almost a commonplace that macroeconomic policies, if well conducted, are a stability-enhancing device. By providing a non-inflationary environment, they “keep in order” the backstage of a movie in which the actors -- firms and households – determine long run growth by means of saving/investment decisions. In this view aggregate outcomes can be improved upon by means of microeconomic or structural policies such as labour and product market deregulation, investment in human capital etc. The scope of macroeconomic policies, however, is much wider. For instance, monetary policy affects business fluctuations and growth through financial factors which are certainly no less important than inflation, as the current sub-prime crisis has emphasized.  POLHIA aims at exploring the role of macroeconomic policies in this wider sense and the nexus of macroeconomic and microeconomic/structural policies in an heterogeneous agents setting. Modern macroeconomic thinking must in fact go beyond the Representative Agent assumption because agents are indeed different -- in terms of real and financial conditions, labour market status, technical capabilities, expectations, market power etc. -- and this heterogeneity is crucial for macroeconomic outcomes. Monetary and fiscal policies affect in different ways different people just as structural policies do. Structural policies, in turn, can have macroeconomic consequences through externalities. Hence macro and micro policies are strictly intertwined: they can reinforce (or interfere with) each other.  The research group will exploit a wide range of tools. At the level of model building the development of macroeconomic frameworks in the New Keynesian tradition will be paralleled and complemented by the extensive use of Agent based models, which are particularly appropriate for the exploration of heterogeneous agents environments. Empirical research will be carried out by means of econometric models and experiments to study, for instance, the formation of expectations.  POLHIA aims at providing new insights and useful suggestions for the implementation of both macroeconomic policies and structural policies and for rethinking policy coordination or coherence, which emerges first between monetary and fiscal policies and second between micro and macro policies. The natural candidates to be beneficiaries of this type of analysis, therefore, are policy makers: first and foremost central bankers and Government officials in charge of fiscal and structural policies.",1,1
719,186986,No,IMPROVING THE SAFETY AND MOBILITY OF VULNERABLE ROAD USERS THROUGH ITS APPLICATIONS,"In the past, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) success has been achieved primarily though equipment of the vehicle and infrastructure. The focus of these ITS has been on clean, safe and efficient mobility for vehicles.  The Vulnerable Road User (VRU) has reaped fewer benefits of the ITS developments. While some projects have considered VRUs from a safety viewpoint, they often aimed to avoid or mitigate accidents with VRUs by equipping the vehicle and infrastructure. In the vehicle – infrastructure – human approach of ITS research, VRUs and their needs are not an active part of the “human” element in the ITS approach.  What is needed? The VRU must become an active, integrated element in the ITS, addressing safety, mobility and travel comfort needs of VRUs. The VRUITS project will develop an architecture for integrating the VRUs into the cooperative ITS.  VRUITS will recommend ITS that meet the needs of VRUs. Ex-ante and ex-post assessments will form input to these recommendations. Assessment methodologies will be modified to account for specific user behaviour of VRUs. Specifications for ITS applications will be developed, culled from focus group assessments per VRU group. VRUITS will recommend best practices to address HMI development for VRUs. Field trials in the Netherlands and Spain for a select number of applications will take place.  VRUITS will recommend which actions for the EC and for other stakeholders are necessary to deploy the systems which have positive effects, and mitigate possible negative effects.  VRUITS will fulfill the following objectives:  1. Assess societal impacts of selected ITS, and provide recommendations for policy and industry regarding ITS in order to improve the safety and mobility of VRUs;  2. Provide evidence-based recommended practices on how VRU can be integrated in Intelligent Transport Systems and on how HMI designs can be adapted to meet the needs of VRUs, and test these recommendations in field trials.",0,0
553,16980,No,Vulnerable Road User Traffic Observation and Optimization,"The work in VRU-TOO is targeted specifically at the reduction of risk and minimization of delay to vulnerable road users, namely pedestrians. To achieve this, the project links implementations with behavioural studies of the micro-level interaction of pedestrians and vehicles. Research is being carried out in order to reduce risk and minimize delay to vulnerable road users, namely pedestrians. The project links detection techniques with behavioural studies of the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles. The implementations take the form of pilot projects in cities in both northern and southern Europe involving the application of advanced detector systems to improve conditions for pedestrians, particularly at signalized junctions and crossings. Behavioural work is being carried out to create detailed rules for the normal (safe) and abnormal (unsafe) interaction of pedestrians and vehicles.  A review has been undertaken of all the existing technologies for detecting pedestrians. Simultaneously, the feasibility phase for all the implementations has been conducted and reports delivered for the Portuguese and Greek sites where the design phase is now under way. In all cases, cooperation with the respective cities is continuing and it is expected that the installations will take place as planned and on time.  The behavioural work has started with the formulation of initial hypotheses and a specification of the variables and data need to formulate the rules on pedestrian car interaction. Collection of the data required for the empirical formulation of a set of rules is complete in the 4 countries concerned. Conflict studies are being coordinated with video observations and the first round of analysis of the data has been carried out. The analysis indicates that at nonsignalized intersections pedestrian behaviour is the main predictor of conflict occurrence, whereas at signalized intersections vehicle factors have the most important role.  The computer modelling work is implementing the pedestrian meso model from V1031 in Portugal. Simultaneously agreement is being reached on the specification of an improved version of the model. Technical Approach   The implementations will take the form of pilot projects in cities in both northern and southern Europe. They will involve the application of advanced detector systems to improve conditions for pedestrians, particularly at signalized junctions and crossings. The northern European implementation will involve the application of these techniques to a large city-centre scheme, where pedestrian needs will conflict with those of vehicle traffic. The systems will be designed in such a way as to obtain the maximum safety and minimum delay for VRUs, with as little inconvenience to motorized traffic as possible. Two smaller implementations will be conducted at urban locations in Portugal and Greece, where once again it is difficult to satisfy both the needs of pedestrians and those of vehicles. This work will verify the applicability of the same detection techniques in different environments.   At the same time, the project will carry out the necessary behavioural work to create detailed rules for the normal (safe) and abnormal (unsafe) interaction of pedestrians and vehicles. These rules will initially be developed independently of the pilot project locations, but the rules generated will be used in the behavioural evaluation of the pilot projects. This will make it possible to go beyond the normal assessment of such schemes in terms of success or failure, by making it possible to obtain an understanding of how the behaviour of pedestrians and vehicle drivers is affected by the schemes and therefore of what the requirements for success are. This work will permit the generalization of project results to other locations and other types of implementation.   Together with the results of the experimental work, the behavioural rules will provide the necessary tools for future application of the project's methods and techniques for solving the problems of vulnerable road users.   Key Issues    reliable detection of VRUs  the incorporation of passive detection of pedestrians into traffic schemes  variation in pedestrian response to implementations incorporating the ATT technology  changes in pedestrian-vehicle interaction resulting from the implementations  prediction of the outcome of future implementations   Expected Achievements At present, pedestrians encounter significant safety and mobility problems when crossing major roads in urban areas. The project implementations are intended to demonstrate that the systems, developed in DRIVE I for improving pedestrian comfort and safety at signalized crossings, can be incorporated into large-scale urban traffic schemes, where the pedestrian signals are linked to urban traffic control systems. They are also intended to demonstrate that these systems are viable in a number of countries, in both northern and southern Europe. The costs of such VRU implementations will still be comparatively low, especially when compared with the overall cost of most traffic schemes. The potential benefits, in a situation where time and safety for VRUs can at present often be obtained only at the expense of considerable congestion for vehicular traffic, will be large. It is therefore confidently expected that, if the implementations prove viable, these techniques will become commonplace in the future. Such fut re implementations will be greatly assisted by the behavioural rules and modelling tools to be developed. These will provide a source of knowledge, advice and prediction, and will therefore constitute an essential set of tools in the design of future schemes.   Expected Impact   The project is expected to verify that ATT techniques that incorporate the passive detection of pedestrians can be incorporated into traffic signal control in a variety of environments in such a way as to improve vulnerable road user comfort and safety. The project will also demonstrate the feasibility of using such techniques together with advanced means of traffic control.   Contribution to Standardisation   It is expected that the techniques applied in the pedestrian crossing facilities to be implemented will become the basis for future national and European standards.",0,0

847,205653,No,Homelessness as unfairness,"Empirically informing a European theory of justice is a complex and challenging endeavour, however the emergence of current social crisis, and the resulting inequalities and unfairness, bring about the need to revise the premises that facilitate translation of the theory into concrete guidance to effective social policies and coherent programs and practices.  To respond to this challenge, a trans-disciplinary Consortium has been organized to provide a comprehensive series of empirical data, in different ecological levels, in order to understand differences in perceptions of inequality.   Through a case study on an extreme expression of inequality and unfairness - LONG-TERM HOMELESSNESS – organized in a multi-method and convergent design, HOME_EU is focused on understanding: a) How much inequality do EU Citizens accept regarding Homelessness; b) How the people with a lived-experience of Homelessness (both present and past) perceive the opportunities, choices and capability gains with the services and the existing social policies; c)  What strategies consider the service providers to be more effective in reversing Homelessness; d) How social policies and policy key stakeholders contribute to effectively reverse Homelessness; and e) Develop a generalizable indicator (correlating the different ecological levels of analysis) based on the data gathered by each partner country on the key elements of policy and program efficacy.  We believe that with this journey into an extreme situation, we are able to generate translational knowledge about the ecology of long-term Homelessness and contribute towards the advancement of an empirically based EU theory & practice of justice as fairness.",0,0

The intention is to design a set of policy guidelines, which can be used to improve the support and preparation of environmental policies and strategies in EU countries.  The research consists of :   i) a description of meta-analysis issues is given (meta-analysis being defined as a quantitative analysis of the use of methods's systems for analysis in policy formulation), including definitions, general purposes, relevant literature, and open issues ;    ii) an inventory of environmental policy methods is made including a review of environmental policy goals and instruments, literature review and case studies aimed at examining actual practices in policy preparation;    iii) a framework for meta-analysis is developed including a multi-dimensional classification of methods for policy analysis, a discussion of issues of measurement, comparability, the combination and integration of methods, and a conceptual and theoretical discussion of the various techniques for meta-analysis (meta-methods) ;    iv) a meta-analysis of the inventory of cases is performed, also describing different way of assembling the material;    v) a set of policy guidelines are developed.",0,0
965,94292,No,Integrated approach to IMprove the supply chain for COntainer transport and integrated SECurity simultaneously,"There are two contradicting trends in global transport (which are valid also for the segment of containers and other ILUs ) that have to be aligned in the most efficient way – assuring free trade and assuring transport security. Thus, it is essential that private end-users and public end-users work together on the improvement of supply chain security to ensure public safety and security as well as the efficient flow of goods. IMCOSEC – “Integrated approach to IMprove the supply chain for COntainer transport and integrated SECurity simultaneously” is a risk based approach to identify and characterize the security gaps, preventive measures will be discussed and a guiding concept for demonstrations in phase II will be defined, with the aim to make the supply chains in their totality more secure without major negative impacts on their performance and without creating unjustifiable additional cost. An optimal solution will be creating win-win situations between industry and administration and will not imply as much security as possible, but as much security as needed and acceptable. Acceptance is one of the most important issues on the sustainability of the strategic roadmap to be developed. Therefore the consortium results will be discussed, reflected and validated by a series of international workshops with stakeholders and the projects Advisory Board involving additional stakeholders from private end-users and public end-users. This will mainly contribute to European wide awareness and shall ensure that the target processes defined and technologies assembled will be applicable in the real world business. The partners are well experienced in the sector – either from its logistics or from its security angle. The Consortium includes international associations, security consultants and research institutions, experts from the maritime and inland/combined transport, as well as an operator of a container security platform.",0,0
1128,82368,No,Making microarrays rational - computational prediction of DNA duplex stability,"DUPLEX focuses on non-covalent interactions, which are pivotal in self-assembly and supra-molecular chemistry. We address the fundamental question of the nature of the stability of oligonucleotides (and ultimately DNA itself) based on model ab initio calculations. Since stability is not just due to intrinsic features and substituent effects in the gas phase we will link our work with molecular simulation studies. We will constantly contrast our findings with the extensive literature study on MD and MC simulations of oligonucleotides that we carried out already. However, due to the enormity of the central question and the limited time scale we will not perform simulations ourselves. Furthermore we envisage interacting with the large experimental group of a colleague in the School of Chemistry, called Prof DB Kell.  His lab has expertise in measuring melting curves obtained by UV spectrophotometry and microcalorimetry. This proposal builds on a paper we recently published in J.Am.Chem.Soc. [vol.124, p.8725 (2002 )] There are three objectives: (1) Determine the validity of Jorgensen well-cited secondary interaction hypothesis for a sizeable set of modified bases. (2) Establish the effect of substituent effects on the stability of H-bonded base pairs. (3) Via ab initio calculations estimate stacking interaction energies for natural bases and N6-methyladenosine and 5-methylcytosine.  Very recently computing power has reached the level where benchmark energies for a variety base pair configurations can be obtained from first principles. With state-of-the-art ab initio calculations we will obtain insight into pi-pi stacking for smaller model systems and at lower level for ribose/phosphodiester-linked base pairs. The rigorous partitioning theory called Quantum Chemical Topology will feature strongly. Epigenetics and important biological techniques such as PCR and Kunkel mutagenesis will benefit from the deeper understanding resulting from this project.",0,0
931,227655,No,"The ‘Citizenship Industry’: Commodified citizenship, the corporate sector and global inequality","Originally introduced by the Caribbean microstate St. Kitts and Nevis in 1984, the possibility of buying citizenship via citizenship-by-investment (CBI) schemes has more recently spread across the Caribbean and to Europe. This proliferation of CBI, the associated commodification of citizenship and migration, the increase in corporate political power and reworking of social inequality are of fundamental importance to Europe and global society. Yet, CBI has received scant scholarly attention and particularly the ‘Citizenship Industry’ – the corporations and industry bodies driving and profiting from CBI – remains largely unexamined. ‘CitIndus’ addresses these gaps. It will explore how corporations effectively created, skilfully perform and arguably control the global citizenship market; illuminate their role in the proliferation of CBI, in shaping global migration regimes and as increasingly influential intermediaries between governments and citizens. Examining the Citizenship Industry will also further our understandings of how citizenship mediates global and local social inequalities and how its commodification reworks these structures of inequality. CitIndus thus advances interdisciplinary social science on citizenship, migration and social inequality. It also meets growing calls to embed migration research more effectively within social theory and advances the conversation between cutting-edge postcolonial and political economy approaches. Methodologically, CitIndus takes the innovative approach of 'following’ the Citizenship Industry, synthesising complementary qualitative methods, including document analysis, interviews, participant observation and qualitative GIS. CitIndus will be supervised by two world-leading experts: Prof Torpey, an authority on citizenship and the state at CUNY, and Prof Jazeel, an authority on postcolonial geography and migration at UCL and its Migration Research Unit, a European hub for migration research.",0,0
638,44608,No,Metropolitan cities and sustainable use of water.,"Water management will be one of the main environmental problems of the 21st century. Large urban centres are major consumers of water but also offer unique opportunities for economies of scale in water conservation. Tackling water management at the city level makes also sense in terms of the clearly defined institutional framework, the direct motivation of local actors and the concentration of data and monitoring capacity.  The objective of the proposed project is to identify and evaluate alternative sustainable policies and policy instruments for water management in metropolitan European cities and areas. This will involve building up a system of relevant indicators and performing a case study analysis of selected European cities? where the success and failure factors of existing policies will be thematically analyzed and the alternative strategies for the sustainable use of water will be assessed.  The 1st work package of the project involves the preparation of expert reports by the partners of the research network in key topics relating to the sustainable use of water in metropolitan cities (e.g 'innovative technologies for urban water-saving', 'socio-cultural factors shaping water demand', 'experience from the use of financial instruments in water-saving', etc). In the 2nd work package. a list of appropriate indicators to measure the sustainability of urban water use will be prepared and measured in the case cities (Amsterdam, Athens, London, Seville, Tel Aviv). In the third work package policies affecting water use in the case cities will be evaluated in five key sectors (technology, administration, society, economy and environment) and the crucial barriers and critical success factors will be identified by survey research and will be illustrated by the pentagon prism method. This will lead the way to the identification of alternative city strategies and policy instruments for sustainable water use (4th work package).  In addition to the conclusions from each case study and the emerging strategies which will be of use to the local planning actors, a European dimension will be given to the project in the form of 'European Guidelines for the Sustainable Use of Water in Metropolitan Cities'. The results of the project will be useful to other EU cities' authorities and to a number of EU actors (DGXI, DGXII, DGXVI, Task Force on Water). At completion of the scientific work of the project. workshops will take place in the case cities to disseminate the results to the public and to discuss with the local actors the possibilities and directions for action.",0,0
277,226972,Yes,Innovation services and key account management support for Basque SMEs for 2020-2021,"EU-28 SMEs made a significant contribution to the recovery and subsequent expansion of the EU-28 economy. They accounted for 47% of the total increase from 2008 to 2017 in the value added generated by the non-financial business sector, and for 52% of the cumulative increase in employment in the sector. In fact, their contribution exceeded what would have been expected on the basis of their relative importance in the economy.  The internationalisation of SMEs is this year's special theme. SMEs can expand internationally in a number of different ways. Examples include exporting or importing goods and services, making outward foreign direct investment or attracting foreign investors to their business, becoming part of a national value chain which has an international focus, or being part of a global value chain, engaging in cross-border R&D and innovation collaboration, or licencing or franchising products or services.  Thus, innovation management plays a key role at this respect and the Basque Country is not an exception at all.   Programs supporting SME exports benefit directly only a sub-set of SMEs. However, indirectly, all SMEs benefit to some extent from growth in exports as higher exports raises a) overall income levels, and hence the demand for goods and services sold by domestic demand facing SMEs, and b) the demand for goods and services originating from exporting- oriented enterprises. Some of the main drivers for a high competitiveness score can be linked to the presence of strong skills and innovation capacity and capability, entrepreneurship and easy access to finance. In the Basque Country we are very much aware of this scenario and that is why the Basque Node has designed an implementation plan aiming at contributing to the objectives of COSME. Facilitating access to European and international markets for Basque SMEs and by providing growth-oriented, integrated business and innovation support services that help strengthen the competitiveness.",1,1
167,79229,Yes,The insecure perspectives of the low skilled in the knowledge society,"The European Low-wage Employment Research network LoWER, started 1996 under FP4, proposes to continue its activities focusing on the uncertain position of the low skilled in societies increasingly functioning on the basis of formal knowledge, particularly for allocating jobs - and thus income and social and self-esteem. The network provides important links to new research including that of many European projects. It will consolidate its membership, broaden its base in the candidate countries and shift its f ocus. The study of changes occurring in the functioning of present-day labour markets and work organisations regarding skill contributes importantly to the understanding of developments towards and potential effects of a knowledge-based society. In the low -skilled and low-paid labour market the structures of time (part-time jobs), skill (overeducation and lacking training) and households (worklessness, inheritance) are evolving rapidly, with strong interactions, to the disadvantage of low-skilled persons an d social cohesion. The network will stimulate the study of these trends bringing together in the perspective of the low skilled (workshops, open-call conferences, expert groups, exchange of personnel) scholars who have built a tradition of research co-oper ation stretching well beyond the network. The work is organised in packages addressing 1) individual mobility & employer behaviour, 2) household behaviour & intergenerational transmission, 3) gender & skills and 4) skills & training - each contributing to the study of the above trends. Interestingly, levels, processes and trends differ significantly across countries (e.g. declining part-time employment in some countries) and much can be learned from international comparisons, including the U SA. They will also be considered from different angles, micro meso and macro, and explicitly address the demand side. The activities go beyond pure analysis to enable #",1,1
921,188825,No,"Monitoring and Assessment of Regional air quality in China using space Observations, Project Of Long-term sino-european co-Operation","Due to the strong economic growth in the China in the past decade, air pollution has become a serious issue in many parts of the country. Therefore, up-to-date regional air pollution information and means of emission control for the main pollutants are important for China. Especially, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River deltas are known as three focal regions with serious air pollution where air quality policies are very important. Within the FP6 project AMFIC atmospheric environmental monitoring over China was addressed by a team of both Chinese and European scientists. Within AMFIC it was concluded that modelling of air quality and therefore the forecast capabilities are hampered by the rapidly changing emissions due to economic growth. In addition, air quality measures could not directly be related to changes in emissions. Therefore, within the follow-up proposal - MarcoPolo - the focus will be on emission estimates from space and the refinement of these emission estimates by spatial downscaling and by source sector apportionment. Air pollutants cover both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. A wide range of satellite data will be used from various instruments. From these satellite data, emission estimates will be made for NOx, SO2, PM and biogenic sources. With various state-of-the-art techniques emission inventories will be created and intercompared. By combining these emission data with known information from the ground a new emission database for MarcoPolo will be constructed. Due to the strongly growing economy in China regular emission inventories are quickly outdated. Within MarcoPolo we will have a monthly update of the emissions based on the latest satellite observations. The improved emission inventory is input to regional air quality models on meso-scale and urban-scale. End-users and decision makers will be informed about air quality via visualized model results and forecasts.",0,0
287,103882,Yes,"""""Migration and Temporary Agency Work in the EU welfare, tourist and agricultural sectors""""","'Migrants constitute the most significant pool of workers at the disposal of the EU member states that wish to expand flexible forms of labour in order to meet the demands of their increasingly ageing and diverse population. They usually fit best the profile of the poor and vulnerable segments of society that would readily take the low status, low pay jobs, yet their freedom of movement towards (and within) the EU labour markets is restricted by inflexible migration policy regimes leaving the space open to a wide array of social networks to construct pathways of entry.  Interdisciplinary research touching on the issue of the migrants’ integration in host societies has indicated so far that the ways migrants enter the host country are somehow related with the work opportunities and conditions they experience. This project aims to systematically investigate the factors determining the forms of temporary agency work in specific economic sectors.  The key contribution of the proposed study from a conceptual perspective is that it tackles issues having to do with the socioeconomic context of work and its organisation as well as questions related to the socio-political framing of the (migrant) worker’s mobility. From an empirical and policy-related perspective, the significance of this research project consists in addressing the question of temporary agency work in a comparative setting across labour markets with different settings of work and across two EU countries experiencing different and managing differently migration flows.'""",1,1
1085,84664,No,Political responses in the Middle East: from civil disobedience to martyrdom,"DNA replication is at the core of life and strongly appeals to the imagination. It is also a textbook example of template-directed synthesis, involving enzyme-assisted molecular recognition of incoming bases by the template strand. Yet, in spite of much effort, many fundamental questions about its mechanism are open.  In this project, using a quantumchemical approach, we aim at two main objectives: - understanding the electronic nature of molecular recognition in DNA base pairs, in artificial mimics thereof and in larger, macromolecular aggregates of related systems; - unravelling the mechanism of the highly accurate, enzyme-assisted DNA replication and, in particular, understanding the role of hydrogen bonding, steric factors and solvent effects in this multistep process. The two subprojects are intimately connected and reinforce each other.  We wish to explore the possibilities of rationally designing monomers whose capability to undergo self-organization can be switched on or off chemically (by a third agent) or physically (by radiation). Potential applications are the controlled and selective formation of macromolecules, nanostructures and materials. Furthermore, a better knowledge and, thus, tuning and control of the DNA replication process is envisaged. On the long term, we hope to contribute to the development in general of quantumchemical approaches to biologically relevant problems, i.e., quantumbiology.  Our computations are mostly based on density functional theory (DFT) but also on high-level abinition theory as well as molecular mechanics (MM). Extensive validation studies, by others and us, have shown that DFT is the method of choice, both in terms of efficiency and accuracy, for large biochemically relevant molecules that involve hydrogen bonding.  Our approach furthermore involves the application and further development of hybrid QM/MM techniques for tackling realistic model systems of the template-primer-enzyme complex involved in DNA replication.",0,0
993,82446,No,"The European IFRS revolution: compliance, consequences and policy lessons","The proposed research will analyse and evaluate the impact of EU-mandated harmonisation of financial reporting based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It will document levels of compliance with IFRS and the institutional, legal and economic determinants of compliance, changes in financial reporting quality and their determinants, and the economic consequences for firms and stakeholder groups. The research addresses questions that are crucially important to the future development of the European economy and financial markets.  The project will overcome fragmentation in financial accounting research across European universities. An intensive network-wide training programme will develop the research competences of a new generation of accounting researchers. It will nurture conceptual and analytical abilities and develop the technical skills necessary to conduct large-scale empirical research. The project will overcome the significant barriers to such research by developing new databases and opening up wider access to existing commercial databases.  The programme will also aim to foster industry-academia cooperation. Through an advisory group, the project team will work closely with members of regulatory bodies, including the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG). The project advisory group will assist in identification of relevant research questions, provide feedback on research projects, and assist in the dissemination of result s to policy makers, the accounting profession and industry.  The scientific programme is based on the view that financial reporting is a multi-disciplinary phenomenon and part of a complex equilibrium that also includes the legal and institutional frameworks within which businesses exist. The project will thus integrate relevant theory and empirical methods in accounting, finance, law and economics.",1,0
254,214688,Yes,New issues in the Analysis of Business Cycles,"The last decade had seen an increasing recognition that financial markets play a key role over the business cycle. Still, there have not been many detailed, systematic, empirical investigations on the consumption, employment and investment effects of the interaction between macroeconomic policies and the evolving structure of credit markets. This proposal aims to develop a research agenda over the next five years that combines insights from disaggregated data sets --which are either newly available or I propose to construct-- on (i) mortgage originations, (ii) the supply of household financial products and (iii) firms’ debt originations, with the development of theoretical frameworks that introduce credit supply and demand heterogeneity in the analyses of consumption and investment decisions. Three features of this proposal make it of potentially high impact. On the empirical side, the analysis of existing and novel detailed households’, firms’ and lenders’ data sets will allow us to identify new stylized facts on the transmission of monetary policy to real activity through financial markets (and leverage and asset prices in particular). On the theoretical side, these stylized facts will be used to develop and discriminate among competing channels of macroeconomic policy transmission. Finally, the regularity highlighted in both the empirical and theoretical analyses will inform the public debate on the design of future monetary and macro-prudential policy interventions.Each project (i)-(iv) describes an overall theme, which is expected to have several ramifications in terms of publishable papers, policy reports and possibly dissertation contents for PhD student(s).",1,1

These alarming findings prompted many research groups, to search for novel strategies to treat severe infectious diseases. Many of these approaches are focused on so-called “host effector systems”, since evidence has accumulated that complications from an infection are caused by an over-stimulation of host defense systems that are modulated by bacteria or bacterial products. In severe infections, such as sepsis and septic shock, vascular leakage, increased cytokine levels, and coagulation/fibrinolysis dysfunction are often observed. Thus, the research projects presented in this application focus on the identification and characterization of molecular mechanisms that lead to these complications with a focus on severe infections caused by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes.

706,217971,No,Spoils of War: The Economic Consequences of the Great War in Central Europe,"2018 will be a momentous year in Central Europe. It will mark the centenary of the end of World War I and the collapse of the Habsburg Empire. Political disintegration has long been blamed for the economic troubles of the successor states, but these consequences have not been subjected to sufficient examination, nor were they distinguished from the economic consequences of the Great War.  My ambition is to fill this knowledge gap. I will measure systematically how the war changed (i) industrial structure, (ii) business performance, and (iii) living standards in the regions of the Habsburg Empire. I will explain, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the mechanisms that drove these changes. I will compare real wages, the spatial distribution of industry, and the performance of industrial corporations between the prewar and postwar periods. I will directly account for the impact of the war on industrial development, independent from the outcomes of postwar disintegration, using abundant, yet understudied, primary data on war spending in the Habsburg Empire. I will detect how the reallocation of resources during the war affected changes in economic conditions (i-iii) and their regional variation. In addition, my project will prepare case studies on key industries to demonstrate how they perceived these changes and what strategies they developed to address them.  SpoilsofWAR will set a new standard in the economic history of the world wars. It will generate vast volumes of new statistical evidence at the regional and micro level. Methodologically, it will break through traditional boundaries between economic and business history and integrate the analytical tools of both disciplines. It will shift focus in the recent economic history of the wars from the Second to the First World War and will improve our understanding of the economic consequences of the war using newly developed methods from both historical economic geography and comparative business history.",0,0
266,106759,Yes,Innovative Social and Employment Policies for Inclusive and Resilient Labour Markets in Europe,"The INSPIRES project aims to contribute to resilient and inclusive labour markets in Europe. It comparatively assesses the resilience and inclusiveness of labour markets in European countries, it identifies innovative policies that have contributed to resilience and inclusiveness and it analyzes strategies of policy learning that facilitate the development and transfer of these innovations within and across European nation states. In order to do so, it analyzes in-depth the evolution of labour markets policies, employment policies and social policies. Moreover, it qualitatively and quantitatively assesses the labour market position of vulnerable groups from 2000 onwards. INSPIRES covers eleven countries from all European welfare traditions: Mediterranean, Eastern-European, Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian and the continental regimes. The consortium consists of a multidisciplinary team of leading European scholars that focus on the labour market, employment issues and social policies. The INSPIRES project aims to accumulate practice-oriented knowledge on the factors that positively and negatively affect resilience and inclusiveness. It seeks to explain differences within and between countries, and within and between the labour market positions of different vulnerable groups on the labour market. INSPIRES intends to isolate the impact of national policies from the structural demographic, social and economic characteristics on labour market resilience. Building upon this analysis, it tries to identify processes of policy learning and innovation that occur in the interactions between policy makers, politicians, non-profit organizations, trade unions, business associations and other stakeholders at the European, national and regional level. The outcomes of INSPIRES contribute to facilitating policy learning and innovation processes across territorial and sectoral boundaries and to the creation of inclusive and resilient labour markets in European countries.",1,1

Government services are designed for fixed, permanently domiciled populations. In the arena of health care, these marginal mobile or recently settled populations have had limited access to government health care provision.   Jordan and Syria have pursued different models of governmental health care; Jordan has set up health centres where Bedouin have settled whereas Syria has maintained general health services for its rural population, with some mobile services for Bedouin.

A huge effort is required to develop the horizontal components and to guarantee the link with the vertical thematic component (in particular to support the GIS aspects of the water framework directive and of the Commission communication COM(2001)144 on agri-environment). This will oblige to strengthen the link with European Umbrellas such as Eurogeographics, Eurogi, Euref and international standards organisations such as ISO and OGC to develop technical guidelines to be adopted in the framework of the future legislation. The situation in MSs should be carefully examined and all proposed technologies should be tested. A specific test bed is foreseen in collaboration with USGS to make EO data interoperable through OpenGIS specifications. The ad hoc support to other DGs should continue because the expertise and support of JRC on GI-GIS aspects is more and more appreciated. In addition to DG ENV (asking to focus on E-ESDI) the JRC support should be, in principle, limited to few other DGs such as EUROSTAT, DG AGRI and DG TREN because it will be impossible to address other request with the current staff.

Research activity should continue to focus on the development of spatial indicators (for agri-environment), to the integration of GI and statistics and to data fusion, that are the basis for any additional work for the definition or monitoring of EU policies with a spatial component. This project will continue to operate the web portal of the EC for Geographic Information (www.ec-gis.org) as well to organise the annual EC workshop in GI-GIS. Ad hoc specific workshop will be organised, on a case by case basis, to address specific technical problems (e.g. the vertical component of the European Geodetic network). Planned Deliverables  Deliverables 2002:  Specific deliverables to DGs:  - Technical co-ordination of E-ESDI;  - Support the action plan of the E-ESDI and ESDI.

Output Indicators and Impact  It is intention of the project to self-assess the results achieved through the use of the JRC- 'Key Performance Indicators' (Participation in networks, High-quality peer-reviewed publications, Invited presentations & Awards, External scientific positions held by staff) as well as other ad hoc indicators 'customer oriented' such as: a) number of confirmed DG customers; b) letters of user satisfaction; c) level of awareness raised in the EC; d) number of technical documents adopted by EC; e) input to EC directives.  The project is supporting the development of a European SDI not only addressed to EC needs. Specific indicators will be developed to see the influence of this project on national decisions. Indicators must be developed finally to try to measure the degree of appreciation of the project from European umbrella and international organisations; the first is important to discuss about a possible GI-GIS topic in the future ERA. Summary of the project  This project supports the actions to create a European Spatial Data Infrastructure (ESDI). The ESDI encompasses the broad policy, organisational, technical and financial arrangements necessary to support access to spatial (geographic) information. It is seen by many as central to the response to the challenge of sustainable development. It benefits many stakeholders - government and non-government organisations, education and research institutions, the commercial sector, the community at large- at the national, regional and global level. In the EU, no legal entity exists that has a mandate to create and maintain an ESDI and address GI policy issues.  The mission of the GI&GIS project is to fill that void, and to establish the right conditions for the creation of a European Reference Centre for Geographic Information. At the crossroads of GI policy and strategy development, GI interoperability, and the conception of pan-European GI data sets, the GI&GIS project is a unique reference for issues related to GI.  Its core objective is the development of the ESDI, and the use of spatial information by sectorial policies. Key actions are:  - Assisting in GI policy development, including terms and conditions for the acquisition, use, maintenance, and dissemination of all geo-referenced data used by EC services to formulate and monitor EU policy.  - To support the creation and the updating of pan-European data sets such as CORINE land cover, Natura2000, European Catchments Information System, and European Agro-Meteo products.  -Operating a technology watch in the areas of interoperability, standards development and use, testing and demonstrating their importance.  - Addressing methodological issues related to integrated spatial assessment relevant to EU policy analysis, which includes data fusion, spatial analysis, spatial statistics and data representation;  - To provide scientific and technical support to the services of the Commission and disseminate information to the European GI community via the Internet.  Rationale  The use of trans-national Geographic Information (GI) will increase enormously over the next few years. Improved access to high quality GI is an important support for European policy, social, and environmental issues, paramount in the light of the Enlargement of the EU. There are clear signals of the increasing awareness of spatial aspects in EU policies (6th Environment action plan, Water Framework directive, habitat directive, Nitrate directive) and the creation of COGI (permanent inter-service group of the Commission) is a clear answer to such demand. Given the role that GI plays, it is important that GI be created and distributed as economically as possible, and that duplication is prevented. The role of the EU institutions is to ensure that right conditions are met to guarantee efficient GI creation and sharing. Territorial management is multi-disciplinary by its very nature.  The sustainable development principles, agreed at Rio and Kyoto meetings, are examples of developments that increase the need to combine information coming from different disciplines such as agriculture, environment, transport, fisheries, land planning and geology. The only way to succeed in combining data in a cost-effective fashion, and to keep coherence in the decision process, is by creating an infrastructure, making reference data and systems available for all users, from all disciplines, regardless of the scope and reach of their work. The solution to meet the challenges is a common framework called European Spatial Data Infrastructure (ESDI) and to develop a sound expertise on methods to be used to combine heterogeneous spatial data. To support the new initiative of DG ENV aiming to develop the legislative framework for the future Environmental European Spatial Data Infrastructure (E-ESDI) some priorities should be revised and the effort should be channelled to guarantee the success of E-ESDI. The directive is targeted to be adopted in 2004 but its implementation will require several years and a huge co-ordination and technical support where JRC could play a relevant role (in perfect agreement with the subsidiary principle). At the same time other DGs, such as DG TREN, are showing new interest in being supported by the project to start the process of building SDI for their specific needs (e.g. TEN).",0,0
944,24946,No,EC concerted action on accidental exposure to HIV-1 and other retroviruses,"The general objective of this Concerted Action was to study adverse exposures to HIV-infected patients in major centres with a well defined protocol.  The specific objectives were:  - To study the pathogenesis of transmission of HIV-1 and other retroviruses through percutaneous injuries, mucous membrane contact, and other adverse exposures;  - To describe the circumstances of these adverse exposures, including infection control precautions in use at the time;  - To record the clinical and laboratory features of acute HIV infection in exposed workers who become infected (the window period; prognostic markers of infection; the pathogenic course of hypothetically different virus strains; characteristics of the source case);  - To observe the subsequent natural history of HIV infection in those occupationally infected workers with documented seroconversion;  - To make available information to assist post-exposure counselling of occupationally exposed workers;  - To provide information for health authorities on occupationally acquired HIV-1 and other retrovirus infections in different European countries. Health care workers have frequent occupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) though the rate of transmission appears to be low: about 0.3%, or 3 per 1000 percutaneous exposures according to studies carried out in United States health care workers. In Europe, numerous case reports describing individual incidents of occupational transmission have been published, but these do not allow calculation of the magnitude of risk since no denominators are available. Given the infrequent occurrence of occupational HIV transmission, it was decided to carry out a multicenter prospective study of the subject which would combine data from a number of European countries. 10 European Community (EC) and 3 Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) countries have agreed to participate in this study of occupational exposure to HIV in health care workers. Through 31 December 1993, 4 countries have submitted 477 questionnaires reporting cases of accidental exposures: Spain (269), United Kingdom (140), Greece (40) and Denmark (28). Of the 477 exposures, 264 (55.3%) have been followed up for at least 6 months. 2 seroconversions have been detected, both following hollow bore needlestick accidents in the United Kingdom, giving an overall transmission rate of 0.76%. Most exposures have been in nurses (54.9%), followed by physicians (26.8%) and nursing assistants (9.2%). Over two thirds of the accidents (71.1%) involved percutaneous injuries (mostly needlesticks), while 27.3% were mucocutaneous exposures. In addition, summary data are available from:  Madrid, Spain (2 seroconversions among 1290 exposures, for a transmission rate of 0.16%);  Italy (3 seroconversions among 1727 exposures, for a rate of 0.17%);  France (3 seroconversions among 769 exposures, for a rate of 0.5%);  Switzerland (362 exposures);  Sweden (42 exposures);  Finland (3 exposures). 7 of the 8 seroconversions detected in these studies have occurred in nurses and 7 of 8 were the result of accidents with hollow bore needles. Only one seroconversion (in Italy) has occurred as a result of mucocutaneous exposure. Health care workers have frequent occupational exposure to HIV-1, through the rate of transmission appears to be low: about 0.3%, or 3 per 1000 percutaneous exposures, according to studies carried out in US health care workers.

Given the infrequent occurrence of occupational HIV transmission, it was decided to carry out a multicenter prospective study of the subject which would combine data from a number of European countries. To date, ten EC and three COST countries have agreed to participate in this study of occupational exposure to HIV in health care workers, now ending its second year.   Through 31 December 1993, four countries have submitted 477 questionnaires reporting cases of accidental exposure: Spain (269), United Kingdom (140), Greece (40) and Denmark (28). Of the 477 exposures, 264 (55.3%) have been followed up for at least 6 months. Two seroconversions have been detected, both following hollow bore needlestick accidents in the United Kingdom, giving an overall transmission rate of 2/264 or 0.76%.   Most exposures have been in nurses (54.9%), followed by physicians (26.8%) and nursing assistants (9.2%). Over two-thirds of the accidents (71.1%) involved percutaneous injuries (mostly needlesticks), while 27.3% were mucocutaneous exposures. Thirty persons received prophylaxis with zidovudine (ZDV): 16 from Greece (40% of that country's reported exposures), and 14 from Spain (5% of their reported exposures).   In addition, summary data are available from the Autonomous Community of Madrid, Spain (2 seroconversions among 1290 exposures, for a transmission rate of 0.16%); Italy (3 seroconversions among 1727 exposures, for a rate of 0.17%); France (3 seroconversions among 769 exposures, for a rate of 0.5%); Switzerland (362 exposures); Sweden (42 exposures); and Finland (3 exposures). Seven of the eight seroconversions detected din these studies have occurred in nurses (occupation for one was not reported), and seven of eight were the result of accidents with hollow-bore needles. Only one seroconversion (in Italy) has occurred as a results of mucocutaneous exposure.",0,0

253,102503,Yes,Social IMpact Policy Analysis of Technological Innovation Challenges,"The objective of SIMPATIC is to provide policy makers with a comprehensive and operational tool box allowing for a better assessment of the impact of research and innovation policies in Europe.  SIMPATIC represents a unique bottom-up project proposal, bringing together micro and macro researchers with expertise in evidence-based policy analysis and impact assessment of research and innovation policies, thus allowing European innovation policy makers to better address EU2020 challenges.  Insights from micro-analysis and micro-evidence, including SIMPATIC’s own frontier pushing ex-post policy impact analysis of R&D subsidies and tax credits, will be used as input in SIMPATIC’s sectoral EU macro models, DEMETER and GEM-G3.  These models have already regularly served in the assessment of innovation and environmental policies in Europe, and have thus proven their strength as support tools for ex ante and ex post assessments of EU policies. With SIMPATIC’s proposal,  these models will be upgraded to include the latest insights from micro models in order to better respond  to the new, grand challenges of RTD policies, including environment and social inclusion;  SIMPATIC will thus develop and  use the best possible evidence and methodologies to simulate the impact of a number of research and innovation policy alternatives, providing new insights into the potential impact of various policy alternatives, thus contributing to advancing impact assessment and evidence based innovation policy design in Europe.",0,1
952,97559,No,"BIOTREATMENT OF DRINKING WATER RESOURCES POLLUTED BY PESTICIDES, PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER MICROPOLLUTANTS","BIOTREAT brings together six research institutions and four SMEs to develop much-needed water treatment biotechnologies for removing pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other organic micropollutants from contaminated drinking water resources. These biotechnologies will be developed into prototype biofilter systems ready for subsequent commercialisation. The biofilters will contain non-pathogenic pollutant-degrading bacteria, with the bacteria being immobilised on specific carriers to ensure their prolonged survival and sustained degradative activity. Through beyond state-of-the-art research, BIOTREAT will ensure that these novel water treatment biotechnologies are highly transparent, reliable and predictable. Two complementary biotreatment strategies will be followed, one based on metabolic processes whereby the bacteria completely mineralise specific micropollutants and the other based on cometabolic degradation utilising the ability of methane- and ammonium-oxidising bacteria to unspecifically degrade a range of micropollutants for which specific degraders are not yet available. The biofilter systems will be carefully validated through cost-benefit analysis and environmental life cycle assessment. A road map will be drawn up for post-project exploitation, including individual SME business plans. Effective dissemination of the BIOTREAT results will be ensured by close collaboration with an End-user Board comprised of representatives from waterworks, water authorities, industry, etc. In addition to bringing considerable advances to water treatment biotechnology, the main outcome of BIOTREAT will thus be prototype biofilter systems (metabolic and cometabolic) ready for commercialisation in a number of highly relevant water treatment scenarios, including existing sand filters at waterworks, mobile biofilters placed close to groundwater abstraction wells, sand barriers between surface waters and abstraction wells, and protective barriers in aquifers.",0,0
653,97563,No,Policy Incentives for the Creation of Knowledge: Methods and Evidence,"The ongoing global economic crisis is seriously challenging advanced capitalistic economies. In the last year the GDP has fallen at dramatic rates, creating the conditions for the upsurge of unemployment, above all in areas characterized by specialization in mature industries. According to recent growth models and empirical evidence, innovation and knowledge creation represent the main factors able to improve the competitiveness and the long run perspectives of growth of countries. Yet, innovation and technology policies have mainly been designed by relying on a supply side perspective so as to affect the creation of knowledge by providing funds to carry out R&D activities and by enhancing education and training for researchers. However, a debate has recently emerged, about the need for grafting innovation and technology policies in a demand-oriented framework. The aim of this project is to provide an original contribution to the ongoing debate, advancing the understanding of the mechanisms through which demand-based innovation policies may stimulate effective knowledge creation process, and eventually trigger competitiveness and productivity growth. To this purpose, the research activity will consist of both theoretical models and empirical analyses, the results of which should be able to inform the policy design process. We shall distinguish between public and private demand for both final and intermediate goods and services and will analyze their effects on the generation, diffusion and exploitation of technological knowledge by articulating the research activity on different dimensions (regional, sectoral and institutional). The research activity will be conducted by pursuing a great deal of multidisciplinarity and combining a number of diverse methodologies. The results of the analyses will in turn provide the basis upon which a taxonomy of demand-oriented technology policies may be elaborated.",1,0

Several main breakthroughs will be achieved throughout the project. On the macroeconomic level, the role of financial systems and their transmission channels on growth will be explored by innovative and tailor made econometric techniques, taken dynamic interactions between financial, product and labour markets into account. A range of indicators to measure the degree of financial integration will be constructed, and their development in time will be addressed. Moreover, insights into the working of financial institutions will be provided for the microeconomic level. The comparative approach undertaken by FINESS is especially useful to uncover catalysts and bottlenecks in the architecture of financial systems. By investigating unique datasets, the role of the financial structure, i.e., the banking sector, markets for private equity and venture capital, for improving efficiency and sustainable expansion of start ups and established firms is studied. The impacts of different degrees of financial integration on the portfolio decisions of households are explored with simulation models. Topics specifically related to the transition period of the New Member States as well as the gender dimension in turning impulses from the financial system into efficiency and growth are covered by the project. By fulfilling its goals, FINESS will provide in-depth knowledge on the relationship between financial systems and sustainable economic growth in a changing environment.",1,1
294,195004,Yes,Shifting Dynamics of Chinese Labour in a Global Perspective,"With the financial crisis stepping up the pressure on labour regimes around Europe, and with the European national economies increasingly subject to the vagaries of an uncertain Chinese growth, questions traditionally of interest only to Chinese labour specialists and rights advocates are taking a whole new dimension. Chinese labour issues have ceased to be local matters and have assumed a particular urgency, entering much of the political rhetoric of the European countries. Such diffused presence of Chinese labour in the European imaginary raises many questions and requires a thorough investigation. In particular, in the past few years, much has been written about a “rights awakening” allegedly undergoing among internal migrant workers in China. But how do Chinese workers perceive their rights? What role do Chinese state and non-state actors play in shaping this perception? And, more important, how will these shifting dynamics of Chinese labour activism affect the future of China as a “world factory”? Research that answers these questions is still scarce. The purpose of this study is threefold: a) analyse the expectations of Chinese migrant workers toward work hours and salaries, on the background of the minimum standards mandated by the current labour legislation; b) deconstruct the role played by different actors in shaping these expectation, with a particular attention to the role of the central and local state, the union, civil society organizations and foreign enterprises; c) address the implications of the rising expectations of the Chinese workers for EU investments in China and for the future of the country as a “world factory”. This research will not only give a meaningful contribution to the academic debate, but will also provide European policy-makers, companies, trade unions and labour NGOs with much needed knowledge on how to address Chinese labour issues in this new phase of the globalization process.",0,1
936,224025,No,Mitochondrial Cristae Biogenesis,"Mitochondrial cristae biogenesis is an enigma ever since the first imaging of mitochondria, the ‘powerhouses’ of eukaryotic cells, by electron microscopy in the 1950s. The mitochondrial cristae, dynamic and structurally conserved invaginations of the mitochondrial inner membrane, are essential for respiratory ATP generation. Thereby, the form and function of the mitochondrial inner membrane are deeply intertwined. Indeed, irregular or disturbed cristae morphologies are believed to cause numerous human diseases, including neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathies, metabolic disorders and cancer. Previous approaches to study cristae biogenesis have relied primarily on the use of 2D electron microscopy and biochemistry to analyse mutant cells defective in cristae formation. Based on striking pilot experiments, we propose to study cristae biogenesis by a radically different approach. We will induce synchronous cristae development in gene-edited cell lines initially defective in cristae formation. We will then follow de novo cristae biogenesis over time by combining a series of enabling approaches, including live cell and MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy, 3D (cryo) electron microscopy, label-free (SWATH) mass spectrometry, and single molecule counting. These technologies have just emerged in the last few years, and thus this proposal would not have been possible a few years ago. The primary aim of this proposal is to establish a deep, comprehensive and quantitative understanding of cristae biogenesis in human cells. Using theses insights, we will also investigate the effects of mutations in mitochondrial proteins associated with human diseases on cristae biogenesis.  Altogether, if successful, the outcome will represent a paradigm shift in our knowledge of how mitochondrial ultrastructure in healthy and diseased cells is generated and maintained. Our findings might spark innovative and novel strategies for the treatment of devastating human mitopathies.",0,0

832,60508,No,Policies for migrants looking for Treatment/Care on HIV/AIDS: Comparative Study France- Benelux,"Research objectives and content  I will focus on HIV/AIDS migrants strategies of health seeking behaviour, by comparing France and Benelux (mostly Belgium) as the host countries having different policies in that regard. The assumption sustaining my research advocates that different European policies and health care delivery systems orient various migration patterns, induce different health seeking behaviour among the migrants and therefore generate different ways of coping with the virus in the country of destination. I will compare the material, social and cultural factors, which give birth to the migration motivations of the infected people and the network they elaborate from their native country to both Benelux and France. A second hypothesis is that flexible socio-medical services providing information, legal aid and psycho- social assistance as well can be a good support for the health seekers. These structures may help them to have a better understanding of the new society and the way to receive proper care. These structures may be run either by government or non-government agencies. After concertation with official bodies for having an understanding of the policy situation, I will select two representative (and illustrative) samples from two distinct communities. One may be from South- America and another from West Africa. It will give quantitative information (supported by statistics), as well as qualitative data through in depth interviews.  The innovative aspect is twofold: - such a research has not yet been undertaken. It s a new field.  - the comparison dimension should permit to consider the potential benefits developed by each country.

143,57922,Yes,Empirical Models of the Euro Economy,"The proposed Euro Conference consists of two meetings intended to bring together researchers developing macroeconomic models of the euro area for a set of simulation and policy evaluation exercises designed to facilitate the comparison between the models. Macroeconomic models are important and established tools for informed decision-making in public policy and the private sector. The start of EMU has created a new economic and financial environment in Europe. As a result, existing models of the member economies have become inappropriate to guide decisions, as some key variables such as inflation and interest rates no longer have a national content in the EMU, while the behaviour and interrelations of others such as employment and output will change due to the vanishing of currency borders in Europe. There is, therefore, an urgent need for developing new tools for policy evaluation, for simulating alternative policy scenarios, and for forecasting. The purpose of the first conference is to promote research efforts aiming at the development of macroeconomic models of the euro area. This will be achieved by bringing together researchers involved in such efforts for a comparison of their models based on a unified framework. Similar comparison exercises have been conducted successfully in the US and in the UK, but never in the EU. The first meeting in the proposed series will compare and evaluate models of the euro area focusing on the aggregate performance of the economy. Researchers will be asked to perform simulations based on a common set of assumptions concerning monetary and fiscal policy in the euro area and external shocks. The results will be used to compare what the models say about the reaction of the euro economy to monetary and fiscal policies and external shocks in the short and the long run, and to evaluate potential differences in the performance of the national economies in the simulations.",1,1
802,92918,No,LOGistics & MANufacturing trends and sustainable transport,"Factors like global competition, labour cost, recycling technologies and environmental restrictions force companies to implement new logistics and manufacturing systems. From a transport’s point-of-view most of these new systems (e.g. offshoring) have negative impacts as they induce additional freight transport. But on the other hand they are implemented as they have positive effects like cheaper production processes (e.g. due to economies of scale) or even environmental benefits (e.g. due to recycling).  The objective of this study is    - to give an insight into new logistics and manufacturing  trends and  - their impacts on economic and environmental sustainability,  - to provide scenario based recommendations for European freight transport policy considering both economic and environmental sustainability and  - to improve existing tools (TRANSTOOLS, I-O tables) used for impact assessment and cost benefit analysis.    This will be done by analyzing status and trends of the external factors (world trade, policy & legislation, transport system, technology) and performing case studies in crucial economic sectors. These cases studies will analyze new best practices of logistics and manufacturing systems, when CO2 emissions are considered an important design criterion. These microeconomic results will be used to improve TRANSTOOLS and I-O tables.  Based on these results a scenario analysis will be done to estimate the possible impacts of these new best practices on European environmental (criteria: freight transport’s carbon footprint, products’ logistics and manufacturing carbon footprint) and economic (criterion: economic growth) sustainability. Storylines will be developed and their likeness, chances and risks estimated.   Finally transport policy’s costs and benefits will be assessed for the different scenarios. This will lead to recommendations for transport policy for reducing transport emissions without negative impacts on the other sustainability criteria.",1,0
935,216310,No,International PhD programme in NUMERICal Simulation,"Numerical simulation and scientific computing will face major challenges in the coming years, such as the development of hardware and software architectures able to deliver very high computing power, the development of specific simulation algorithms that run on HPC computers, the generation of data from “simulation experiments”, data analysis with adequate multi-D visualisation systems, statistical analysis, modelling methods combining different scales and physical models and the management of large and complex data sets (BigData). CEA has been recognized as an expert in scientific and technological research in this strategic area but ambitions to increase its competitiveness by renewing its research organisation and training capabilities, thus developing its expertise, accelerating development, and internationalizing its position. In this context, the NUMERICS project will promote cutting edge research in scientific domains with real prospects yet still poorly developed at CEA by proposing an innovative PhD training that focuses on “numerical simulation and scientific computing” as transversal research activities that will act as leading stake for CEA and further outline the existing PhD programme. The NUMERICS project will rely on internal structures (among which Maison de la Simulation) that will be stimulating base camps for all PhD students (research, training, expertise sharing, mutual exchanges). The proposed project targeting 50 international fellowships all along the programme duration will further stimulate the development of European research and human resource capacities, knowledge transfer between academic institutions and industrial stakeholders and thus strengthen the competitiveness and innovation of EU industries in this competitive area. Training NUMERICS PhDs to the high standard set out in the programme will ultimately lead to producing a new generation of researchers able to answer the societal challenges covered by CEA.",0,0

The contributions of behavioural economics have been widely recognized, but the benefits of its insights are far from fully realized. I propose four lines of inquiry that focus on how institutions interact with cognition and behaviour, chosen for their potential to reshape our understanding of important questions and their synergies across lines. The first line will study nonparametric identification and estimation of reference-dependent versions of the standard microeconomic model of consumer demand or labour supply, the subject of hundreds of empirical studies and perhaps the single most important model in microeconomics. It will allow such studies to consider relevant behavioural factors without imposing structural assumptions as in previous work. The second line will analyze history-dependent learning in financial crises theoretically and experimentally, with the goal of quantifying how market structure influences the likelihood of a crisis. The third line will study strategic thinking experimentally, using a powerful new design that links subjects’ searches for hidden payoff information (“eye-movements”) much more directly to thinking. The fourth line will significantly advance Myerson and Satterthwaite’s analyses of optimal design of bargaining rules and auctions, which first went beyond the analysis of given institutions to study what is possible by designing new institutions, replacing their equilibrium assumption with a nonequilibrium model that is well supported by experiments. The synergies among these four lines’ theoretical analyses, empirical methods, and data analyses will accelerate progress on each line well beyond what would be possible in a piecemeal approach.'""",1,0

677,217241,No,"Barbara is an Operating System Software Platform which enables IoT device manufacturers to boost their level of security, reduce time-to-market, and reduce costs.","Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to greatly influence the European economy. It was forecasted that IoT would bring revenue of approximately 2,133 billion U.S. dollars in Western Europe by 2020. Strong pressure by keen investors and managers wanting to unlock the value of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is leading to exponential growth, but the growth is happening too fast given inherent complexity of implementations. In this sense, with IoT there are appearing solutions for very critical sectors, where security is a must. Health solutions, Banking, etc.. cannot fail, and IoT solutions should be ready for this level of service. With the available tools, IT managers have no option but to take a patch-work approach that is costly, time consuming, causing fragmentation and interoperability issues, while exposing major security vulnerabilities that are left at the mercy of cyber attackers. In fact, many companies lack the skills required to handle the complexity and are burdened by heavy costs of security consultants or software needed to ‘fix’ the vulnerabilities after installation, if and when detected. In the emerging fast-growing market, Barbara project is an IoT Open Source Operating System and Management Platform focused on enhancing security for connected IoT devices. The market for IIoT devices itself is huge, worth 457 US Billions in 2020. TipTap Labs has developed Barbara, a solution that directly addresses the user pains and challenges of IIoT deployment, delivering a new operating system and management platform specially designed for connected devices, with a core focus on security designed into the system.

532,107064,No,Identifying genes and pathways that drive molecular switches and back-up mechanisms between apoptosis and autophagy,"A cell’s decision to die is governed by multiple input signals received from a complex network of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including apoptosis and programmed necrosis. Additionally, under some conditions, autophagy, whose function is mainly pro-survival, may act as a back-up death pathway. We propose to apply new approaches to study the molecular basis of two important questions that await resolution in the field: a) how the cell switches from a pro-survival autophagic response to an apoptotic response and b) whether and how pro-survival autophagy is converted to a death mechanism when apoptosis is blocked. To address the first issue, we will screen for direct physical interactions between autophagic and apoptotic proteins, using the protein fragment complementation assay. Validated pairs will be studied in depth to identify built-in molecular switches that activate apoptosis when autophagy fails to restore homeostasis. As a pilot case to address the concept of molecular ‘sensors’ and ‘switches’, we will focus on the previously identified Atg12/Bcl-2 interaction. In the second line of research we will categorize autophagy-dependent cell death triggers into those that directly result from autophagy-dependent degradation, either by excessive self-digestion or by selective protein degradation, and those that utilize the autophagy machinery to activate programmed necrosis. We will identify the genes regulating these scenarios by whole genome RNAi screens for increased cell survival. In parallel, we will use a cell library of annotated fluorescent-tagged proteins for measuring selective protein degradation. These will be the starting point for identification of the molecular pathways that convert survival autophagy to a death program. Finally, we will explore the physiological relevance of back-up death mechanisms and the newly identified molecular mechanisms to developmental PCD during the cavitation process in early stages of embryogenesis.",0,0

Based on the analysis of the SEEM needs for open frameworks, the project will contribute to the SEEm concept with the definition and development of a flexible technological framework for electronic business collaborations. The definition of this framework will especially consider the linguistic, cultural and economic aspects of SME's needs. 2) The project will analyse the actual status of the technology, the society and the public policies in relation to SEEM. As a result of this analysis, the project will populate and maintain a dynamic, self-managed knowledge base on SEEM-related research policies throughout Europe. 3) The project plans to develop technology for prototyping the SEEM in a real usage scenario involving the issues within the SEEM concept and with the objective of generating a 'proof of concept' in an important business sector for Europe. Therefore, a specific and complex industrial case is considered involving both SEEM technical issues (trust, discovery and negotiation, open standardsrequired, authentication and non repudiation of transactions, services for mobile workers,...) and SEEM stakeholders (public authorities, industry, technology providers). 4) With the input of the results from the three tasks above, the project will launch a Discussion and Dissemination Phase with the participation of all the SEEM concept stakeholders in Europe.

Summary of the Action: The main objective of this Action is to produce monitoring tools for the evaluation of sustainable development at local level with emphasis on urban and regional processes. The objectives of ECODEV are: - Development and implementation of the concept of Ecosites at EU level. This will be achieved by supporting a network of Ecosites in the Member States and by developping best practices. - Scientific & technical support to an Ecosites network for the monitoring of EU policies that have an impact on sustainable development at local level. - Implementation of Ecosites approach to the specific urban thematic aspects. - Definition of sustainability criteria in urban development policies, by developing and implementing integrated approaches for the environmental at different admninistrative level (EU, National, Regional) - Support to the European Spatial Development Perspective to facilitate the environmentally sustainable implementation of the European Spatial Observatory Network by developing reference methods, terrestrial indicators and by performing trend analysis in view of local and regional sustainability. The ECODEV component on Ecosites will support a European network of Ecosites that are practical examples and tools to implement sustainable development at local level: association of environmental protection, research and economic activity.  The ECODEV component on Sustainable Urban and Regional Development aims at facilitating the inclusion of criteria of sustainability in urban and regional development policies, by developing and implementing integrated approaches for the environmental protection and for the assessment of Structural Funds programmes, plans and projects. This component supports the definition and preparation of the Thematic Urban Strategy of the 6th Environmental Action Plan and complements the ESPON Programme set by DG REGIO. Rationale The most widely used definition for sustainable development is: 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.' Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and Chairman of the World Commission on Environment and Development, is credited with popularising this term in 'Our Common Future' (1987).  The issue of sustainable development has been growing significantly worldwide during the last few years and has been given growing importance not only by policy-makers but also by environmentalists and researchers. Further to the 1987 Bruntland Commission Report, an important step was accomplished in terms of awareness raising on the occasion of the 1992 Rio de Janeiro World Conference on Environment & Development. There was recognised or confirmed a need to develop tools or methodologies that can help to measure and assess progress towards the achievement of sustainable development goals. Such tools can for example provide an early warning or allow to take measures in order to prevent economic, social and environmental damage. It is worth noting that the indicator work performed under the United Nations Commission on Sustainable development CSD (1995-2000) suggested four main categories to be considered and monitored: social, economic, environmental and intitutional.  Regarding environmental issues, the main themes identified have been: freshwater/groundwater, agriculture/secure food supply, urban, coastal zone, marine environment, fisheries, biodiversity/biotechnology, sustainable forest management, air pollution and ozone depletion, global climate change/sea level rise, sustainable use of natural resources, sustainable tourism, land use change. In recent years, the EU has taken steps to raise awareness of the need for a more sustainable development in Europe, notably in the Cardiff process and the Gothenburg declaration. The EU also participated actively at the Rio\10 World Summit in Johannesburg (August 2002). In addition to international conventions dealing with the global level, there is a need to strengthen local initiatives and the links with European Research have been weak so far. Within the large framework of sustainable development, the ECODEV Action concentrates specifically on 1) technical/scientific support to a European network of Ecosites 2) sustainable urban & regional development.",0,0
623,48267,No,A legal and economic analysis of foreign ownership of the production in the atlantic fisheries.,"Foreign ownership on fisheries production (FOFIP) rights, commonly called 'quota hopping', mainly occurs in Atlantic and North Sea fisheries. Fisheries management in Europe has led to numerous forms of input or output based rights designed to limit access to fisheries resources : quotas, licences, kilowatts and GRT limitations. Most of these are defined in national terms : national quotas, national objectives for total kW or GRT in the MAGPs. But free movement of capital, good and labour in Europe allows for foreign investors to gain access to these rights by investing in the harvesting sector or in the distribution/processing sector when the industry is vertically integrated. This includes the purchase of 100% of a vessel or the purchase of shares in companies. Under various and contradictory arguments, national industries and governments resist or promote such purchases.   The general objective of this programme is to assess the legal and economic aspects of foreign ownership phenomena, based on a European review of the practices and the analysis of national or local situations.  These case-studies are conducted in four Member States: the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Spain. The legal analysis will assess the formal and informal barriers to foreign ownership of fish production that exist. The economic analysis will cover the identification of the economic incentives and the direct social and economic consequences for the catching sector and for the immediate onshore economies. The legal and economic dimensions of these practices will be discussed in regard of general objectives and principles of the European integration and of the Common Fisheries Policy. To meet these objectives, the research is structured in four tasks.   Task 1 is a review to what extent and under which legal framework, foreign investment takes place in the fisheries of the European Union states located along the Atlantic and the North Sea (i.e, Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Denmark). This assessment is descriptive and limited to the information that can be obtained from public sources. It has two folds : the review of the principles founding policy/legal choices regarding foreign ownership and the identification of the fisheries concerned with this phenomena  Based on four national case-studies, in countries representing the diversity of approaches in Europe, task 2 will document in a more analytical manner the formal and informal rules for guaranteeing access to national catch quotas in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Spain. The core objective of this task is to explain the evolution of the strategies and policy, as perceived by stakeholders, as transcribed in the law and as implemented through legal cases. Regional differences within countries will also be discussed. The historical background will be searched as far as the foreign ownership issue has been raised in the four countries.  The objective of task 3 is to assess the economic dimensions of foreign ownership phenomena through six case-studies on main fisheries concerned in major fisheries dependent localities. This includes the evaluation of the extent of foreign ownership in local fleets, the understanding of the diversity of economic incentives for a private investor to buy or sell abroad resource access rights, the quantitative illustration of these incentives and the most likely social and economic consequences of doing so for the catching sector and the near onshore economies. A case-study may either be focused at one harbour or one fishery. This will be done according to the results of the general review that will show to what extent foreign ownership is targeted on specific fisheries and locations. A similar methodology will be applied to each case study involving three levels of analysis. First, the extent of foreign ownership will be evaluated in terms of production means and output. Second, the incentives backing the decision by private investors to buy or sell abroad resource access rights will be investigated. This will be documented by direct interviews with all the private investors. Third, reference income distribution structures and multipliers will be used to assess the likely impact of foreign ownership on income transfer to or out of the near shore economies.   At the end of the programme a fourth task will integrate the results of legal and economic works under the framework of a discussion confronting foreign ownership practices to the principles founding the European integration and those of the Common Fisheries Policy. Policy implications will be discussed",0,0
763,185439,No,The Distribution and Redistribution of Income and Wealth: A Global and Historical Perspective,"'Income and wealth inequality has widened significantly in many developed countries during the past 40 years, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world. In some countries, e.g. the US, income concentration is now higher than in the early decades of the 20th century. EU trends are less strong, but push in the same direction. Yet, despite these puzzling facts, we still know very little about the forces behind the long run evolution of income and wealth distribution. The central objective of this proposal is to better understand the rise in inequality, and more generally to develop a unified empirical and theoretical approach to the distribution and redistribution of income and wealth. First, I propose to construct a new 'World Wealth and Income Database' (WWID) that will be made public through a dedicated website. Existing inequality data sets are insufficient, first because many countries are not well covered, and mostly because available series concentrate on income inequality and usually do not cover wealth inequality. This is unfortunate, because the theoretical forces at play are very different for income and wealth distributions. The WWID will remedy both deficiencies and allow for a better articulation between available data and theoretical models. Next, I will use this new database to test for the various mechanisms explaining the rise in inequality. In particular, I will explore the extent to which low growth and high returns to wealth naturally push towards higher wealth-income ratios as well as rising wealth concentration. In the near future this mechanism is likely to be particularly strong in low growth Europe (especially in countries with negative population growth). In the long run it can also operate at the level of the global distribution of wealth. I will also develop new theoretical models of optimal taxation of income and wealth. These models will be using a 'sufficient statistics' approach and will be calibrated using WWID data.'",1,0
986,202798,No,Effective environmental policies in Europe in the context of rebound effects,"European policymakers are increasingly concerned about the unsatisfactory outcomes of efforts to harmonise economic growth and welfare with environmental quality, in particular due to the so-called rebound effects. The main objective of the EFFECT project is to develop innovative methods to identify and quantify key rebound effects, and assess their potential to impede the achievement of environmental targets in Europe. Some specific research objectives are: (1) review and classification of key environmental policies and targets in the EU and Member States in the context of rebound effects; (2) improvement of theoretical and methodological aspects of macroeconomic models used in rebound effect studies by integrating the ‘environmental rebound effect’ perspective; (3) assessment of the impact of rebound effects via EU and country-level ex post assessment of past key environmental policies and ex ante assessment of future policy scenarios and (4) proposal of recommendations to achieve net environmental savings from environmental policies, including optimal combinations and configurations, as well as optimal levels of welfare and economic development and equality. To attain such objectives, the EFFECT project will design an innovative analytical framework by combining an interdisciplinary perspective with micro and macro-level aspects of rebound effects. Such framework would allow a more comprehensive and scientifically sound study of the interplay between rebound effects and policy. In the context of the pursuit of a sustainable economic growth in Europe, this project can aid European policymakers in the design of effective environmental policies. Furthermore, the development of innovative and state-of-the-art analytical frameworks aimed at tackling exceptional societal challenges such as climate change resonates with the ambition of putting Europe’s in-house science and researchers at the forefront of worldwide scientific excellence.",0,0
171,101144,Yes,"Atypical Works in Pre-Industrial Europe. Pluriactivity, Mobility and Social Identities","The aim of this project is to investigate atypical forms of work (professional mobility - moving from a job to another-, temporary works, pluriactivity) in pre-industrial Europe. By using a micro-analytical approach, and focusing on individuals, their biographies and career paths, the project aims at shedding a new light on the preindustrial European labor market, and to identify and describe “atypical” patterns of work. The project has the final goal to demonstrate that work, in present and past societies, was a complex social resource, that individuals manipulated/handled in a framework made of individual and household’s life-cycle, conflicting sets of rules, juridical frameworks, social networks and contexts, flexibility. Beside showing the complexity of work as resource, the aim of this proposal is to identify and describe patterns of atypical work, with a strong micro-analytical approach. to this purpose, the research will be carried out on the following topics: 1. Patterns of pluriactivity and other atypical works; 2. Alternative accesses to the labor markets; 3. The relation between professional and geographical mobility. The research will be entirely carried out on primary sources. The survey will go through a series of case studies which mirror different patterns of atypical work, in France and in Italy. To this purpose, the research will have a strong micro analytical approach, focusing on individuals and making an extensive use of biographical data. The subject of flexibility in the organization of work is a living matter: the project will be an important contribution to understand how individuals of the past societies coped with periods of crisis, unemployment and impoverishment processes, but also how work was used to enhance processes of social mobility. For this reason, the project will be of the greatest importance and utility for the European Community, and it will be a major contribution to EU scientic excellence.",1,1
879,205065,No,Feasibility of Bio-based Propylene Glycol,"Propylene Glycol (PG) is a non-toxic alcohol that is used in various consumer and industrial applications, such as food and beverage, feed, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, plastics, electronics, etc. Its unique combination of properties makes it a valuable solvent, emulsifier, stabiliser, freezing point reducer and much more.  Still, dependency on oil prices, as well as costly and environmentally unfriendly production processes make PG today an expensive additive compared to alternative Ethylene Glycol (EG), a toxic chemical with similar properties and uses, but a tenfold larger market. EG has a sweet taste and is often accidentally ingested, leading to hundreds of fatal intoxication cases around the world annually.  Estonian SME Nano OÜ has developed a novel process to produce bio-based PG from agricultural waste in a fermentation process similar to ethanol fermentation. Innovative production process and our choice of raw materials bring down the produc agricultural waste tion cost and make PG price-competitive with hazardous EG, enabling to replace the latter in various high-value applications where human exposure is inevitable.  The BioPG project helps Nano to assess the business potential and economic feasibility of the proposed innovation, and focuses on:  • Creating a business plan to define the best strategy for the commercialization of the method;  • Conducting a freedom-to-operate study to ensure no other patents are infringed by the proposed innovation project;  • Preparing a preliminary design of a pilot plant for PG manufacturing.

529,226446,No,A novel Stratified Medicine Algorithm to predict treatment responses to host-directed therapy in TB patients.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic, life-threatening infectious disease which poses a tremendous challenge for physicians, researchers and Health Systems, which treatment is long, based only on the drug susceptibility of the responsible infective strain and very costly in drug-resistant cases (MDR-TB). The European Region still has the highest prevalence of MDR-TB in the world. Host-Directed Therapies (HDT) have been recently proposed to shorten treatment length and by to improve the patients’ outcomes while not increasing the risk of generating drug resistance. As hyperinflammation is responsible of the lung damage associated to patients’ worse outcomes and sequelae, one of the approaches is to add an HDT with anti-inflammatory effect to the current drug regimen to cure the patients faster while having less permanent lung damage. Because TB has a wide range of clinical forms and severity stages, any therapeutic regimen needs to be studied in clinical trials (CT) as its benefit might differ among patients. No individualized personalized medicine is possible without stratifying the patients by integrating pathogen and host factors that will predict the course of the disease and the response to the intervention.  SMA-TB objectives are: • To evaluate in a CT the potential impact of aspirin (an anti-inflammatory HDT) as adjunct to standard therapy for drug sensitive (DS-) and MDR-TB. This potentially will reduce tissue damage, decrease the length of the treatment and the risk of bad outcomes.  • To identify and clinically validate host and pathogen biomarkers for further selection according to their relevance in terms of their ability to predict TB course and outcomes and response to treatment thanks to data science protocol.  • To generate a medical algorithm to stratify patients using network-based mathematical modelling for predicting the course of the disease and its response to the intervention, to be applied during clinical management to improve and personalize TB",0,0
368,91046,Yes,"Meeting the challenges of economic uncertainty and sustainability through employment, industrial relations, social and environmental policies in European countries","Coping with economic uncertainty while seeking security is a central dilemma of public policy in a globalising economy. A complex set of deals and conflicts are involved in the process of distributing the gains and the burdens of that uncertainty, and various forms of employment contracts and labour and social policies express their outcome. This project is concerned with the study of that process and its implications for societal models. In the course of conflict a number of different institutions engage in new practices; and there is a new diversity of employment forms and tenures. Social policy becomes increasingly integrated with employment and industrial relations practices, while both the sustainability of the institutions themselves and their impact on the natural environment require consideration.    Challenges are also presented by the different forms of governance at work in the various policy fields. The crisis of the Keynesian model was often seen as a crisis for associational governance (or neo-corporatism), and an advance for reliance on market governance (usually assisted by strong elements of government intervention). Since then, policy-making by individual large corporations often seems to be replacing associational governance as well as government policy-making in fields of employment categories and rights, pay determination, and the determination of pensions. However, the public goods issues raised by uncertainty and environmental damage bring again into question the adequacy of governance by the market and individual firms. We should expect to find radical changes in the societal models that we have become accustomed to using in the analysis of social policy. There is a search for new modes of governance, or new combinations of old ones.",1,1
767,193829,No,E-GNSS Knowledge Triangle,"The scope of the proposal is to strengthen the interaction between the areas of education-research-industry in Europe, leveraging on past activities already undertaken in this field, in order to consolidate a strong EGNSS knowledge triangle, i.e. a solid network for the creation of  a critical mass involving the relevant actors in  the three areas with the final objective of supporting the European economy development. The project approach is in line with the general policy of the H2020 programme, for the capacity building and critical mass creation in strategic areas, so to increase Europe competitiveness and attract investments from outside Europe. In GNSS this can only be realized by investing on a strong coordination between science and industry to fill the gap with respect to other areas of the world. Indeed the poor links between Industry and Research in Europe versus e.g. the US is permanently quoted as one of the reason of the constraints on innovation  With respect to previous projects in the field (ERIG, G-TRAIN, GENIUS), the focus will be more on the innovation transfer to the industry field, the support to the creation of innovative downstream applications and the consolidation of the links and of the initiatives beyond the project duration.",1,0
275,105684,Yes,"REGional Innovation pOlicy, knowledge Spillovers, Productivity, and INstitutions","The main aim of the REGIO_SPIN project is that of increasing the capacity of policy makers to design appropriate regional innovation policies in the European Union (EU). Regarding innovation policies, a paradigm shift in regional policy has occurred over the last decade in the EU, bringing innovation at the core of the regional agenda. The availability of Structural Funds, as the instrument for the EU cohesion policy, has provided regions substantial resources for innovation policy. The emphasis on the contextual nature of policy has led towards a differentiated territorial innovation policy approach or place-based policies also in EU regional policy.  In fact, regional policies are still far away from being place-based: they are often similar and based on policy imitation of 'best practices’. Furthermore, their effectiveness has been questioned. Some key questions arise: Is the region the optimal scale for innovation policy? Do regions have the necessary institutional capability to manage innovation policy? Are regional institutions learning? According to which criteria policies encouraging University-Industry linkages should be designed? These are questions which go at the hearth of the place-based approach of the EU cohesion policy.  The REGIO_SPIN project proposal aims to respond to these questions on the ground of empirical evidence. It will take an interdisciplinary perspective bringing together policy-oriented research with the geography of innovation and system of innovation, and the role of institutions. The empirical analysis, covering the European regions in several countries, is divided into three objectives: i. To explore the relationship between quality of the institutions and innovation policy impact; ii. To explore the extent to which policy leads to institution building; and iii. To explore the connection between different the nature of University-Industry linkages and types of Regional Innovation Systems.",1,1
649,110037,No,Popular Nationalism and Attitudes toward Immigrants (PNATI): A Multistage Investigation of Popular Nationalism and its Effects on Attitudes toward Labor Immigrants and Asylum Seekers in Israel,"The general framework of the proposed research challenges the traditional approaches to popular attitudes toward labor immigrants and asylum seekers. Previous scholarship has highlighted either economic competition between immigrants and the host society or perceptions of symbolic threats posed by immigrants. The proposed research, in contrast, will be the first to investigate how attitudes toward foreigners are linked to the way several dimensions of nationalism configure the national self-understanding of individuals. These dimensions include the ways individuals define the criteria for membership in their nation, their beliefs about the core values of the nation, their identification with specific national institutions, and the role they believe their nation-state should play in relationship to other nation-states. To test this theoretically groundbreaking framework, the proposed research has three specific objectives: (1) to develop an empirically robust typology of national self-understanding of resident citizens of Israel, (2) to examine the relationship of national self-understanding with core demographic characteristics of individuals, and (3) to investigate how national self-understanding affects individuals' attitudes toward labor immigrants and asylum seekers. In addition to theoretical innovation, this proposal also introduces a novel multistage research design that opens with in-depth interviews, continues with survey data collection, and ends with follow-up interviews with survey takers. Using this multistage design, the proposed research will be the first of its kind to develop a purely inductive typology of popular nationalism in a European country, and to test how the national self-understanding of individuals affects their attitudes toward immigrants and preferences regarding the state’s immigration policy.",0,0
342,79524,Yes,Collaborative Working Environment for Ageing Workforce,"This SSA proposal aims to contribute to the definition and development of a renewed European social model for one category of disadvantaged population; the ageing workforce, which is increasingly excluded from the labour market. Overall, we aim to support the revised Lisbon strategy. In this regard, Europe has to ensure that the ageing workforce remains part of the active population, so that its unique experience contributes to foster and improve Europe's competitiveness. This should increase the level of employment, resulting in higher productive activity, and ensure full support to the i2010 policies. Most EU countries should shift their paradigm, and learn from practices in other parts of the world, such as India, where the ageing workforce and expert retirees are considered a 'national treasure' (Sangathan) due to their valuable experience.  However, Indian companies have not yet reached the EU level of innovative ICT practices, and more specifically CWE, to best capitalize this knowledge and use it to improve the quality of life of the active retirees who travel a lot around the country. Thus, by both exchanging experiences and bridging the gap between user communities practices through the innovative use of the most advanced ICT tools in the work process, an important part of the European ageing workforce should be able to remain happily active in the labour market. Moreover, this will have the added benefit of resulting in the organization and capitalization of knowledge for the coming generations and co-workers.  The project will produce three main categories of results: - Identification of the specific research in CWE and ICT to cope with the needs of ageing workforce - ICT-enable the Indian social model of expert retirees, experiment it in Europe and disseminate the innovative approach - Make European ICT and research results known and adopted by the Indian market, and foster joint research projects",1,1
57,106725,Yes,"Combating inequalities through innovative social practices of, and for,  young people in cities across Europe","This project builds on research that shows the disproportionate impact of the economic crisis on young people across Europe, including excessively high rates of youth unemployment and threats to the social provision enjoyed by previous generations. This is compounded by the 'coming of age' of the descendants of recent migrant communities - who now form significant proportions of the young population in major European cities. They are Europeans in language, social habit and cultural repertoire, yet continue to face longstanding barriers as a result of membership of communities already marginalised from mainstream labour markets and wider civic life. The project brings together stakeholders from civil society experienced in practical policy-making and implementation with well-established academic researchers to: i) Map the changing demographic landscape of inequalities as seen in major cities in the EU today  and the specific challenges facing young people disadvantaged by ethnic origin, cultural background, neighbourhood, family and educational and economic situation; ii) Review approaches of different levels of government to engaging with disadvantaged youth and addressing inequality concerning young people, including state approaches and 3rd sector actions for promoting economic activity and entry into the labour market and ensuring effective distribution of services and community-led initiatives to enhance economic chances and participation in civic life; iii) Uncover innovative strategies for navigating, surviving and overcoming inequalities that have emerged, and are emerging, among young people (16-24) in deprived parts of large cities through ethnographical research with young people themselves; iv) Examine the extent to which these strategies might be regarded as socially innovative, explore through a series of pilot projects how such strategies might be transferable across Europe and use the findings for reshaping policies at EU, national and local levels.",1,1
50,107462,Yes,Systemic Risks and Macroprudential Regulation in Banking,"'The  current financial crisis raises fundamental questions concerning macroeconomics, banking stability, and economic policy.  As standard macroeconomic models provide insufficient guidance on how to respond to the crisis, policy makers in Europe and elsewhere have repeatedly intervened with a combination of largely untested  monetary and fiscal policy measures that comprise liquidity provision, quantitative easing, nationalisation, as well as other subsidies. While the microeconomics of banking is well understood, standard macroeconomics has failed to allow adequately for a financial sector. Systemic risks in the banking sector cannot be analysed in a dynamic framework.  MACROBANK closes this gap by developing a novel dynamic macroeconomic model with a micro-founded banking sector. It aims at developing a theoretical foundation and a tool box for policy makers to analyse and assess the effectiveness of possible crisis intervention strategies to improve the overall understanding of crisis intervention  and their effects on the economy.  Extending Gersbach and Wenzelburger (2011),  MACROBANK’s novel model allows to investigate the effectiveness of new crises intervention measures dynamically and to simulate policy strategies. It focuses on debt reduction, inflation control, and on how central bank activities can be restored to pre-crisis levels. Welfare distributional aspects of interventions are also considered.  The novelty and expected impact of the proposed research will increase the EU’s excellence, and the applicants teaching activities will train young researchers exposing them to cutting-edge research in economics. Thus, the proposed project leads to knowledge transfer within and into the ERA, integration of a researcher, and introduction of a promising new research approach in Europe,'",1,1

The Adverty Native XR Advertising Platform has a chance to disrupt the global digital advertising market by opening it to the realms that are still emerging and dynamically take shape. Its competitive edge is strongly marked by the 4 unique (patent pending) algorithms and other features that allow for solving the most important pain points of the advertising industry, namely viewability, efficiency measurement and relevance of the ads, as well as selling them through the mobile AR platform.  The market for this kind of services is growing rapidly. It is expected to reach approx. €10 billion by the end of 2021 at the remarkable CAGR of 38%. Adverty aims to grasp 0,4% share of this market.  In spite of being quite a young player Adverty has already entered the market with two fully commercial customers onboard. This means that the Adverty solution has been deployed into the operational environments of both VR and AR and thus reached TRL-7.  The business strategy of Adverty is to use all possible sales channels: direct sales and – as the first company in the world – a programmatic (automation) approach, in which clients are purchasing from Adverty ad inventory using real-time bidding (RTB) through global SSPs and DPSs. This aggressive sales approach mixed with carefully designed dissemination strategy will soon allow Adverty to become the leader amongst the XR advertising platforms.  In the European dimension, our solutions will allow for increasing the competitive advantage of European companies operating in the field of XR, especially considering the fact that Europe is still a net importer of US digital services.",0,0
131,201565,Yes,The Econometrics of Intergenerational Mobility,"This project studies the intergenerational transmission process of well-being, which measures the degree to which individuals and their families move between positions of social, economic and health status. Our interest in intergenerational mobility is motivated by its implications on equality of opportunity. Children are born into circumstances over which they have no control. Parents, schools, and neighborhoods transmit to children endowments and environment such as genes, economic resources, and capabilities, which shape children’s lifetime opportunities. These endowments are not only unequal by nature but also recent evidence suggests that the gaps in capabilities, which include cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, and health stock from families of different socioeconomic status diverge from early age. While little can be done about it, policy makers can break the chain of persistence of inequality by providing resources to families so that disadvantaged children can reach their true potential. While there is large body of work on measuring intergenerational income mobility little is known about its cross-country determinants and the various channels of transmission. This project aims at filling these gaps in the literature by doing two things. In doing so, we develop new ways to measure mobility that move beyond linear measures to characterizations, which allow for the existence of poverty (and affluence) traps. In doing so, we develop an econometric framework using state-of-the-art statistical techniques and econometric methods that extend the empirical analysis of mobility beyond income to capabilities following Amartya Sen and the recent work of James Heckman. Capabilities measure the capacity to function in order to expand the potential outcomes for an individual. Second, we explore the effects of changes in the monetary policy regimes on mobility by focusing on two specific mechanisms that involve credit constraints and neighbourhood effects.",1,1
541,52167,No,"Urban development programme, urban governance, social inclusion and urban sustainability","Problems to be solved During the last decade all over Europe urban development programmes have been established with a view to combat urban problems and/or to stimulate urban dynamics. These programmes have been set up in a new policy-making context, that of urban governance, the development of which they have often stimulated. Three problems will be addressed in this project. What are the effects of urban development programmes on social inclusion and urban sustainability? How did certain forms of urban governance shape these programmes, their definition, their implementation and their successes and failures? How has the presence of these programmes changed urban governance or even stimulated forms of urban governance (the feedback loop). Scientific objectives and approach To answer these problems, the project undertakes a multilevel research in 32 neighbourhoods in 9 countries. The cases are selected on two criteria. Firstly, neighbourhoods must be part of an urban development programme. They are, however, selected in such a way that a sufficient range of differentiation is obtained on a number of crucial variables. Second, to minimise new and expensive research, data should be available for at least two time periods. The research integrates multiple levels and will proceed from a comparative perspective, but will focus on the European dimension. The effects of urban programmes on social inclusion in deprived urban areas, on sustainability in the selected cities and on urban governance are assessed through the analysis of a multilevel database and through cross-evaluation by the international project team. To perform that task, smaller teams of four experts are selected from the project members and perform their evaluation in cities in a 'foreign' country, assisted by the local partner. Expected impacts A network of stakeholders is developed and activated through this collaboration and through the production of a handbook. The evaluation focuses on 'benchmarking' for evaluating the processes and outcomes of the programmes (in terms of strengths and weaknesses of types of programmes and of related forms of urban governance). The conceptual and theoretical framework forms a strong basis for a common database that will contain both quantitative and qualitative data at different levels. This framework and the methodology offer opportunities to develop a genuine European approach. A number of concrete deliverables will be developed that can be used by end-users; such as the network, reports that puts local initiatives in a European comparative context, the handbook with models of good practice. UDPs can have different effects, depending on the context, which can be defined in general terms but also in terms of the premises of the UDPs: - It is sufficient to increase the quantity and quality of the housing stock and of the urban environment in order to increase a city's sustainability? - Will the reduction of processes of social exclusion automatically lead to the promotion of social inclusion? - Is promoting a 'social mix'always the best solution? - Does focusing of areas necessarily lead to positive effects for the city? The most important cross-national dimension that needs to be taken into account when relating our findings to the policy formation process is the move 'from government to governance': that is, to - more active policies regarding social inclusion; - more locally determined policies; - 'partnership' involving the voluntary and private sectors more closely; - a more fragmented pattern of decision making that requires new forms of integration.  Some conclusions regarding the UDPs We see striking similarities between (emerging) concepts and processes (globalisation, social exclusion, social cohesion), problem descriptions (high unemployment, ethnic tensions, ageing populations, unemployment), policy rhetoric and objectives (increasing sustainability and social cohesion) and techniques (area-based policies, co-operation, networking, participation). There is 'a convergence of views about the problems they face and the kind of policy responses they should be adopting'. Particular themes and issues that stand out in the context of recent urban policies across Europe are: electoral systems, such as compulsory voting stimulating 'protest votes'; continuity within approaches, leading to relatively straight forward adaptation to new conditions, like the 'master plan' policy changes; intra-country differences through variant policy innovations; impact of wider political-economic events; traditions of centralism and the complex relationships between central and 'lower' political and administrative levels; inheritance of previous authoritarian political regimes. However, our research also reveals differences relating to governance context rooted in socio-institutional patterns and traditions. These patterns and traditions add up to variation in: socio-spatial structures; political and administrative arrangements; practices of local and regional government; and relationships between government and the public at large embedded in wider relations between institutions of the state and civil society.  Five aspects that distinguish case studies stands out: Timing Initiator Motivations Problem areas Anchorage in a broad institutional framework In other words, while we observe policy convergence on the one hand, we are simultaneously witnessing diversity among nations in terms of governance characteristics. To try and grasp and conceptualise this double dynamic and work towards a conceptual framework for analysis has become one of the challenges of the UGIS project. This framework should, we believe, offer a means for explaining the differences among nations in terms of their governance characteristics, and also the means for guiding comparative analysis across the UGIS case studies. We argue that a conceptual framework should be based on a combination of welfare regimes and governance models offers the means to analyse these shifts in governance and the balance between state and non-state, central and local, through UDPs in Europe. Such a framework, we hope, offers the starting point for subsequent comparison of UDPs and other policies across Europe. Relevance for policy-making The aim of our handbook for policy-makers ('How to make a successful urban development programme?') is to present the knowledge they have collected in an encompassing, systematic and concise way to all those who are, or in the future will be, involved in the conception and implementation of UDPs: Urban Development Programmes.  What should be done? What should be avoided? What is feasible? What is not? Who should be involved at what moment? What are the benefits and pitfalls of an area-based, integral approach to urban renewal? How can the sustainability of results of UDPs be improved? How to develop and use a budget? How can results be evaluated? These are some of the basic questions we will try to answer, using the experience of people in the field. What is the use of communicating experiences of different actors in different institutional contexts? In the last chapter of the 'handbook for policy-makers' , we present a final roundup in the form of a checklist, which can be used to evaluate UDPs in the stage of conception. A draft-UDP can be put to the test by answering the questions that follow. The more positive answers, the better the odds are that the UDP will be successful. If several answers are negative, there are good reasons to reconsider the UDP as it is.",0,0
942,200773,No,"Bayesian Peer Influence: Group Beliefs, Polarisation and Segregation","'The objective of this research agenda is to provide a new framework to model and analyze dynamics of group beliefs, in order to study phenomena such as group polarization, segregation and inter-group discrimination. We introduce a simple new heuristic, the Bayesian Peer Influence heuristic (BPI), which is based on rational foundations and captures how individuals are influenced by others' beliefs. We will explore the theoretical properties of this heuristic, and apply the model to analyze the implications of belief dynamics on social interactions.  Understanding the formation and evolution of beliefs in groups is an important aspect of many economic applications, such as labour market discrimination. The beliefs that different groups of people have about members of other groups should be central to any theory or empirical investigation of this topic. At the same time, economic models of segregation and discrimination typically do not focus on the evolution and dynamics of group beliefs that allow for such phenomena. There is therefore a need for new tools of analysis for incorporating the dynamics of group beliefs; this is particularly important in order to understand the full implications of policy interventions which often intend to 'educate the public'. The BPI fills this gap in the literature by offering a tractable and natural heuristic for group communication. Our aim is to study the theoretical properties of the BPI, as well as its applications to the dynamics of group behavior. Our plan is to: (i) Analyze rational learning from others’ beliefs and characterise the BPI. (ii) Use the BPI to account for cognitive biases in information processing. (iii) Use the BPI to analyze the diffusion of beliefs in social networks. (iv) Apply the BPI to understand the relation between belief polarization, segregation in education and labour market discrimination. (v) Apply the BPI to understand the relation between belief polarization and political outcomes.'",1,0
637,16961,No,Integrated Model for the Analysis of Urban Route Optimization,"The project's objective is to build a dynamic traffic test model for RTI applications in small urban areas. This will be used to test applications such as traffic information, delivery advice or ordering, route planning, route guidance systems, collision avoidance systems, incident detection, etc. The main goal of the project was to prove the feasibility of certain methodologies in the arena of transportation research. As a result of the project, pilot versions of new modelling tools and measurement techniques have been developed and experimented. The integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IMAURO) is an urban dynamical traffic assignment simulation model, sensitive to various road transport informatics (RTI) effects, able to predict and show the effects of broadcast information on travel times, traffic density and flow rates. IMAURO is conceived as an integrated tool with a modular structure: data acquisition, database and simulation model. The IMAURO project introduced innovative techniques to realise its ambitious objective of integrating 3 submodels which are responsive to road transport informatics (RTI) and which operate on different levels of network detail, thus realising a dynamic traffic simulation tool. These innovative techniques include a rule language for describing driver behaviour in an integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IRTE), a representation for the information network of the IRTE, a representation for road networks at various levels of detail, a representation for perceived sections of a road network, a method for merging and splitting vehicle packets, improved devices for automatic road data collection, a method for integrating 3 simulation submodels per time slice, and a method for showing simulation results using a graphical user interface. The resulting IMAURO implementation, which demonstrates these techniques, was shown to be adaptable to a realistic urban network, namely, the urban agglomeration of the Belgian city of Namur. Test runs, with a simple demand derived from the available data at FUNDP, have been executed with simulation of an event on a major road section alongside the river Meuse. These tests have shown that the evolution of flows and costs, for a same demand and an identical incident time and location, is different depending on the availability of RTI procuring information about the incident to the drivers. However, a real dynamical demand model for the city of Namur is not available at this time and should be used to be able to validate the models. In any case further development of the mesoscopic simulation model and of the cost model are necessary to produce a commercial product. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  A major innovation of the integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IMAURO) was the development of a rule language used to describe the behaviour of drivers in an integrated road transport environment (IRTE). The language has a friendly syntax and permits the behaviour of drivers in specific traffic scenarios to be described clearly, concisely and unambiguously. A set of such rules, constituting a behaviourial theory, may be accumulated incrementally by considering the behaviour of drivers in specific traffic scenarios. The formality of the rule language not only ensures that driver behaviour can be specified and communicated clearly between the partners, but also permits rules to be machine readable. The IMAURO project fully pursued this opportunity with the development of a software mechanism which reads and compiles the rules into code which can be integrated with the simulation submodels and which executes the specified behaviour when the specified traffic scenarios are simulated. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  PACSIM simulates movements of packets of vehicles (groups of 1 to 30 vehicles with a coherent behaviour) over a network representing a small urban area. Such packets follow routes from their origin to their destination. These routes are updated, according to the combined impact of traffic events and information technology (RTI). Packets are not static entities but do merge and split all over the network. PACSIM plays a central role for computing a dynamic assignment over the entire network. The PACSIM model includes the following desirable features: a flexible network representation, a flexible and standardised behaviourial mechanism, a behaviourally coherent traffic metaphor, an explicit time reference, and an explicit model for information flow. The PACSIM information model takes the form ofa network that features 3 main types of nodes: detectors, traffic information centres and information sockets. These 3 classes of information network nodes are themselves linked by communication lines whose reliability and delay can be parametrized. The detector's purpose is to monitor the status of the network and to detect any traffic event therein. Traffic information centres are nodes at which information on detected traffic events is centralized, screened and then distributed to other centres and information sockets. Information sockets model the various devices that are used to transmit information to network users (radio beacons and dedicated broadcastings, variable message signs, etc). They can be situated anywhere on the network. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  Within the context of the integrated model for the analysis of urban route organisation (IMAURO), MICSIM presents a moving window in the urban network with an animated graphical representation of vehicle flow. A file describing a perceived network is transferred from PACSIM to MICSIM at the point microscopic simulation should be initiated. This file effectively describes a snapshot of the PACSIM simulation on a small section of the road network which MICSIM proceeds to simulate for a short duration. A similar snapshot file is sent back to the now frozen PACSIM when the MICSIM simulation is complete. The MICSIM software managing the kinematics of car following and gap acceptance at junctions provide the bedrock of the microscopic simulation submodel. To model the influence of broadcast road transport informatics (RTI) information on the vehicles being simulated, MICSIM makes use of an identical behaviourial rule mechanism to that of PACSIM. This layer of software of higher priority is used to model the major decisions drivers may take to reroute when informed of obstacles along their preplanned route. Thus 3 major components of MICSIM can be identified: MICSIM initialisation, MICSIM basic vehicle kinematic management and the MICSIM/PACSIM behaviourial rule mechanism. The IMAURO solution is based on rapid execution of behaviourial rules which are used to specify complex behaviourial that might result for specific vehicle types in specific road situations. For sake of consistency within the IMAURO system, MICSIM uses the same rule set as PACSIM, which interprets in the same manner. However, for use within MICSIM, the rules are compiled to invoke MICSIM functions. The only difference in interpretation of the rule language for MICSIM, is that the USER denotes an individual vehicle whereas it denotes a packet within PACSIM. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  The function of TOPCOST is to compute speed flow concentration relationships, to produce the cost results, and to transfer them to other submodels by adequate interfaces. TOPCOST is constructed as a number of components, each component managing a travel cost of a particular type. TOPCOST uses a continuous traffic stream model. The maximum capacity flow is based on the principles of the American highway capacity manual (HCM) adapted for Belgian urban conditions. For roundabouts a British model is used. The fuel consumption component is a variant of one of the Australian ARFCOM models. It computes the total fuel consumption of a vehicle, as it cruises towards an intersection, decelerates to the stopline, idles, accelerates, and cruises away from the intersection. The travel time component is directly computed as the sum of cruise time and all kinds of delay. Cruise time is defined by the quotient of link length and cruise speed, which itself is obtained from the SFC model. The junction queuing component is based on a British unified Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) approach derived from probabilistic queuing theory. The discrete events component are treated by the kinematic wave approach originally conceived for traffic applications by Lighthill and Whitham. The accidents component provides a macroscopic measure of the main categories of accident costs, as far as the necessary calibration data are available. The noise component involves only the noise emission. TOPCOST estimates a weighted noise index for each link, in the middle of the link. The exhaust pollution component deals with 6 different pollutants, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide, lead components and various particles. The information cost component where road transport informatics (RTI) costs are to be payed for a service or equipment provided by a private or public company. There is room for testing the impact of 5 basic RTI techniques on cost functi ons used for route choice. The fares component simulates a cost charged by the public authorities, independently of some information service to the road user. The factors proposed to identify the value the route selection determinants of the individual's travel behaviour and of society optimum behaviour are described. TOPCOST uses 28 elementary costs on link level, which have been grouped, using a common aggregation method, into 5 impedance or objective oriented subsets, to construct 5 aggregate link functions. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92  The data necessary for the integrated model for the analysis of urban route optimisation (IMAURO) simulation models are topological and geometric data for the description of the urban road network of the selected city and real traffic data in different traffic situations for calibration purposes. Topological and geometrical data could be taken from existing maps and plans. A second part is based upon the observation of the road characteristics on site. This data includes the geometrical characteristics of the junctions and links of the network such as length, width, number of lanes, parking zones, priorities, bus stops, etc. Another part is the road equipment for traffic regulation, such as speed limits that apply, cycle time of traffic lights, possible movements at a junction, etc. The traffic data needed to calibrate a dynamic model are the flow, the classification of the vehicles, the distribution of speeds and the concentration or occupancy. The data collection methodology must be able to give figures characterising the traffic situation in a given zone of the network. Therefore different types of sensors were needed, some of them being capable of being moved and installed rapidly. 2 major types of equipment were tested, inductive loops and video based traffic sensors. A comparison of the measurements with video camera and inductive loops was completed, using as a reference some visual observations, executed by BRRC people on the same sites. The camera and loop equipment are now capable of delivering traffic data with good precision. The database representing the traffic observed at a main entry node of the central part La Corbeille in Namur, during different periods of the year and in different traffic conditions, is available for further use. A prototype was made available on 25/08/92 The output of IMAURO will be an integrated tool with a modular structure consisting of:  - a data acquisition module,  - a model construction module,  - a data base system module.  The project's data acquisition phase will collect essential `real world' data from a specific test network containing 500 km of urban roads by using modern techniques such as video camera observations & automatic image analysis, mobile measuring stations as well as other more classical data collection techniques. The data will be used in simulation testing.  In the model construction phase, a tool will be constructed which will integrate :  - a dynamic macroscopic traffic assignment using a `node environment' and limited driver knowledge of the network status (TOPSORT),  - a microscopic traffic simulation based on gap acceptance (MICSIM),  - an advanced network oriented numerical optimization technique (PSN LNO).  The techniques to be used in the macroscopic model will enable the simulation of RTI effects such as driver information systems, incident detection systems, route guidance techniques, road pricing and green waves.  The structure of the microscopic model will allow simulation of the effects of RTI, such as distance warning, overtaking aids, urban variants of convoy driving involving synchronized acceleration/deceleration phases in relation to traffic lights and other effects.  The above described dynamic traffic simulation model will not include dynamic demand forecasting or modal split models but will provide a mechanism for integration with such models, if they are developed by other DRIVE projects.  Finally the database system will be provided (including a database management subsystem) and will be used to store and retrieve data used in the models and in the interaction with the measurement work in the field. A user interface and a software interface to demand modelling tools will also be developed.  Main Deliverables:  Report on survey and data collection, Report on data base system.  Reports on final models TOPSORT, PSNLNO, MICSIM.",0,0
865,92300,No,Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation through Alternative Landuses in Rainforests of the Tropics,"The proposal addresses Topic ENV.2008.1.1.5.1 “Addressing deforestation in tropical areas: greenhouse gas emissions, socio-economic drivers and impacts, and policy options for emissions reduction”. The overall goal of the project is to contribute to the development and evaluation of mechanisms and the institutions needed at multiple levels for changing stakeholder behaviour to slow tropical deforestation rates and hence reduce GHG emissions. This will be achieved through enhancing our understanding of the social, cultural, economic and ecological drivers of forest transition in selected case study areas in Southeast Asia, Africa and South America. This understanding will facilitate the identification and assessment of viable policy options addressing the drivers of deforestation and their consistency with policy approaches on avoided deforestation, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and degradation (REDD), currently being discussed in UNFCCC and other relevant international fora. At the same time, ways of improving the spatial quantification of land use change and the associated changes in GHG fluxes will be developed, thereby improving the accounting of GHG emissions resulting from land use change in tropical forest margins and peatlands. This will allow the analysis of scenarios of the local impacts of potential international climate change policies on GHG emission reductions, land use, and livelihoods in selected case study areas, the results of which will be used to develop new negotiation support tools for use with stakeholders at international, national and local scales to explore a basket of options for incorporating REDD into post-2012 climate agreements. The project will provide a unique link between international policy-makers and stakeholders on the ground who will be required to change their behaviour regarding deforestation, thereby contributing to well-informed policy-making at the international level.",0,0
1089,52169,No,Communicating urban growth and green: assessment of planning concepts and policy instruments for sustainable development of the urban landscape,"Problems to be solved Most cities in Europe are facing the challenge to make urban green an integral part of urban growth. Steering towards a balance between urban expansion and the quality of green areas requires good governance and is sometimes highly problematic. If growth takes the form of expansion in the urban fringe, there is increased pressure of sub-urbanisation, urban sprawl and traffic on surrounding greenbelts. If there is growth in the existing city, there is the pressure of intensive use, building activities, fragmentation by roads, pollution and noise imposed on green areas and other open spaces in existing cities. In some of these open spaces, the so-called 'brownfields', pollution inherited from past industrial uses may pose difficulties to conversion for either housing or green functions. As a result there is increased pressure on the 'greenfields' in the urban fringe. In many cases, green areas become small and scattered, polluted and disturbed. Traditionally, urban growth and green are seen as competitive or even mutually exclusive. Yet cities have sometimes found ways to turn 'green fingers' or 'greenways' into the backbones of urban development. Policies and projects have been launched aiming at both sustainable economic and ecological development. The GREENSCOM project focuses on learning from success and failure of local government experiences in this context. Scientific objectives and approach: Abundant technical knowledge is available on green structures and urban open spaces, but the 'process-knowledge' of communication strategies and policy instruments often remains under explored. Learning about these aspects of governance is the central research objective of GREENSCOM. The project consists of a series of working packages that will each have a clearly circumscribed output. The outcome of the project as a whole is a toolkit. The toolkit consists of communication strategies and policy instruments recommended under specified conditions. The tools are neither 'blueprints'-nor recipes, but methods and approaches that can stimulate a deliberate process of learning by doing at the local level. The tools will be useful to those involved in governing urban growth and green at both the strategic and operational levels. The research approach leads to a project in three phases. First, relevant questions and hypotheses regarding communication and policy instruments are formulated in interaction with the cities involved. Then, a framework will be developed that allows for comparative study of cases. In the second phase, this framework is used for case studies in five European countries. The third phase is an assessment of the cases and leads to the toolkit. In all phases researchers closely work together with urban practitioners. Expected impacts At the strategic level, the toolkit facilitates 'good governance' of green structures by offering strategies to strengthen the position of green areas in conflicts with urban growth. A special focus is on strategic options for multifunctional combinations, linking green and other functions, like water storage, cycle tracks, real estate values, and urban climate. At the operational level, the research project generates a better understanding of local and generic conditions in which particular policy instruments can be successfully applied. Recommendations are made for such policy instruments as public-private partnerships, incentives and compensation practices. As communication is the central theme, communication strategies and decision-making procedures are an important field for recommendations, both at strategic and operational level. Understanding the processes and development of better tools to improve the quality of decisions on growth and green. This contributes to wider objectives of sustainable urban development and quality of life in urban areas.",0,0

680,81998,No,Evaluation of Immune responses against highly expressed tumour Antigens in non-small cell Lung Carcinoma; Prospects for Immunotherapy,"Several tumour-associated antigens have been used safely in clinical trials of therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination with modest clinical outcomes. This inability to stimulate an effective anti-tumour response could be due to the poor choice of antigens used for vaccination, necessitating an improvement and broadening of antigenic selection for cancer immunotherapy.  The over-expressed tumour-associated antigens Survivin and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TRT), are attractive because they are ubiquitously ex pressed and are required for maintenance of cancer cell growth. The immune responses against these antigens will be characterised in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Emphasis will be given to the underlying T cell response to establish whether it is of a reasonable magnitude and/or of sufficient and broad epitope specificity to overcome tumour clones that escape immune surveillance.  The specific aims will address the following: Do patients with NSCLC exhibit tumour-induced T cell responses against particular or multiple T cell epitopes present in Survivin and TRT? Does this response vary in frequency and specificity from that seen in normals? Does disease progression relate to T cell epitope spreading involving multiple HLA geno-types? Does the in situ, quantifiable detection of these antigens on tumour specimens predict disease severity?  In addressing these aims, it will be determined whether these antigens can be used as immunotherapeutic agents in NSCLC. Cancer immunotherapy directed against multiple epitopes of tumour-associated antigens may be beneficial in a broad range of cancer patients. This fellowship will enable me to become established as a scientist in a highly respected medical research institute in Greece. I will train in a stimulating environment that can only benefit my scientific aspirations. This will be a stepping- stone for my future academic career within the Hellenic and European Medical Research establishment.",0,0

295,200012,Yes,Ideas and Legitimating Discourse in EU and US Agricultural Policy-Making and their Implications for Transatlantic Trade Relations,"This project comparatively investigates divergence and convergence in agricultural policy ideas and policies in the EU and the US and their interaction with multilateral and transatlantic trade negotiations. Applying an innovative Discursive Institutionalist approach, it uncovers whether and how ideas and discourse affect processes of policy transformation. It thus contributes to an ‘ideational turn’ in the field of Agricultural Policy Studies which is currently dominated by rationalist interest-based explanations. The outcomes of this research will not only explain the dynamics of agricultural policy change and their effect on past trade negotiations, it will also provide policy makers with insights in the opportunities and limits to develop agricultural policies that are both domestically acceptable and conducive to ongoing transatlantic and international trade negotiations (e.g. TTIP and WTO). This is highly significant considering the important role of agricultural trade policies in tackling the pressing food and environmental challenges of today and tomorrow.  This GF will strengthen the relationship between EU and US agricultural policy research and will establish the fellow in a leading position in the field, simultaneously making her a valuable interlocutor for European policy actors. The project’s training activities are ultimately geared towards making the fellow eligible for a position of Associate Professor by providing a fundamental contribution to a) developing and consolidating her independent and innovative line of research in the role of ideas and discourse – ideational causation – in policy making; b) enhancing her research excellence through her publication profile, and c) forging knowledge networks bridging academia and the public policy sector, building lasting relationships for the exchange of knowledge and policy advice.",1,1
923,27052,No,"Environmental Policy, Technological Innovation and Firms' Competitiveness in Oligopolistic Industries","The project aims to describe firms' production and innovation decisions theoretically, accounting for the interdependence between firms' market strategy and governments' environmental regulation decisions. This project complements and expands the work carried out in contract no: 92 - 0159.   Attention is devoted to both the economic and technological aspects of the problem, in particular the role of environmental innovation and the nature of the 'Best Available Technology' choice. The following are addressed:   i) technological innovation by the firm and its effects on consequential environmental damage;   ii) the likelihood of polluting firm relocation as a consequence of environmental regulation;   iii) the possibility of firms' products being environmentally differentiated;   iv) the nature of the policies which integrate environmental and industrial policies in non-competitive, oligopolistic industries.   The international interaction of firms is described through the process of trade in the international goods market. The study examines the effect of unilateral and internationally coordinated environmental policy measures. The model takes account of market imperfection and informs the policy context by characterising the strategic reaction of firms (in terms of production, product differentiation, technological innovation, location, etc.) made in reaction to environmental regulation.",1,0
177,96227,Yes,Families of Inequalities- Social and economic consequences of the changing work-family equilibria in European Societies,"This project investigates social change and its correlates in European societies. In specific, the change in social and economic inequalities associated with new welfare-work-family equilibria. The Project therefore focuses on the changes in women s labour market behaviour, the interlinkage between women s employment and family decisions, families’ capacities to compensate for increasing market risks and the consequences of these developments for social and economic inequalities between families in post industrial societies over recent decades, considering the role of the different welfare and labour market arrangements and the way they evolved. It focuses on the new welfare-work-family equilibria analysing the social and economic consequences of these (dis) equilibria for European societies and their capacity to fully integrate their populations, assuring decent employment conditions, adequate social rights and full social participation. It does so in a strict international comparison, following an interdisciplinary approach between sociology, economics and demography and applying leading edge quantitative methods to adequately treat topics in life cycle perspective.",1,1
374,106043,Yes,Rethinking sources and consequences of business cycles,"'Up until 2006 most macro-economists held the view that combination of technology and monetary factors could explain the bulk of business cycles, and that overall business cycle fluctuations were not a major source of concern for policy (at least in developed economies and in the post-war).  The 2007-2009 crisis and its aftermath has radically shaken this view. First, most industrialized countries have experienced the largest and more synchronized downturn since the great depression and neither productivity nor monetary factors seem to have played a major role in it. Second the downturn has left profound scars on developed economies, in particular it has left a combination of high unemployment, large fiscal deficits, sluggish and unbalanced growth which are causing serious social discomfort together with political and international instability. The goal of this proposal is to better understand causes and consequences of the crisis. I intend to work on the 6 specific projects outlined below. All 6 projects are empirically motivated by the great depression and surrounding events, and all projects try to draw relevant policy implications from the analysis.  On the causes of the 2007-2009 crisis: i) Wealth and volatility. The project explores the role of self-fulfilling demand crises as a drivers of business cycles. Main finding is that situation in which asset prices (in particular housing prices) are low makes the economy more vulnerable to these crises. ii) Spatial Business Cycles. Project shows that increase in unemployment did not hit all US counties at the same time but rather started in few counties and over time spread to neighbouring areas. We draw lessons for the importance of housing prices and other local factors in causing, transmitting and amplifying fluctuations. iii) Dealing with International Financial Distress. Early work has shown that financial shocks can cause global decline and that they can emerge endogenously as confidence crisis in the global market for asset of defaulting firms. This project asks whether and how policies can avoid these confidence crises, keeping into account that policies of liquidity provision might increase risk taking. iv) The international China Syndrome. The project explores the role of new emerging manufacturing powerhouses such as India or China on macroeconomic performance of developed economies both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view.  On the consequences of the 2007-2009 crisis i) Inequality and the Great Recession. Project analyzes the distributional impact of the crisis and of the persistent unemployment in the US, using data on inequality in income, hours, wealth and consumption over the period 2005-2011. ii) Understanding the Euro debt crisis of 2011. This project uses a standard model of international limited risk sharing to assess whether the recent surge in sovereign spread paid by many European countries can be explained by macro fundamentals.'",1,1
234,111238,Yes,Creating Economic Space for Social Innovation,"The CRESSI project will explore the economic underpinnings of social innovation with a particular focus on how policy and practice can enhance the lives of the most marginalized and disempowered citizens in society. Overall, the bid will take an institutionalist view of the key issues exploring the drivers and structures that lead to marginalization and disempowerment and then setting out how interventions drawing on social innovation can address major economic, social and power imbalances and inequalities. The project draws upon three interlinked strands of theory to provide an overarching conceptual framework: Beckert’s social grid model; Sen’s Capabilities Approach; Mann’s analysis of institutional power structures and their enactments. The main work packages will focus on: establishing an economic theory and context for social innovation across the EU; contextualizing social innovation within established research and practice on technological innovation; exploring emergent social innovation ecosystems and lifecycles; setting out effective policy agendas and instruments for fostering social innovation; establishing best practice metrics for capturing the impact of social innovation. In addition, discrete work packages will focus on the overall management of the project and the dissemination of its key findings and contributions. The conceptual and theoretical elements of the project will be tested and revised with a rigorous programme of empirical data collection encompassing qualitative case studies and linked quantitative analyses with a focus on key topic areas across several member states that can inform the EU Commission debates on building smart economies that reduce inequality and socio-economic marginalization.",1,1
1048,220912,No,"Addressing Global Challenges through International Scientific Consortia (INSCONS); Case studies in biomedicine, the geosciences, and nuclear fusion research","INSCONS is a groundbreaking, large-scale examination of the organisational dynamics of international scientific consortia (ISCs) and the interactions of these consortia with broader scientific communities, national bureaucracies, and industry. ISCs are very complex organisations with work being carried out at geographically dispersed sites, and involving international stakeholder groups from across the realms of science, policy, and industry. As these ISCs are becoming more important in efforts to address global challenges in areas such as health, the environment, and clean energy, our understanding of the distinctive organizational dynamics governing these consortia has lagged behind. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for novel organisational theory and frameworks that will advance our understanding of ISCs. INSCONS is an ambitious effort to address this need, using a comparative, interdisciplinary approach. Three case studies of large, international ISCs in nuclear fusion research, biomedicine, and the geosciences are at the core of INSCONS. The INSCONS project will examine four aspects of these ISCs. It will 1) Map the internal organisational dynamics of ISCs using interviews, bibliometric network analyses, and ethnographic field studies on everyday work in ISCs. 2) It will study ISCs’ interactions with the broader scientific community by conducting a survey among researchers in the scholarly fields ISCs operate in, and by analysing these fields’ co-authorship networks. 3) It will examine the (inter)national political processes and bureaucratic wrangling shaping ISCs. 4) It will examine relationships of dependency and influence between ISCs and industry through case studies as well as analyses of patenting and publication activities. Taken together, the project outputs of INSCONS will bring into clear focus the sociology and politics, as well as the operational complexities that govern this important, new organisational form in contemporary science.",0,0
102,87454,Yes,Financial Services Governance in the European Union,"This project examines the governance of financial services in the European Union (EU). This research is both academically interesting and policy relevant. Academic research has not kept pace with new developments in this field, and interdisciplinary research is very much needed, as financial services governance is at the cross road between politics, economics and law. At the practical level, the financial sector is a core part of national economies and one of the most active areas of EU policy making. Moreover, this research will contribute to informing the public discussion in a policy area that is often perceived as 'technical', which tends to limit the public scrutiny of it. For the purposes of this research, the governance of financial services in the EU includes: i) the institutional framework through which policies are made; ii) regulation, which is comprised of market-making and market-framing measures; and iii) supervision, that is: the monitoring and enforcement of regulation as well as the practical cooperation between supervisory authorities. First, the project will map the complex institutional framework underpinning financial services governance in the EU, explaining how such framework interplays with regulatory and supervisory arrangements in international arenas and in selected countries. Second, through competitive hypotheses testing, the project will analyse the EU policy-making processes in the financial sector: the main policy-makers and stakeholders involved; their resources, relationships and influence on the policy process; and the outcome. Besides contributing to the policy-oriented debate on financial services regulation and supervision in the EU, the ultimate theoretical goal of the research is to devise an integrated analytical framework that by combining various theoretical approaches and identifying their scope conditions could account for financial services governance in the EU, advancing theories of EU policy making.",0,1
262,218765,Yes,Growth Welfare Innovation Productivity,"Well before the Great Recession, the strikingly successful socio-economic regime of growth of the three decades after WWII came to an end as the smooth matching among technological innovation, productivity growth, income distribution and aggregate demand increasingly broke down. However, a new virtuous regime is hardly emerging and growth of income and productivity remains sluggish especially in Europe. The project is meant to investigate the causes of the slowdown and to propose an integrated policy package able to sustain an inclusive and welfare-enhancing process of growth resilient to climate change and population aging. In some respects, the proposal represents the deepening of the ‘diagnostic exercise’ we have undertaken in a very successful H2020 project: ISIGrowth http://www.isigrowth.eu/. In many others it extends the scope of the investigation, fully addressing the whole thread of the interaction among innovation, productivity, and growth in a world possibly undergoing a' IV Industrial Revolution', wherein globalization exacerbated the diverging patterns of value distribution among countries and social groups. Together, it will thoroughly study the effects of monetary, fiscal and mission-oriented policies in stimulating productivity and output growth. The team comprises leading international scholars ranging from economics of innovation, industrial dynamics, econometrics, agent-based macroeconomics, and public governance. Crucially a group of National Statistical Offices will join the research, also developing new data and measurements. The policy recommendations will be grounded on solid micro-, meso- and macro analyses, always accounting for the feedbacks between Schumpeterian (supply side) dynamics and Keynesian (demand side) ones. The relevance and adequacy of the proposed policies will be continuously challenged by the interaction with a whole set of stakeholders belonging to European Institutions, civil society, and business.",1,1
1081,4446,No,"Safety assessment of the deliberate release of two model transgenic crop plants, oilseed rape and sugar beet","The objective is to study of the dispersal of genes via genetic engineering into plants under common agricultural situations in the field. New techniques, assays and probes for the quick and efficient tracking of the transgenes in seeds and plants will be developed.  During the Biotechnology Action Programme (BAP) project Study of gene dispersal from plants by recombinant DNA technology characteristic features of small scale releases were identified. At a small scale (which in many cases is related to the first introduction and early development of a genetically modified plant) the experimenter may still include a number of redundant safeguards in the design and carry out detailed monitoring.  As the product development evolves, the surface and scope of the experiments imply larger areas that do no longer entail some of the earlier protection measures, for example including a broader strip of 5 m of nonmodified control plants around a large area proves to be costly and probably inadequate.  Research has been carried out into the evaluation of pollen dispersal in nonconfined releases. The dynamics of pollen movement was studied from fields that have no additional safety features and are comparable to good agricutural practice. One source field was planted with genetically modified plants, carrying an easily recognizable tracer and catcher fields were distributed in the surrounding area. Posttrial evaluation was carried out in the progeny of the catcher fields and the amount of out crossing combined with pollen transport was calculated and fitted in experimental models.  The first results obtained during 2 years of field trials with different field designs, the specifics of each design as well as the problems encountered during the trial will be discussed in a posttrial evaluation and a design will be proposed that will be the key element in a multilocation evaluation to be carried out.  Prior to the cultivation of transgenic plants by farmers, the risk of releasing such plants in open fields needs to be assessed. Research has been carried out in order to estimate the possibility of transfer of an herbicide resitance gene from a genetically modified Brassica napus to different wild speices by cross hybridization. Production of F1 hybrids by manual pollination involved reciprocal interspecific crosses between a transformed rapeseed resistant to Basta and 5 wild species. Most of the hybrids showed a triploid structure, except for 3 amphidiploids. Chromosome pairing and dertility of the hybrids were assessed. Presence of the gene in the hybrid genome was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its expression controlled in vivo by a resistance test. When the gene was present, it was expressed in all but 2 plants.  F1 hybrids were produced by spontaneous pollination, using fertile transgenic rapeseed. Wild species (Sinapis arvensis, Raphanus raphanistrum) were grown in insect free cages in mixture with gransgenic Basta resistant oilseed rape, in the presence of a bee hive. Only S arvensis seeds were analysed for Basta resistance. No hybrid was found. Spontaneous pollination using male sterile rapeseed involved sowing nontransgenic male sterile rapeseeds in alternative rows with wild species (B adpressa, R raphanistrum). Fertility and chromosome number of the hybrids were assessed.  Backcrosses (BC) on the hybrids from manual pollination have been carried out. Using embryo rescue, number of BC1 obtained ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 plants per 100 cultivated ovaries. No seed was obtained on the amphidiploids after BC, except with B oleracea. Selfing of the B napus x B oleracea amphidiploids gave 8.3 to 9.9 seeds per pod. Chromosome number and fertility of the BC1 were assessed. PCR and in vivo tests revealed that when the gene is present in the BC1, it is expressed. For 1 plant the gene was lost. With respect to spontaneous pollination, hybrids bewee n male sterile or transgeic rapeseed and S arvensis, R raphanistru, B adpressa were grown with the corresponding wild species in insect free cages. 1, 10 and 272 seeds were harvested on the hybrids respectively. Morphology of the BCs obtained was intermediary between the wild and the crop parents. Hybrids between male sterile rapeseed and wild species (B adpressa, R raphanistrum) were sown on alternative rows with the corresponding wild species. Work is in progress to characterize fertility, chromosome number, presence and expression of the Basta resistance gene on the BC1 obtained.  Accurate prediction of the level of gene expression in transgenic plants is a major requirement for assessing thebiosafety of such plants. The variability in transgene expression between individual transgenic plants carrying the same transgene(s) is enormous and is thought to be caused by the random place of integration of the transgene in the plant genome. This position effect is severely hampering both biosafety analyses of transgenic plants as well as studies into the regulation of gene activity.  Gene expression is thought to involve the formation of chromatin loops that are bound to the nuclear scaffold by scaffold attachment sites (SAR). In animal systems, the addition of SAR sequences has been shown to decrease the variability of gene expression. It is assumed that SAR sequences render the introduced genes less dependent upon the particular place of integration. Recently, plant SAR sequences. Also, a decrease of variability of reporter gene expression was suggested in plant callus. The addition of SAR sequences may therefore contribute to a higher predictability of transgene expression.  Using chicken (A element), a series of plant vectors carrying these SAR sequences around the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene have been constructed. To investigate the influence of SAR sequences on gene expression during plant development, the reporter gene was driven by the light regulated promoter from the potato 1haC gene. This gene encodes a protein of the light harvesting complex of Photosystem I. Transgenic tobacco plants were obtained using Agrobacterium mediated leaf disc transformation and were analyzed for GUS activity in the leaves.  The presence of the A element resulted in a significantly higher overall GUS activity, depending on the distance between A element and reporter gene, indicating an enhancer effect of the A element.  No obvious reduction in variability of GUS activity was observed. The distribution of gene expression over the population wa s markedly skewed and different from the normal distribution, so most statistical tests for variance were inappropriate. Using nonparametric tests, the 3 populations were compared with respect to distribution and variance of gene expression. Whereas the distribution of gene expression is significantly altered as a result of the presence of A elements, any reduction of the variability in gene expression was more difficult to approach statistically.  Several experiments and surveys concerning the ecological effect of growing glyphosate tolerant sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) have been conducted during the growth season of 1991 and 1992. The following subjects have been studied: pollen disperal from sugar beet to wild relatives; competitive ability of the glyphosate tolerant beet; observations of Beta maritima on 4 wild habitats describing flowering period and phenological diversity; analysis of the weed beet population in Danish beet fields, origin, ploidy, phenological diversity and seed production.  Pollen dispersal from Beta vulgaris to wild relatives: 1 pollination experiment with Beta maritima was conducted in a beet field. Red beet (Beta vulgaris variety condivita) was used as a marker plant to simulate outcrossing from a transgenic diploid sugar beet variety. Beta maritima was planted varying distances from a red beet pollen source. 5 smaller experiments have been conducted all with red beet as the pollen source and 3 different wild beet species (Beta atriplicifolia, B macrocarpa and B maritima) as receptor plants.  Competitive ability of the glyphosate tolerant beet: The competitive ability of an ordinary sugar beet variety was measured relative to 2 other agricultrual crops, barley (Hordeum vulgare), and flax (Linum usitatissimum). The cross between a transgenic sugar beet and a Beta maritima have been tested against the parental types in a field trial.  Observations of Beta maritima on 4 wild habitats, concerning flowering period and phenological diversity: A morphological survey of Beta maritima was conducted on 5 isolated coast lines on the western part of Sealand, Denmark, to establish knowledge of flowering and genetic diversity. The populations were surveyed 4 times during the growth season.  Analysis of the weed beet population in Danish beet fields, origin, ploidy, phenological diversity and seed production: During the growth season 5 different sugar beet fields, all severley infest ed with weed beets were observed. The origin of the weed beets was examined by isoenzyme analysis and phenological observations, while ploidy was examined by flow cytometrical methods. All weed beets were diploid.  The transfer of introduced genes to wild relatives is one of the questions raised by the use of genetically modified sugar beet. While the significance of such a gene transfer must be evaluated on a gene by gene basis, a study of gene transfer using a genetic markers can provide useful information on sugar beet pollen movement and hybridization with related species under field conditions.  The first field experiment with flowering transgenic sugar beet was conducted in Belgium in 1991. The objective of the study was to test experimental protocols designed to study sugar beet pollen movement and hybridizations with Beta maritima. The pollen source was a sugar beet breeding line, containing genes for both Roundup tolerance and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity. Pollen movement was monitored by the use of single row plots of male sterile Beta vulgaris plants planted downwind form the pollen source, at distance of 25, 50 and 75 m. Mixtures of Beta maritima genotypes were planted in 5 directions at the same distance as the male sterile Beta vulgaris. Plants were harvested individually and analysed. Germination levels were generally low, and 3250 GUS assays were performed in total.  The analyses indicated that expression of GUS in the segregating pollen source was 57%, lower than the expected maximum or 75%, possibly because of hybridization with the nontransgenic segregants. On the CMS plants at distance zero, 48% of the germinating seeds were GUS positive (50% expected). The comparable frequency of outcrossing decreased with distance from the transgenic pollen source, to 14%, 5% and 3% of the germinated seeds at distances of 25, 50 and 75 m respectively. The level of germination of seeds harvested for Beta maritima plants was extremely low. Of more than 15 000 seeds harvested at distances of greater than 25 m, some 1000 seeds germinated. Only 2 of these seeds were confirmed to be GUS positive; 1 located at 25 m from the pollen source and the other at 75 m.  One of the main problems that might arise from the release of genetically modified crops is the accidental integration of the resistant gene into the genome of wild relatives. These plants could then become resistant weeds in the field.  Computer simulations have been used to compare the risks of resistance disperal and gene transfer for a large range of resistant crops differing in their biological behaviour and for 3 resistance genetic determinisms. To study the effect of each parameter of the model on the short term and the long term, the frequency of resistant weeds was noted in the field and the field margin after 5 years and after equilibrium. The goal of the model is to estimate what mechanisms and parameters influence most the escape of the gene. The results provide information on the most risky situations and point out the most valuable experiments for risks assessment. The most intuitive result provided by the model is that the parameter which controls the possibility of hybridization between wild and cultivated plants has an opistatic effect over all ther other parameters. For nearly any set of parameters the resistance will be absent in the wild populationif the hybridization between the 2 species is very low. The effect of the genetic determinism of the resistance, of a genetic linkage between domestication characteristics and the resistance and of biological characterics of the plant were also studied.  The model also points out that complex interactions between parameters may exist. As a consequence, it will be impossible to make predictions for a 'new' resistant crop whose biological behaviour differs from already studied species, until many parameters have been precisely evaluated. For this reason experimental work and modelling both profit from being done simultaneously.  The environment consequence of releasing transgenic plants to unconfined conditions depends on the changes in survival rate, growth behaviour and hybridization possibilites caused by the transformation allowing the transformed plant to invade new habitats. Although this is unlikely it is thought that impoved competitiveness of the transgenic plant may facilitate a change in mixed populations towards the transgenic genotype. An assessment of growth behaviour and competitiveness under a range of growth conditions should quantify the extent to which the transformation has changed important characters.  Sugar beets (Beta vulgaris subspecies vulgaris) are grown in all parts of Denmark, in a total area of approximately 170 000 ha 66 000 ha for sugar production and 104 000 ha for fodder use. On the coastlines of the central parts of Denmark the wild relative of sugar beet, Beta vulgaris subspecies maritima, has its natural habitat. The cultivated sugar beet is not found on these coast areas or any other natural habitats in Denmark. In the cultivated fields wild types are occasionally found. It is believed that these wild types may consist of crossings between the cultivated and the wild genotypes, as subspecies vulgaris and subspecies maritima hybridize easily.  A competition experiment involved 3 Beta subspecies: hybrids between transgenic subspecies vulgaris and nontransformed subspecies maritima, nontransformed subspecies vulgaris and nontranformed subspecies maritima. These were planted in binary combinations in greenhouse and field trials. Each of the 3 species combinations consisted of 11 different density combinations, with 3 monocultures of each subspecies and 5 mixed populations. All combinations were harvested at 4 different harvest times both in the greenhouse and in the field. A competition model that characterizes the yield potential and plant weight at low densities, as well as a relative measure of competitiveness of the genotype compared to that of the 2 other genotypes were used to quanfity the growth behaviour and competitiveness of all 3 subpecies. The experiment concurrently illustrates the dynamics of the above parameters over time.  The environmental consequence of releasing trangenic plants to unconfined conditions depends on the changes in survival rate, growth behaviour and hybridization possibilities caused by the transformation. Survival rate depends on the growth conditions and the competiveness of the plant determine the success as an invader. Fundamental changes in growth behaviour may allow the plant to invade new habitats not formerly occupied by the nontransformed genotype, but more likely, the growth behaviour is only slightly modified and the tranformed plant is limited to the same habitats as the nontransformed genotypes. An assessment of stress tolerance towards limiting growth factors is important in the understanding of the observed difference in resource uptake and allocation within and between different genotypes in mixed populations. Sugar beet, Beta vulgaris, was used as a model plant, and the behaviour of different subsepecies and hybrids were related to well known crop plants such as barley, Hordeum vulgare, and oilseed rape, Brassica napus.  The following Beta subspecies and hybrids were used to assess stress tolerance: transgenic sugar beet (subspecies vulgaris), nontransformed subspecies vulgaris, nontransformed wild beets (subspecies maritima) and hybrids between transgenic subspecies vulgaris and nontransformed subspecies maritima. The Beta subspecies, barley and oilseed rape were grown under optimal growth conditions in greenhouse. Additional to this optimal treatment all genotypes were grown under suboptimal light conditions and suboptimal temperatures. The experiment included 4 harvest times with 2 weeks intervals. The differences in stress tolerance from this experiment will be related to the growth behaviour and competitiveness of the same species and genotypes.  In 1992 it was not possible to test transgenic plants in natural habitats in Denmark. 2 locations of natural habitats with wild Beta subspecies were used to test the establishment, growth behaviour and survival of transplanted nontransformed Beta subspecies, from the preliminary trial will be used in 1993 to perform experiments including transgenic plants. The participants assess the entire range of safety issues associated with the deliberate release in the environment of genetically modified plants (GMP), specifically, two model crop species, oilseed rape and sugarbeet.   In addition to earlier defined aspects in a number of BAP-projects - pollen dispersal and outcrossing to wild relatives - descriptions are provided on seed dispersal, population dynamic behavior of GMP, hybridity and viability of outcrosses, the stability of GMP and the evolution of the expression of the transgenes over generations and time.   The main assessments are performed in the field under natural agricultural conditions. Suitable general procedures and techniques are evaluated and the globalization of the defined parameters is achieved in a definition of a safety prediction model, relating laboratory, greenhouse and field data.",0,0
908,64859,No,Diffuse emission reduction from open wastewater pits via a biologically active floating covering,"Scientific objectives and approach:  The R&D programme for EMRED project has got 5 Work Packages (A - E) each resulting in key deliverables: The 'Specification' workpackage (A) provides the users' demands and requirements to be accounted for in the design of the system (B) and the lab tests (C). The 'Lab-scale Development' workpackage (B) provides the approved components of the system, like selected filter materials and helophyta species. This workpackage provides EMRED prototype for the use in the partner SMEs process chains, with the selected measurement procedure and reference and standard data implemented into its hard- and software. In the 'Lab tests' workpackage (C) the prototype are tested on lab scale to develop an improved and tested prototype. In the 'Field tests' workpackage (D) the prototypes are installed and operated in the user SMEs' production lines. The aim is to adapt and optimise the system according to each users' requirements, and to evaluate and assess its functionality under the rough production conditions. Finally an adapted and optimised demonstration prototype equipped with a Technical Manual, and a marketing strategy is provided.  Problems to be solved:  Diffuse emissions of gaseous compounds from storage processes of liquid wastes are a theoretically recognised but practically a few addressed environmental problem. These emissions earn local recognition as they are responsible for intense odour problems and complaints of residents. Although thematic programs of the European Union focus on a more complex consideration of diffuse emissions (the chapter 'Combating of diffuse pollution' in the program 'Environment and Sustainable Development'), no over-regional efforts to reduce diffuse air pollution from storage processes are to be seen in practise. The liberation of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide are not under the legislator's control and odour emissions are of local concern only. Consequently, thousands of open wastewater storage tanks and basins in multiple industrial branches (for example in agro-food processing and petrol refining), animal slurry lagoons, denitrification basins in wastewater treatment plants, seep water pits and channels in landfills and composting facilities emit methane, dinitrogen oxide as well as volatile odorous metabolites of anaerobic decomposition processes and diminish air quality in housing and recreational areas. More than 37% of the annual European methane emission originate from waste storage and waste water treatment (EAE Technology Environment, 1998, Options to reduce Methane emissions). Many European companies storing wastewater in non-aerated ponds and tanks are small-sized (with less than 50 employees) and do not have the economic capacities to invest in high-tech wastewater treatment facilities or in process-integrated technologies for wastewater avoidance or recycling of valuable water constituents. Even though the aim of the European IPPC regime (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, 1996) is to achieve preventing or, where that is not practical, to reduce emissions into air, water and land, those companies do not dispose about the financial means to use Best Available Techniques (BAT) to prevent or minimise polluting emissions or to apply Best Management Practices (BMP) for waste water treatment which are currently discussed in the EU. On the other hand, if those companies are forced by regional authorities to reduce their odour emissions resulting from wastewater storage, their business can be endangered by high investment and maintenance costs for conventional odour prevention technologies. Many existing emission reduction methods have serious economic and operational drawbacks limiting their application and an universal solution functioning under versatile technical conditions is hardly to find. Thus, there is a demand for innovative solutions.  Expected Impacts:  During the EMRED project a new universally applicable technology for emission reduction from open wastewater basins consisting in floating filter systems will be developed. The implementation of the EMRED system in wastewater storage facilities will contribute to solving environmental problems caused by odour and greenhouse gas emissions from liquid waste storage and will increase the acceptance of the concerned companies by neighbours and environmental authorities. In fact, the system will decrease diffuse emissions from liquid waste water storage by 80% in case of odour and at least 30 % in case of methane emission. Furthermore, increased employment through EMRED system manufacture and installation is expected.",0,0
332,210036,Yes,"Inequality, urbanization and Territorial Cohesion: Developing the European Social Model of economic growth and democratic capacity (COSHMO)","The principal aim of COHSMO is to investigate the relation between socio-economic structures of inequality, urbanization and territorial cohesion, and how territorial cohesion at different European scales affect economic growth, spatial justice and democratic capacities. The way that public, private and civil society stakeholders counter or cushion spatial injustice varies across localities in Europe. In common, is the need to develop the institutional capacities for place-based collaboration and democratically mobilize communities for policy development and adaption. Although location and place have gained attention in European policy and the theoretical thinking informing regional development policies, it is argued in COHSMO that we need to change our orientation in the direction of making place-informed theories and policies instead of applying existing theories and policies on places. This will be done by providing a cross-case analysis and assessment of territorial cohesion within three different cases in each of the seven national partner contexts based on a mixed-method and locality-sensitive approach. The fieldwork will focus firstly on the relation between policy instruments and local experiences of territorial cohesion, and secondly on how “social investment strategies” relate to territorial cohesion and local conditions. Moreover, the project engages in an assessment of spatial development policies at different governance scales to map the impact of different policy instruments in the fight against spatial inequality and spatial injustice. COHSMO is innovative in its differentiated approach to how location matters, and coupled with its conceptual advances COHSMO will develop groundbreaking policy recommendations in relation to sustainable economic growth, spatial justice and democratic capacity. Because they stem from location-sensitive and cross-contextual research, such recommendations will make it possible to develop the European Social Model.",1,1

Without technology and innovation, industrialisation will not happen, and without industrialisation, development will not happen. Artificial Intelligence can be considered as the driving force of today’s industrial process and of development in general. SMEs that engage in industrial processing and manufacturing are the most critical for the early stages of industrialisation and are typically the largest job creators. They make up over 90 per cent of business worldwide and account for between 50-60 per cent of employment. However, in EU, AI has not been widely adopted by SMEs for many reasons:  INNAAS has identified an Enterprise Software market’s niche currently not covered by traditional Analytics and Business Intelligence Software Vendors: fast deployment of end-to-end Artificial Intelligence (AI) Services for small and medium enterprises. These solutions could be used for instantly deployment of data-driven services that improve process and people’s daily routine: from sales support to diseases monitoring leveraging insights prediction and insights generation across a wide range of business processes.  INNAAS have developed an end-to-end technology platform (INNAAS Fast-AI Platform) that enables Enterprises to quickly deploy turn-key Artificial Intelligence-driven digital services. The potential use cases of the platform are multiple and range from the national spending review control to the smart mobility and Industry 4.0.

OBJECTIVES:  To explore the social organization of environmental research programmes at national and European levels, their different traditions, priorities and methods for achieving policy relevance and interdisciplinarity.  DESCRIPTION:  The project focuses on the following:   i) the nature of networks among social science researchers on the environment, and their links with environmental policy.  ii) the role of users and beneficiaries of social science research on the environment in influencing the development of research programmes and policies.  The project investigates what is distinctively `European' and what is `national' about research into environmental issues. It explains the contexts out of which environmental research develops, and the policy environments in which such knowledge is used. Six countries with markedly different research and policy cultures are studied (UK, Finland, The Netherlands, Austria, Greece, Spain).  A history of specific research programmes is documented from written and oral sources and analytical distinctions are drawn between different kinds of research. Specific research projects are also examined and a comparison is conducted between national and European research networks. The methodology puts special emphasis on the involvement of research users through interviews and workshops.  The project highlights the role of specific expertise in social science research on the environment, and the development of Europe-wide research networks in influencing the shape of future European environmental policy.",0,0
600,4236,No,DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A DESIGN-SUPPORT METHODOLOGY FOR TOOL LOGISTICSYSTEMS,"The objectives of the Project is to develop a methodology to design tool logistics (storage, transportation and handling) systems for automated industrial shop-floor.  Within the problem of the materials handling, tool logistics calls for a support system to rationalize and speed-up the design phase and to improve the quality of the results.  During the project runtime, a methodology for the design of tool logistics systems was developed based on the rationalisation of the industrial partners' experience in automated manufacturing plant design. In parallel, a classification of the architectures and the dynamic behaviour of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and Flexible Transfer Lines (FTL) enabled the consortium to specify a Dynamic Plant Model. It represents plant structures, relations and significant static and dynamic attributes. Subsequent to the development of an event-driven Simulator, various editors for layout and production requirements and modifications, and a Decision Kernel, these modules were integrated together with the Dynamic Plant Model into the Tool Logistic Design Support System (TL-DSS). It enables the TLS designer to evaluate the complete FMS or FTL with realistic production scenarios. The Project will first focus on identification of a suitable Knowledge base on the basis of the application experience of the industrial Partners involved, and with particular reference to the automotive industry's environment.  Secondly, a design methodology will be developed, based on a problem-solving procedure which will combine heuristics and analytical models to handle the relevant design inputs (plant lay-out and strategic, production requirements).  Finally, the formulated methodology will be implemented in a prototypical expert-type design support systems, incorporating simulation capabilities.  The system will be validated and assessed through full-sale software implementation in the technical design department of the industrial Partners.   TLS being an integral part of FMS or FTL, must comply with all the requirements and constraints of the manufacturing system as a whole.   -production  -technology  -physical structure of the system  -economy  - operative reliability;  -flexibility, in the sense that the system can easily shift from a productive situation to another with the minimum set-up time/costs.   These requirements are often contradictory and the trade-off among them, which is the basis for the specification/design of the TLS, is very complex.   In order to address this trade-off problem from a comprehensive point of view, a proper industrial application environment has to be selected; this project will deal with the automotive industry environment, including the following :   - different production strategies;  - high variety of pieces/components to be manufactured.",0,0

This fresh approach will be used to analyze the roles of four main welfare institutions—namely the state, the family, the market, and local actors in the distribution of welfare shaped by the intersections of age, class, gender, and race relations in Europe.  In order to achieve this overall objective, the following three specific objectives will be important in this project. First, this project aims to develop a new approach in welfare state and social policy studies to understand the distribution of welfare that is shaped by the intersections of age, class, gender, and race relations. Second, by comparing different societies, it is aimed to analyze future social, economic, and demographic challenges to the welfare regimes particularly with reference social inequalities. Third, it aims to reassess welfare regime typology and examine the question of path dependency of welfare policies. The methodology to be used in analyzing the welfare of the old in the various regimes depends on quantitative and qualitative secondary data and previous studies on welfare states and social policies. Since this is a cross-national research, mostly comparative data on social policies, social welfare, and demographic indicators will be used from the EuroStat and other data resources which provide comparative data for researchers.'",1,0

Since the mid-Victorian era, competitive sport has been a tool of diplomacy and cultural imperialism within the British Empire. The significance of sporting relations increased after the Second World War as Britain sought to maintain close ties with its former colonies and dominions, especially through the game of cricket and events like the Olympic and Empire Games (later renamed as Commonwealth Games). This project intends to explore the organisation and the public's response to sport between England (Britain for some sports) and India in bilateral and multinational tournaments as a specific form of diplomatic and cultural encounter between the two countries. Two of its main objectives are to examine: (i) what the synergy between national governments and non-state actors such as sport associations reveals about sport as a tool of public diplomacy; (ii) the extent to which the British and India media produced colonial hierarchies of race, ethnicity, gender and class in their representation of sportspersons and spectators; and (iii) how nationalism and national identity was mobilised as a postcolonial strategy of building spectator support for sport teams. It will draw upon archival sources from the UK and India related to cricket, hockey, tennis, badminton, and the Olympic and Commonwealth Games.",0,0

At all stages the needs of consumer and European industry will be considered. The project will develop new innovative mathematical modelling tools that combine food quality and safety together with energy, environmental and economic aspects to predict and control food quality and safety in the cold chain. The FRISBEE partners will develop new and emerging refrigeration technologies providing energy efficient and sustainable alternatives to current technologies. The project is constructed around 8 work packages. Management is covered in work package 1. Work package 2 will develop innovative databases of current technologies to enable later comparison between new and current technologies. Work package 3 will develop Quality and Energy/Environment Assessment Tools (QEEAT). In work packages 4 and 5 the team will develop new and emerging refrigeration technologies for representative cold chains selected for applicability to the European food industry.

421,42656,No,National identity and immigrants in Southern Europe - the role of public discourse,"Research objectives and content  The current decade has been characterized by a significant increase in immigration towards the European Union and in particular towards its southern Members, namely Greece, Italy and Spain. A large part of the newcomers, although illegal, have already settled down in these countries. Moreover, xenophobic attitudes have risen, in Greece and Italy in particular, while ethnic or racial discrimination has become increasingly common. Research on these new migratory trends has to date concentrated on immigration control rather than integration. In particular, little attention has been paid to the relationship-between national identity and the development of xenophobic or discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants. This research project will examine the role that public discourse plays in fostering this type of attitudes and behavior. The analysis will concentrate on the role that policy actors discourse plays in emphasizing the distinction between 'us' (nationals) and 'them' (foreigners immigrants). The implications of discriminatory public discourse for immigrant acceptance and integration will be discussed.

451,45724,No,Automated inspection and maintenance of steel structures,"Task 1 of the AIMS Project 'The feasibility of high volume surface preparation methods has recommended to the Partners that two main methods of surface preparation are pursued. These are water-jetting and dry blasting as these methods outperformed the others tested, although sponge jetting also proved to be effective. These are the methods used in Task 3. An investigation into the surface cleanliness and the subsequent performance of the replacement protective coating has shown that these methods are successful in achieving a sound repair. There are current standards available for both of the recommended methods but advice into their reformulation was carried into Task 2.  Task 2: On the completion of Task2, know-how towards the commercial realization of two non-destructive testing devices has been established. The first of these is a device which uses an image processing based system for classification of corroded steel plate. It can also be used to determine whether steel has been cleaned to the current ISO standard. Its neural network support will allow operation according to existing Visual Standards or higher resolution classification on a new 'standard exposure time' basis. The second device uses ultra-sound excited, lockin thermography to detect hidden defects and corrosion through coatings on steel work. This allows for location of defects and subsequently patch repair of the structure realizing substantial savings in the Industry.  Task 3: At the conclusion of the AIMS project Task 3 entitled 'RECONFIGURABLE SURFACE RESTORATION TOOL CONCEPTS AND MECHANISMS' has resulted in the enabling technology for the further development of a flexible tool system for restoration of steel structures. This tool has the following capabilities: -Suitable for use with either water jet blasting or dry blasting processes; -Able to position the blasting nozzle with the optimal distance and orientation for restoration with respect to the steel surface for both wet and dry blasting processes based on the optimal process parameters found by calibration; -Suitable for interfacing to an automated blasting solution based on the commercial robot control system KRC2 from Kuka Robots in Augsburg, Germany and for use in semi-automated system; -Offer local pollution containment capabilities.  Moreover know-how in the following areas have been established: -Optimal process parameters for wet and dry blasting for steel surface restoration; -Quantitative data on the capabilities of a local pollution containment device for the tool system. A prototype experimental tool has been tested and evaluated and local containment device has been tested.  Task 4: The conclusion of the AIMS project Task 4 entitled 'TOOL DELIVERY SCENARIOS' has resulted in the enabling technology for the evaluation of different equipment, operation and access scenarios. Simulations of the restoration process have been developed for the purposes of marketing, restoration concepts and equipment evaluation and ultimately for planning purposes. The result comprise a library of CAD models of typical restoration structures and access solutions and animated models of the tools and the tool handling systems, demonstrating the control simulation.  Task 5: The following goals of the AIMS project Task 5 entitled ' CONTROL CONCEPTS FOR AN AUTOMATED MAN-MACHINE SYSTEM ' have been met: -A definition of global and local environments for planning, modelling, and control; -Local work cycle definition including target collision detection and easy control; -Incorporation of sensors into the control system; -A simple Human-machine interface.  The industrial robot controller KRC1 with an attached robot system KR125 has been used as target platform. Using its PC base, both partners, ISW and KUKA have been able to perform implementations for the system and work effectively. For the use of a robot in the target environment, a collision detection concept has been developed involving a virtual surface concept. The result will include a finished version of the concept with a functional library that has been derived for implementation. The collision detection library will be used to implement a new manual control interface for the robot. The new 'computer assisted control' will allow the user to drive the robot with limited set of manual control while ensuring that the two main functions of collision avoidance and surface acquisition are automatically handled.  Task 6: After the research and outcomes of the AIMS project were reviewed, the training requirements and methods of certification have been defined for those working with the new automated technology in the restoration of steel structures. These areas include the construction industry and the ship repair industry. AIMS addresses the pressing need to improve steel coating repair processes. Using current technology, inspection is highly subjective and surface preparation methods have associated high costs, low productivity and considerable hazards for workers and the natural environment. Lack of confidence and the difficulty of carrying out large scale inspection means that 100% removal of surface coatings is, unfortunately, the widespread practice. Thus the principal industrial objective of AIMS is to establish the know-how for two closely linked systems, (i) a non-destructive testing method giving quantified condition assessment of coated steelwork and (ii) equipment delivering alternative surface preparation methods for coating repair of large scale steelwork. With post-project development and exploitation, these will be produced and marketed in the construction, shipping and petro-chemical repair and maintenance industries. To maximise exploitation potential, project dissemination will be managed to build-up industry awareness, interest and market demand for product realisations of the new technologies. AIMS is extremely timely because it takes advantage of the growing acceptance of surface tolerant coatings. The new NDT know-how will give the confidence needed for selective preparation and recoating of structures, with potential project cost savings of up to 75%. Technology to be worked out for alternative surface preparation methods, with integrated management of pollution debris, will substantially support this. The anticipated break-through in industrial methods will be achieved by concentrating on currently unsolved, high risk technologies which include: - Investigation into quantification of surface preparation standards and recommendations for the use of alternative surface restoration methods. One major criterion will be the suitability for high surface area preparation rates, i.e. greater than 10m2/h. This evaluation work will provide important industry guidelines on the use of the alternative surface preparation methods. - Automated non-destructive testing methods suitable for quantified condition assessment of large scale coated steelwork, based on thermography and image processing. - Reconfigurable and flexible surface preparation tools with local pollution containment and suited to general work surface geometry for a variety of steel surface restoration methods. The developed tools are to be suited for integration into an automated man-machine system, thus eliminating the requirement of fully manual tool handling. This will safe-guard worker health and substantially reduce the environmental protection costs. - Concepts for automated man-machine systems to enable automated steel surface restoration. Such concepts will integrate the NDT classification methods and flexible tools developed in AIMS and provide a useful basis for post-project development and market promotion of the know-how. Through its make-up, the consortium is uniquely placed to develop and exploit the project outcomes beyond project completion. It includes firms working in the inspection and steel structure restoration industries, a producer of coatings and coating standards, mechatronic equipment/plant designer-producers, and a pan-European facility owners and operators consultative group.

520,204443,No,CHECKPOINTS IN CHECK: Novel Chemical Toolbox for Local Cancer Immunotherapy,"Cancer evades the immune system by generating an immunosuppressive tumour-microenvironment through various mechanisms to enable unhampered growth. Recent breakthroughs in blocking one of these mechanisms – the so called ‘immune checkpoints’ – put cancer immunotherapy back in the spotlights. Although promising, clinical benefits of these checkpoint inhibitors as single treatment has been limited to a subset of patients and goes along with unwanted systemic autoimmune toxicity. I hypostasize, that attacking the tumour microenvironment from multiple immunological angles simultaneously by local, conditional, and multimodal immunomodulation will greatly improve success of cancer immunotherapy and patient wellbeing. To achieve this, I will develop a highly defined synergistic chemistry-based molecular therapeutic toolbox to specifically attack cancer, acting on effector T cells, macrophages as well as tumour cells simultaneously. In this highly multidisciplinary endeavour I will (i) generate novel multifunctional dendritic cell targeted anti-cancer vaccines to ‘educate’ the patient’s immune system to recognise the tumour, (ii) I will develop conditional, targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors to release the immunosuppressive break specifically within the tumour microenvironment without the risk of autoimmunity and (iii) I will generate chemical tools to locally eliminate the tumour-associated macrophages to tear down a major immunosuppressive barrier. I will do so utilizing the novel ModimAb technology which I developed to obtain functionalized antibody fragments. These individual therapeutic tools will allow me and my research team to explore uncharted tumour immunological territories in vitro as well as in vivo, greatly advancing the field of cancer immunotherapy. But above all, together they will form a highly dedicated symbiotic immunotherapeutic regime which will be extremely effective without systemic side effects, dramatically improving patient care.",0,0
1072,32347,No,Company of the Future An international Research Project on the Management of Technology,"The objective of COF is to develop management tools and concepts to help European high-tech companies to better manage their technology development processes.  Three major motivations have led to the initiation of COF: The 'state of the art' of business administration falls short of meeting the specific requirements of technology-intensive companies in the modern complex business environment. From the start there is a close cooperation between University researchers and practitioners from collaborating companies to ensure the applicability of the instruments to be developed and to receive a constant flow of feedback from managers. The importance of creating a link to the influential Japanese business community in both practical management and University research has led to including a Japanese partner project.  The result of COF is the publication of a book containing the recommendation to implement the newly developed tools to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of technology management.  COF consists of three subprojects (Accountability of Technology, Industrial Research, Systems Companies) that aim at providing answers associated with the management of technology development. Moreover, there is a close collaboration with the Japanese partner project which concentrates on the aspects of human knowledge generation and the development of tools to support these processes.  In the early stages of the product development process, basic research is undertaken to generate a knowledge platform on which later activities can be built on. At that stage, it is crucial to generate and exchange information with third institutions conducting research in the same area (universities, research institutes, other companies). The goal of the subproject 'Industrial Research' is to identify the commercial functions of industrial research and to devise ways to better value knowledge generation in an environment of distributed knowledge.  There is a growing trend towards system products and interlinked development work of different companies. In these processes, specific problems arise between the different component makers and the company that is responsible for the system as a whole.  Consequently the 'Systems Companies' subproject ties to cope with the management of product development where R&D is divided among various organizations. The accounting, evaluation and control of the whole technology development process are the core issues of the 'Accountability of Technology' subproject on the European side. On the basis of the assumption that the current methods of financial control and accounting are not appropriate for technology development processes, new systems should be developed to allow for efficient management and resource allocation for such activities.  Achievements so far.  In the first part of the project, numerous interviews have been conducted in Europe as well as in Japan to identify functions of industrial research and problems of technology management in systems companies. Four case studies have been started to derive information structures for possible accountability systems. Some of the results already led to publications in journals such as Technovation. Additionally, the COF working paper series has been published.",0,0
757,107105,No,Probing the sequence determinants of ion channel voltage sensing via computation: towards the design of custom-tailored voltage-sensing modules,"Voltage sensing is a crucial property for a variety of proteins involved in many physiological functions (selective ion transport through membranes, enzymatic catalysis…). All these proteins achieve voltage sensing through the action of a 4 alpha-helix bundle module called the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). This transmembrane module achieves its function thanks to specific features, such as the presence of a large number of conserved charged or hydrophobic residues isolating the intracellular domain from the extracellular one. Despite these common features, nature achieves a surprising variability in terms of voltage-sensing properties, i.e., the thermodynamic and kinetic properties characterizing VSD activation span a wide range of values among the VSD superfamily. What are the residues responsible for such modulation and how this variability is achieved is not yet understood and is of great interest from a medical perspective, as it would shed light onto the effect of disease-involved mutation of crucial residues (channelopathies). This proposal offers to use the arsenal of computational methods derived from theoretical chemistry (molecular dynamics simulations using atomistic and polarizable force fields, free energy calculations, QM/MM calculations, force matching algorithms…) and bioinformatics (homology modeling, evolutionary modeling…) to unravel this question. The proposal unfolds in three steps: the first involves developing a robust framework to evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of activation of a specific VSD. The second consists in evaluating the impact of the mutation of specific residues on the parameters determined in step 1, while validating and refining the theoretical framework through comparison of these results to experimental ones from our collaborators. The final step consists in integrating this data in an evolutionary model including a variety of VSDs.",0,0
152,94137,Yes,Growing Inequalities' Impacts,"The project focus are inequalities in income/wealth and education and their social/political/cultural impacts. It combines an interdisciplinary approach, improved methodologies, wide country coverage, a clear policy dimension and broad dissemination. It exploits differences between and within countries in inequality levels and trends to understand impacts and tease out implications for policy and institutions. It highlights potential effects of individual distributional positions and increasing inequality for a host of ‘bad outcomes’ (societal and individual) and allows feedback from impacts to inequality in a frame of policy-oriented debate and comparison across 25 EU countries, USA, Japan, Canada and Australia. Social impacts include educational access and achievement, individual employment opportunities and labour market behaviour, household joblessness, living standards and deprivation, family and household formation/breakdown, housing and intergenerational social mobility, individual health and life expectancy, and social cohesion versus polarisation. Underlying long-term trends, the economic cycle and the current financial and economic crisis will be incorporated. Politico-cultural impacts investigated are: Do increasing income/educational inequalities widen cultural and political ‘distances’, alienating people from politics, globalisation and European integration? Do they affect individuals’ participation and general social trust? Is acceptance of inequality and policies of redistribution affected by inequality itself? What effects have political systems (coalitions/winner-takes-all)? Finally, it focuses on costs and benefits of limiting income inequality and its efficiency for mitigating other inequalities (health, housing, education and opportunity). A detailed flexible plan and support from an outstanding Advisory Board will allow the highly experienced research team to deliver important new answers to questions of great import to European societies.",1,1
109,47572,Yes,THE IMPACT of CLEAN PRODUCTION on EMPLOYMENT in EUROPE - AN ANALYSIS USING SURVEYS AND CASE STUDIES,"In the White Paper Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, the European Commission (1993) identified the need 'to analyse in which ways economic growth can be promoted in a sustainable way, which contributes to higher intensity of employment and lower intensity of energy and natural resources consumption'.  From a technological perspective, it is widely agreed that sustainable development requires a shift from end-of-pipe technologies to clean production.    The relationship between enhancing cleaner production and creating jobs is still controversial and not well understood. Strategies to identify and promote treble dividends (ecology, growth and jobs) have to be very specific and selective. It is crucial to know which synergies and/or conflicts exist for single countries, sectors and products, and how to handle them strategically.  Such specific information can only be generated by micro-studies such as surveys and case studies.    Following the Commission's White Paper on 'Growth, Competitiveness and Employment', the activities of the TSER programme 'aim at producing new knowledge and elucidating decision-making required in future at a decentralised, national or Community level and to lay the foundations for sustainable economic and social development of Europe's economies, enabling them to withstand international competition and create jobs'. The IMPRESS project directly addresses these goals for TSER projects. In particular, the objectives of IMPRESS are as follows:  - To establish a Europe-wide methodological framework for analysing the impact of clean production on employment,  - to use, wherever possible, data from European innovation data banks to examine the relationships between eco-innovation, employment, and competitiveness,  - to supplement existing information with in-depth case studies in selected industrial and service sectors,  - to obtain detailed, yet representative, information about eco-innovations through customised surveys on eco-innovation,  - to achieve a better understanding of synergies and conflicts between clean production, employment and competitiveness, and  - to provide policy makers with sector and country-specific micro-data which can be used to help strengthen synergies and to mitigate conflicts.",1,1
570,36132,No,The implications for fisheries management systems of interactions between farmed and wild caught species,"The project focuses on the demand for fish, and its implications for fishery management. Factors being determinants in the price formation process and the market structure (e.g., own-price and expenditure elasticities) are analysed. Focus will be on multi-species demand interdependencies between farmed and wild caught species. In addition to the key markets of France, Spain and the UK, the aggregated EU market will be analysed. Several North-Sea species are analysed. The supply side of both the farming industry and the marine wild fisheries will be explicitly modelled, and also accounted for in the demand analyses. Furthermore, price simulations and marine policy modelling analysis will be undertaken. STATE OF PROGRESS  As can be seen from Table 1 in 1997 we have started the work with part 1, 2 and 3. Most of the data collection is finished, and the market structure of the key-markets is mapped. The results will be available by the end of February 1998 in the form of three key-market reports (Part 1). Furthermore, the supply side analyses have resulted in two scientific reports, one where we estimate an aggregated Norwegian supply curve (Steen, Asche and Salvanes, 1997), and one productivity study of the Norwegian salmon industry by Tveteras and Heshmati (1997). The dataset for the Scottish salmon farming industry has been collected, and will be analysed in 1998. Work has begun on the development of a bioeconomic model of the North Sea fishery that will be used to determine the management implications of the interactions between the farmed and wild caught species. We started also the work on part 3 in 1997. On the second DEMINT workshop in June, market delineation was one of the main topics that was discussed. So far the work been concentrated on methodology, which recently has resulted in a scientific paper on cointegration and product aggregation methodology written by Asche, Bremnes and Wessells (1997).  The paper 'Market delineation and demand structure' was submitted and published in American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1997, 79: 139-50. Cointegration tests for market delineation and estimation of a dynamic system of demand equations are undertaken for three high-quality products in the EU; Fresh and frozen salmon and crustaceans. The ideas and methodology in this paper form the basic framework for the DEMINT project, only that in the DEMINT project we undertake analyses of a much broader product group.

These are described in Table 1.   Table 1 Main parts of the DEMINT project  Demand- or supply side Part Description Tasks involved Status by 31.12.97 Demandside Part 1 Data collection and descriptive analyses Tasks 1.1-3, 5 Nearly completed Supplyside Part 2 Supply side analyses Tasks 2.1-3 Started Demandside Part 3 Market Delineation analyses Tasks 3.1-3, 5 Started Demandside Part 4 Dynamic Demand modelling Tasks 4.1-3, 5 Not started Demand- and Supply combined Part 5 Price and quantity simulations/predictions Task 6 Not started '.........' Part 6 Marine policy implications analysis Task 7 Not started  In the first part we analyse the three key-markets, their industrial structure, their market characteristics etc. A review of the relevant literature that is available on these markets is undertaken. Necessary time series data (e.g., quantity and price) for the individual key species from each market are collected from local domestic statistics as well as from secondary sources (e.g., FAO, OECD and EUROSTAT statistics). The information collected at this stage is being used to produce three key-market reports one for each country, and the first part of the aggregated EU-market report. The species to be analysed are shown in Table 2:  In part 2, we concentrate on the supply side. We estimate aggregated supply models for the Norwegian and the Scottish farmed salmon industries (Sub-tasks 2.1 and 2.2). Furthermore we undertake productivity studies where we try to uncover which factors that have been important in determining the apparently large technological progress within these industries. Finally, we develop a bioeconomic model of the North Sea fishery that will be used to determine the management implications of the interactions between the farmed and wild caught species later in the project.  In Part 3 the objective is to analyse the demand interdependencies between wild caught and cultured species. The result from these analyses will be used to determine which species to consider in the dynamic demand systems (Task 4). More specifically, these analyses will use multivariate co integration techniques to test for price interdependencies between price series for wild caught and cultured species. This also involves the modelling of particular market characteristics such as seasonal variation in prices, structural shifts, etc.  Table 2 Species analysed  Spain France The UK The EU Salmon Salmon Salmon Salmon Cod Cod Cod Cod Halibut (Halibut) Halibut Halibut Whiting Whiting Whiting Whiting Monkfish Monkfish Monkfish Monkfish Hake Hake Hake Tuna Tuna Blue Mussels Blue Mussels Squid Squid Cuttlefish Cuttlefish Octopus Octopus  Spain France The UK The EU  Prawns Prawns  Trout Trout Trout  Saithe (Coal fish, Pollack) Saithe Saithe  Crustaceans (Prawns/Shrimps and Nephrops) Crustaceans (Prawns/Shrimps and Nephrops)  Plaice Plaice Plaice  Sole Sole  Lobster (prices) Lobster Lobster  Haddock Haddock Sardines Sardines Sea bass Sea bass  The objective in Part 4, is to estimate dynamic demand models to analyse the demand interdependencies between wild caught and cultured species. These analyses will use dynamic versions of almost ideal demand systems (AIDS) and single equation dynamic demand models, which estimate own-price, cross-price, and expenditure elasticities. The supply side will be incorporated either in the form of instrumental techniques or explicitly modelled using supply equations from Part 2.  In Part 5 we will use the estimated supply equations for the main cultured and wild caught species in the EU together with the dynamic demand models to simulate potential short and long run developments of production, prices and off-take in the fish markets. Specific scenarios will be explored relating to the impact on interdependent wild and aquaculture species markets of sustained growth in aquaculture production, changes in TACs with respect to selected marine fish species, and variation in imported supplies of wild salmon and other fish.  Finally, we will develop and assess alternative management strategies for both aquaculture and the traditional harvest sector taking into consideration the interactions at the demand level (Part 6).",0,0
770,215177,No,Role of Aβ Specific Regulatory T cells in harnessing cerebral Aβ clearance in Alzheimer’s Disease,"With populations ageing, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), for which there is still no cure, has become a major public health problem in Europe. This is partly due to the neglect of the role of the immune responses to the build-up of cerebral Aβ-the pathogenic agent triggering AD. Clinical trials for vaccines aimed at reducing cerebral Aβ were accompanied by severe side effects due to improper neuroinflammation.  While the input of microglia, the brain resident innate immune sentinels, is becoming clearer, the impact of the adaptive immune system, specifically T cells is still unknown. A promising therapeutic strategy, would be to strengthen Aβ-induced regulatory T cells (Treg), to alter the effector T cell mediated inflammatory response, while promoting clearance of Aβ by microglia. My interdisciplinary project hosted by Trinity College Dublin and supervised by Prof Lynch will draw together both Neuroscience and Immunology. I propose to assess the effect of Aβ-specific Treg on the pathoethiology of AD. To this aim, I will amplify a population of Aβ-specific Treg in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and will 1) assess if Aβ-specific Treg can regulate instruction of microglia to clear cerebral Aβ, while keeping inflammation under control, 2) determine if this regulatory effect occurs via paracrine mechanisms from the periphery or if Treg physically enter the CNS and 3) identify other Aβ-specific T cell populations involved in response to cerebral Aβ build-up and in alteration of microglial phagocytic activity. Completion of this project will make a critical contribution to the understanding of the immune response in AD and will pave the way towards safer therapeutic tools.  The proposed action will allow the dissemination of my work to both neuroscientists, immunologists, and the general public. I will reinforce my multidisciplinary and inter-sectoral skills, improve my management and teaching experience to establish myself among the leaders of research at ERC level.",0,0
464,221142,No,Changing the world of urban mobility thanks to Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence,"The booming urbanisation poses several challenges for cities such as growing traffic volumes, safety, and increasing environmental pressures. Enhancing the use of soft transportation modes (cycling and walking) will make cities more sustainable by reducing congestion and pollution. However city authorities are currently struggling to guarantee the safety of those vulnerable road users: they account for almost 70% of the road victims in urban areas. The objective of increasing the use of soft transport modes can only be achieved with a re-design of current urban mobility models. A holistic approach for managing urban traffic is one the most urgent needs of traffic authorities. Correspondingly, the associated traffic management market is projected to grow at a CAGR = 21% and reach the €19.4 billion by 2022. At ViNotion, a Dutch leading expert in intelligent image interpretation since 2007, we have developed UrbanDynamics, a real-time traffic monitoring and managing system that uses raw traffic data from cameras to recognise, track, and analyse the behaviour of all urban traffic participants, including bicycles and pedestrians. Our solution collects data from pre-existing cameras and by means of machine- and deep learning, analyses the behaviour of all traffic participants providing an in-depth insight into complex urban traffic scenarios. Our competitive advantages rely on the high accuracy, even in broad areas with only one system (false detections < 1% in 18m width lane), and versatility of the traffic information obtained (counting, speed, direction, queue length, waiting time, etc.). At ViNotion we aim at making EU cities more friendly for pedestrians and bicycles and reduce associated traffic fatalities by facilitating an optimal integration of the soft transportation modes into the urban environment. UrbanDynamics will boost our growth with revenues surpassing the €18 million in the 3rd year after market uptake and the creation of up to 15 new position.",0,0
864,78463,No,"Molecular, Environmental and Nutritional Evaluation of Bambara Groundnut (Vigna subterranea L.Verdc.) for Food Production in Semi-Arid Africa and India","Bambara groundnut can contribute to food security of some of the worlds poorest people. Traditional landraces have good nutritional properties, drought tolerance and can yield protein-rich pods where other crops may fail. Recent EU-funded research has deve loped the first hybrids of bambara groundnut landraces. This proposal links partners in Africa, Europe and India in a project that combines molecular, environmental and nutritional studies and end-users of bambara groundnut. By dissecting the underlying ge netics of the crop and testing its performance across a range of environments, the project will establish criteria and resources required for systematic, regional breeding and improvement programmes that minimise duplication of effort. Within 4 years colla borators will produce the first varieties of the crop, assess products for a range of uses and identify cultivars and management practices to optimise performance in specific environments. Two genetic linkage maps of bambara groundnut will be made - a `wid e' cross (cultivated x wild relative) and a `narrow' cross (cultivated x cultivated), using AFLP, SSR and DArT markers. Collaborators will identify genes and QTL's for drought, heat and cold tolerance and photoperiodic control of pod filling and will link genetic and biochemical composition of seeds from genotypes to quantify nutritional composition, nutritive value and processing potential. The development of microarray-based accessions for landraces, microsatellite markers and genetic maps for bambara gro undnut, will be coupled with agronomic and physiological assessment, through multi-environment QTL analysis and the testing of common landraces across locations. Key traits will be dissected and markers developed. The genetics underlying nutritional and pr ocessing value will be assessed and new products developed through SMEs. At all stages end-users will guide researchers towards desirable traits from new genetic material and novel products.",0,0

153,88800,Yes,Inclusive Identities in the Context of Increasing Culturally Diverse Workplaces,"With increasing globalization and migration the workplace is becoming more and more culturally diverse worldwide. As finding meaningful employment is an important factor for successful integration into the new country of settlement, interactions between different ethnic groups at the workplace need to be specifically looked at. The overall focus of this research proposal is on influences of national and organizational factors on successful management of cultural diversity at the work floor. The goal is to understand the formation and role of inclusive identities in a work context that ensure a sense of sharedness while being grounded in awareness and appreciation of mutual differences. This will not only reduce social tensions but also produce positive outcomes in our society. The theoretical rationale behind is grounded in theories on social identity, self-categorization and acculturation including multidisciplinary perspectives. It is assumed that different policies and histories of migration, country-specific demographics and economics and unique cultural belief and value systems influence the direction and strengths of the diversity effects within a society. With co-operation partners in Austria, the Netherlands and New Zealand the opportunity for cross-national comparative studies is given to get a more holistic picture of general and specific preconditions, processes and effects of inclusive identities in the context of increasing culturally diverse workforces and multiculturalism in Europe. The scientific knowledge gained shall lead to recommendations for successful diversity management and the development of diagnostic instruments that consider the cultural and organizational context and the specific ethnic groups involved in the interactions. Presentations and publications within and outside the academic community shall secure the knowledge transfer to potential end-users and relevant decision makers and thus contribute to European competitiveness.",1,1

1032,185537,No,Integrated Macro-Financial Modelling for Robust Policy Design,"During the global financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession, economists at policy-making institutions had little choice but to augment macroeconomic models with ad-hoc assumptions and adjustments in order to provide analysis and advice for policy makers. Our consortium’s proposal aims to move policy-focused macroeconomic modelling beyond this approach to the endogenous modelling of the dynamics resulting from financial risks and related decision making in banks, households, firms and public institutions. We bring together four broad lines of research to systematically develop new behavioural and institutional building blocks, integrating them in policy-focused macroeconomic models and using these models in a new framework for policy evaluation. In terms of building blocks, one line of research moves beyond the assumption of representative and homo-oeconomicus-type agents to incorporate micro-behavioural realism in decision making, while a second line of research advances the modelling of financial institutions, their fragility and the dynamics of systemic risk. The third line of research integrates these new building blocks (including a selection of those developed by researchers outside the consortium) in a new generation of policy-focused macroeconomic models. In parallel, in the fourth line of research new policy evaluation tools are developed, with a focus on robust tools aimed at containing financial contagion and boom-bust cycles, maintaining fiscal sustainability and coordinating monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies in normal and crisis regimes. The consortium comprises researchers with a strong track record in advancing the frontier on behavioural and institutional modelling, highly influential macroeconomic modellers as well as seasoned veterans of model-based monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policy evaluation and design. Consortium members have strong academic backgrounds as well as substantive practical experience at policy-making institutions.",1,0
375,213701,Yes,SME LOYALISER: fostering SME retailers through LOYALty Integrated SERvices,"In a world where your competitors are only a click away, customer loyalty really is the new marketing. Indeed, large organisations like big retailers invest millions of euros into loyalty programs. However, small to medium enterprises (SMEs) like the bakery in front of your house or the lifelong toy shop that you already visited as a child, cannot invest that sort of money. So how can these SMEs remain competitive facing the all-powerful big companies? Both from the Business-to-Business (B2B) or the Business-to-Customer (B2C) perspective, a mobile loyalty solution like SME LOYALISER builds not only a new sense of affinity between consumers, brands and merchants, but works in line with consumers’ interests. However, the current solutions in the market offer only isolated applications that are not able of smartly interconnect to acquire broader knowledge about the customers and to allow enhanced services. We, bluesource - mobile solutions GmbH, are developing SME LOYALISER, a retailing-customised platform that brings together all players in the retailing chain and applies the latest advances in customers’ data exploitation (predictive and behavioural analysis) in a holistic hub where any kind of company, especially SMEs in the retailing sector, can leverage the benefits of advanced loyalty programs.  SME LOYALISER will facilitate implanting loyalty programs and additional services in SME retailing businesses that enables to identify profitable customer behaviour, increase the customer base and drive wallet and loyalty program profitability. This way, we permit SME retailers provide the features of big Internet retailers, fostering the competition and strengthening the SME industrial tissue. With this project, we estimate €14.4 million revenue by 2022 and the generation of 20 new direct job positions, besides another 20-30 indirect ones throughout sales partners and advertising activities.",1,1
390,103482,No,The invention of a diaspora: the case of Arbëresh,"This project will study the formation of the Arbëresh minority, currently one of the twelve officially recognized linguistic minorities in Italy. This proposal aims to address the problem of identity construction as started by diverse immigrant groups that, notwithstanding their common origin roughly corresponding to present-day Albania, were at first very different from one another in terms of religion, culture and language. In particular, this research will allow to critically reconsider the concept of diaspora. Scholars have so far analyzed diaspora phenomena as coherent units of geographically dispersed people bound by sentiment, culture and history. On the contrary, this project aims to demonstrate that the cultural identity of a diaspora is not necessarily formed by the dispersion of ethnically homogeneous groups, but it is rather the result of a long-term process that can take place in the host countries. The project is divided into three parts. The first part studies the Albanian emigration to Southern Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth century and the foundation of rural communities on Italian territory by immigrants. The second part examines the period of the Counter-Reformation. The Albanian colonies became part of the Catholic Church, but at the same time they adopted a particular religious rite, the so-called Greek rite, which has distinguished them from the Catholic majority. The result was the birth of a Uniate Catholic Church in 1595, which brought together the various Albanian colonies in Italy. The third part studies the achievement of ethnic identity in the seventeenth century, on the basis of the religious identity. The project will be carried out at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, which is currently engaged in several international and European research projects focused on the history of diasporas. The main expected result is the preparation of a book that will be the fourth monograph of the researcher",0,0
213,39079,Yes,INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS and LOCALIZED TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE: the dyn amics of clustered SMES networking,"Many S&T policies at European, national and local level have been shaped by a top-down approach which has been recently challenged by the localized technological knowledge model, which stresses on the role of context-dependent knowledge and communication flows among agents, expecially within highly innovative clustered SMEs This theoretical and policy confrontation of alternative frameworks has been recently given a new content by the increased role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Science & Technology Policy, both in topdown processes of creation of knowledge and in networking and percolation processes of localized technological knowledge in clustered SMEs.   The existence of precise theoretical as well as policy gaps to be filled leads to the main objectives of this project, that include:   a) to better understand the dynamics of knowledge creation and competence in firms and industrial and technological districts;  b) to provide analytical tools for cooperation among co-localized firms within industrial and technological districs;  c) to assess the dynamics of industrial districts in terms of productivity, growth and employment;  d) to produce scientific advancements in the study of the effects of Telecommunications-based Networks (TBNs) on the innovative processes within the innovation network and on their role in the   establishement of 'pro-growth coalitions' among institutional, academic and commercial actors;  e) to assess the achievements of the various initiatives of the European Union in order to develop the localized innovative processes at district level;  g) to provide effective tools, in order to develop a more integrated European approach to local development policymaking.   The ultimate goal of this project is to show the degrees of complementariety between top-down and localized technological knowledge approaches to policymaking, indicating the forms of networking of innovative clustered SMEs, with special reference to the role and limits of ICT in the process of creation of knowledge.   The objectives of the project will be achieved through three different phases with brainstorming sessions expressely designed in order to develop the methodology for the following stages and to self-assess the coherence of the partial results to the objectives of the project:   1. Scientific Analysis: this first phase covers the first year of the research and provides economic as well as quantitative analyses, which integrate, (and provides the methodology), for qualitative fieldwork casestudies. The partnership will be enabled to create the necessary framework for policy and the first results will be diffused by means of technical seminars.   2. Policy Analysis: the achievements of the first phase, in terms of economic, industrial demography and statistical analysis, as well as comparative fieldwork case-studies, will be used by the partners involved in the analysis of tools and issues for policymaking. A feedback from the end-users of the policies is provided, in order to self-assess the results of the First Phase.   3. Policy Reccomendations: the third phase will be centred on the implications for local as well as EU S&T policy (and ICT policy as well) and to a further consolidation of the diffusion of interim and final results.   Special roles and functions are given to the Advisory Group, which consists of end-users (Innovation Relay Centres, Science & Technology Parks, Associations of and single SMEs, regional and EU policymakers). This precise need arises from the contiguity of the policy objectives of the project to the establishment of local and trans-European 'pro-growth' coalitions for highly innovative clustered SMEs.",0,1
943,60790,No,Towards Handicap Integration Negotiating Knowledge - Baltic extension,"THINK - Towards Handicap Integration Negotiating Knowledge - is a project that takes into account the many difficulties faced by the physically handicapped in accomplishing full professional integration. Using the methods made available by the new Information and Communication Technologies, mainly through telework, it aims to develop their capabilities, market their services and achieve full professional integration. Key terms are to become productive, profitable and self-sufficient. The main objective is to benefit the social and economic insertion of 300 disabled persons in 29 months in areas such as accounting, translations, word processing, web design, programming and technical assistance for computer systems. The reasoning behind THINK implementation is the broader geographical application of PORCIDE, providing a new perspective of life to the Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Scottish, Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian disabled participants, following a recommendation of the European Council, which envisages a guiding program of the rehabilitation and integration in favour of the disabled persons. [Recommendation R (92) adopted by the Ministers Committee of the European Council in 9 April 1992]. Through partnerships with companies based in those countries and multinationals, TELEMANutenção envisages to export this innovative concept of work environment, conjugating technology and socio-economic concerns, resulting in a transnational revolutionary project. The large corporate companies have a fundamental role in the process, since they will be a significant part of the future clients. THINK features an integrated and flexible approach to the countries participating, enhancing the opportunities for co-operation, showing that telework has no geographical boundaries and that any company or individual, no matter the physical location, has potential to compete and to co-operate nationally as well as internationally.",0,0

Politics, profession and economics in the left-wing commitment, 1930s-1960s.","Abstract: ENGECON will study by a transnational-comparative prosopographical approach the engagement of economists in the communist, socialist and labour lefts over three Western European major countries (France, United Kingdom and Italy), from the 1930s to the 1960s. By engagement, ENGECON means a partisan activism linked to the participation in public debate that contributes to the legitimization, dissemination as well as the elaboration of economic ideas. It studies three principal specific objectives: the factors explaining engagement; the practices of engagement; the implications of engagement for the economic thought, as well as the professional trajectory and the intellectual status of the engaged economists. It assumes that the analysis of engagement is essential to understand the role of economists in society. An unprecedented role of economists in a labour movement on the ascent, the rise of the heterodox economics and the apogee of the managed economy characterise this period.

113,74576,Yes,Encouraging and stimulating future RTD cooperation in the field of information society technologies between Europe and Asia-Pacific region,"IST research becomes increasingly international following the general trends of ICT development. A call to make the European IST research more open to the world is strong in the running FP6 and will be even stronger in the forthcoming FP7. At the same time, the level of international cooperation in IST research between Europe and Asia-Pacific region is far away from the level of political and economic ties between the regions.  As a matter of fact, there are no European IST projects with participation of partners from South-East Asia launched so far. This situation is not only affecting progress in research, but also hampering business opportunities of European ICT industry on the world's most promising ICT market. The project sees its mission and overall objective in stimulating and enhancing international cooperation in the field of IST between EU and Asia-Pacific region by linking research communities and creating new partnerships, mapping and promoting opportunities for joint research and ICT business partnerships, facilitating inclusion of research teams from Asia into European FP7 IST consortia. It will be achieved by: - Mapping regional IST landscape and matching regional IST research capabilities with current and future EU's IST Strategic  Objectives; - Running a series of scientific workshops in the region addressing several application contexts of 'ambient intelligence' concept; - Developing on-line dynamic inventory of IST groups in the region (partner search engine); - Improving public awareness of European ICT industry (European Industrial Events) and cooperative opportunities of FP7 (FP7 Information Days) and promoting bi-regional cooperation via various channels.  The project consortium composed of leading European IST research and industrial players and partners from all major regional IST-strong countries believes that the project is able to improve radically the climate for bi-regional IST cooperation right at the joint between FP6 and FP7.",0,1
74,226666,Yes,"How Work Organizations Shape Ethnic Stratification across Immigrant Generations: Assimilation, Segregation, and Workplace Contexts","Large-scale immigration has introduced salient new dimensions of ethnic stratification in Europe’s rich, liberal democracies—successful incorporation of disadvantaged, newcomer immigrant minorities now poses a critical challenge for the 21st century. Despite a vast literature on labor market inequalities between immigrants and natives, the great majority of these studies is based on surveys of individual workers and yield limited knowledge about the role of firms and workplace contexts. Still, there has been no systematical attempt to exploit linked employer-employee (LEE) data to assess how work organizations are linked to economic assimilation across immigrant generations. Here I bring a new organizational focus on workplaces as key sites where contemporary dynamics of ethnic stratification unfold at the micro level. The objective of OrgMIGRANT is to demonstrate how work organizations both contribute to and reflect changing patterns of ethnic stratification across immigrant generations. We will study workplace segregation and probe whether, how, and why ethnic boundary salience and immigrant-native inequalities vary by organizational context, net of worker traits. To this end, we will use economy-wide LEE data from Norway and comparisons with selected high-income countries (i.e., Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France, Canada, and the United States). Our world-class data allow us to situate workers inside workplaces, enabling the study of the organizational context of immigrant-native labor market inequalities in high detail using state-of-the-art panel data techniques. OrgMIGRANT will be organized into three work packages: (1) organizational sources behind native-immigrant workplace segregation; (2) organizational determinants of immigrant-native inequalities within workplaces; (3) a cross-national comparison of organizational variation in workplace-specific immigrant-native pay inequalities and the size of within-job pay gaps (i.e., same occupation and workplace).",1,1
1098,63615,No,GIS technology and market in south East Europe - study,"This proposal addresses spatial data infrastructures in South East Europe, e.g. in the countries Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia. The overall aim is to provide a comprehensive documentation of the spatial data infrastructures in these countries, describing data, actors and applications. Data collection will be based on questionnaires, and conducted with the help of local subcontractors. An analysis will present obstacles and favourable conditions for the use and deployment of GIS technology, the lack and the need for standardization and for harmonization of business processes. Differences and the common issues between the countries will be determined, prospects for further developments provided and necessary future activities, a roadmap and policy recommendations for the region in this sector defined. Geographic information is part of the Information Society, and beneficiaries of this study will be everybody having an interest in the region, especially private actors, governments, donors. Dissemination will be an important part in order to create awareness of the results of this study.  Objectives: The proposal aims to provide a complete picture of the spatial data infrastructure in South East Europe, comprising the countries Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia. A spatial data infrastructure is defined as encompassing the policies, organisational remits, data, technologies, standards, delivery mechanisms, and financial and human resources necessary to ensure that those working at the global and regional scale are not impeded in meeting their objectives. Thus the proposed study will collect and describe all these elements, followed by an analysis in order to find out obstacles and the favourable conditions for the use and deployment of GIS technology, the lack and the need for standardization and for harmonization of business processes. This analysis will lead to concrete proposals to fully establish this infrastructure and use it for the benefit of the region. The project aims to provide a roadmap and policy recommendations not only to actors in the sector of Geographic Information, but to all decision makers, to governments and donors, that they take these policy recommendations into account for the definition of future policy and projects of all kind. Results of the study will be pro-actively disseminated.  Work description: The proposed study project will start with the precise definition of the data to be collected, followed by a definition of questionnaires in order to carry out surveys in the countries considered. Having collected the questionnaires and analysed their results, missing information may be added by in-depth interviews, or if necessary on-site visits. The information collected will be analysed, using SWOT methodology, which is followed by the definition of policy recommendations and a roadmap. The final result will be made available on the World Wide Web and also in printed form.  Following on from this, the work plan is broken down in the following work packages: - Management and Co-ordination (work package 1); - Start up phase of the project (work package 2); - Interviews and data collection (work package 3); - Data analysis (work package 4); - Documentation (work package 5); - Dissemination (work package 6).  The partners understand the risks inherent in carrying out surveys, and include necessary contingency measures. In order to collect data in the countries considered and to obtain reliable information about the countries considered, the partners will take advantage of selected subcontractors. It will be very important to select reliable and experienced subcontractors; they have already been chosen in Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The proposers intend to select the remaining subcontractors after the start of the funded phase of the project, in order to be able to guarantee the right qualification and experience. The study is based on earlier work of the partners, which gives them the necessary experience to achieve high quality results. Whereas the local partners have the necessary experience in the area and the region, the European Union partners, GISIG and EuroGeographics will add a real European value.  Milestones: The final results of the study will consist of a complete picture of the spatial data infrastructures in all countries of South East Europe, their analysis and a roadmap and policy recommendations for futures action. The results will be made available in one conference paper, in a book and a World Wide Web site with the complete documentation. The results are expected to influence decision makers, politicians and donors, also outside of the specific sector, since geographic information is part of the Information Society.  Further, the work will lead (1) to a network of GIS actors in the region, who continue to work on those issues; (2) to the introduction of standards and modern technology. The project will in its sector contribute to the integration of the region, and with the European Union.",0,0
856,222191,No,The potential of Sharing Resources for mitigating carbon emissions and other environmental impacts,"Household sizes in countries of the European Union have been declining steadily, and this trend is set to continue in the future. This is likely to ‘slow down’ reductions of per capita carbon emissions because it reduces economies of scale within households. It is important to understand these ‘reduction offsets’ in order to design effective carbon reduction policies.  This project will examine the role of declining household sizes for trends in per capita carbon emissions and other environmental impacts, using longitudinal and cross-sectional household expenditure datasets for EU countries, and input-output data on emissions and other environmental impacts. Qualitative expert interviews will be carried out to formulate policy recommendations, taking underlying sociological and demographic trends into account. This project therefore seeks to make an original empirical and theoretical contribution to understanding the ways in which consumption-based emissions and environmental impacts are embedded within broader socio-cultural trends. Its policy recommendations will help to design more effective carbon reduction policies. This fellowship will facilitate a unique two-way transfer of knowledge between the host, Dr Buchs, at the University of Leeds Sustainability Research Institute, and the ER, Dr Ivanova, from the Norwegian University of Technology and Science. Dr Ivanova, a trained economist, will contribute her skills in input-output carbon footprinting modelling and econometric analysis. She will gain new knowledge and skills in the sociological and mixed methods analysis of underlying trends of household emissions and environmental impacts, as advised by Dr Buchs who is an environmental social scientist. The fellowship will equip Dr Ivanova with new knowledge, research and project management skills, enabling her to establish herself as an internationally recognised academic in this field and a connector between research, policy and civil society.",1,0
501,4359,No,Use of solid oxide fuel cells as a chemical reactor,"Fuel cells which oxidize hydrogen to produce electricity and water can also be used to oxidize other chemical compounds such as methane, ethylene, propylene to produce valuable chemical products. It is the objective of the project to explore the possibilities for a  SOFC to be used as a new highly selective and energy efficient chemical reactor for oxidation processes and CO hydrogeneration reactions. In this research it will be investigated how the selectivity and yield can be improved. In this research the NEMCA effect (discovered in research carried out under a previous EC contract) which can strongly improve the catalytic properties of metals in a SOFC, will play a central role.  I. New processes  The following systems were investigated under NEMCA effect conditions:  I1. Ethylene epoxidation on Ag films deposited on ytrria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ), an O2- conductor, and on beta'-Al2O3, a Na\ conductor.  I2. Hydrogenation of CO2 on Pd deposited on YSZ and on beta'-Al2O3.  I3. Hydrogenation of CO on Pd interfaced to YSZ.  I4. Methanol synthesis via hydrogenation of CO2 over a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst interfaced to YSZ.  I5. Ethylene oxidation on Pd interfaced with YSZ or beta'-Al2O3.  I6. Oxidative coupling of methane over a manganese oxide catalyst interfaced with YSZ.  I7. Propene partial oxidation to acrolein on Cu2O or Au/Cu2O electrodes and CO oxidation on copper oxide electrodes interfaced to YSZ.  I8. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia on Pt interfaced with YSZ. Significant nonfaradaic rate changes were observed (by up to 25000%) as well as changes in product selectivity. The most promising system is the ethylene epoxidation reaction over Ag/beta'-Al2O3 where a maximum ethylene oxide selectivity value of 88% was obtained for a sodium coverage equal to 0.03 and 1ppm dicloroethane in the gas phase. This is one of the highest values reported in the open or patent literature, thus the results may be of immediate technological importance.   II. General rules and origin of the NEMCA effect  II1. The following rules, for some of which experimental evidence already existed, were firmly established:  (a) The order of magnitude of the enhancement factor or Faradaic efficiency lambda defined from:  lambda=deltar/(I/2F)  where deltar is the change in the catalytic reaction rate (expressed in mol O), I is the applied current (defined positive when anions are supplied to the catalyst) and F is the Faraday constant, can be estimated for any catalytic reactor from:  |lambda| is approximately equal to 2Fro/I0  where ro is the open-circuit (unpromoted) catalytic rate and I0 is the exchange current of the catalyst-solid electrolyte interface.  (b) The magnitude of the rate change relaxation time constant tau can be predicted by:  tau is approximately equal to 2FN/I  where N (mol) is the reactive oxygen uptake of the catalyst which expresses, approximately, the catalyst surface area.  (c) Depending on the polarity of the bond broken or formed in the rate limiting step electrophobic or electrophilic behaviour is observed. A catalytic reaction is termed electrophobic when its rate increases with increasing catalyst potential or work function, while a catalytic reaction is termed electrophilic when its rate increases with decreasing catalyst potential or work function  (d) the catalytic rates are exponentially dependent on catalyst potential and work function:  ln(r/ro)= alpha(delta(e{phi})/kbt) = alpha((F delta VWR)/RT)  where ro is the open-circuit catalytic rate   II2. Regarding the physicochemical origin of NEMCA the following studies were performed:  (a). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the effect of electrochemical oxygen pumping on Pt catalyst films interfaced with YSZ. It was found that electrochemical oxygen pumping to the catalyst causes spillover of significant amounts of anionic oxygen from the solid electrolyte onto the platinum film surface. The spillover oxygen species has an XPS binding energy 528.8 eV compared to 530.4 eV for chemisorbed oxygen, which is also observed on the surface, and is less reactive than chemisorbed oxygen with the reducing ultrahigh vaccum background. The detection of the anionic oxygen species upon electrochemical pumping confirms the previously proposed explanation of the NEMCA effect.  (b). The effect of induced work function changes on the kinetics and energetics of the interaction of oxygen with polycrystalline Pt interfaced with YSZ, were studied, by means of the temperature programmed desorption technique (TPD). It was found that by increasing catalyst potential and work function the oxygen desorption peak shifts towards lower temperatures, showing that the binding strength of chemisorbed oxygen species weakness by increasing catalyst work function. The activation energy of desorption of adsorbed oxygen species was found to decrease linearly with slope -1 with increasing catalyst work function. This straightforward experimental correlation between catalyst work function and the binding energy of chemisorbed oxygen species is in absolute agreement with the observed linear dependence of the apparent activation energy on catalyst potential and work function, of all reactions studied.   As a result of the present studies it was firmly established that the NEMCA effect is due to the controlled migration (back-spillover) of promoting ions from the solid electrolyte to the gas-exposed catalyst-electrode surface under the influence of the applied current or potential. Some of the promoting ions, eg O{delta-} cannot be introduced from the gas phase. The ability of solid electrolytes to precisely tune the in situ introduction of dopants on catalyst surfaces creates several interesting technological possibilities and allows for a detailed study of the role of promoters in heterogeneous catalysis. The proposed programme will concentrate on the study of NEMCA in SOFC reactors for a selected number of technologically important partial oxidation and CO hydrogenation reactions. The main goals are :   1. To examine the effect of changing catalyst potential and work function (via NEMCA) together with temperature, space velocity and reactant composition on product selectivity and to compare the maximum obtainable selectivity via NEMCA with the maximum obtainable selectivity utilizing commercial promoted catalysts.   2. To establish general trends or rules governing the effect of NEMCA on product selectivity. Such trends or rules will be useful guidelines for extending future NEMCA studies to systems for which no satisfactory catalytic processes are currently available. Both metal and metal oxide catalyst-electrodes will be studies in the course of the investigation. Most of the work involving metals will be carried out at ICE-HT in Patras and most of the work involving oxide will be done at the University of Karlsruhe (UKARL), where extensive experience already exists on the deposition of metal oxide electrodes in SOFC reactors.   The following systems will be investigated :   Ethylene epoxidation on AG (ICE - HT) . SP 0 Partial oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde (UKARL)  Partial oxidation of propylene on Au (UK and Cu2O (UKARL)  Oxydative coupling of methane (ICE - HT)  Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (ICE - HT)  Methanol synthesis (ICE - HT)  Catalyst characterization and elucidation of the NEMCA mechanism (ICE-HT and UKARL)",0,0
46,73875,Yes,Financial Integration in Europe and the Propagation of Shocks,"Abstract This project aims at developing a solid understanding of the channels through which shocks are transmitted through and between financial markets in Europe. In particular, we will study the role of the banking market, the bond market, and the equity market for the transmission of shocks. In order to thoroughly assess the role played by Europe's financial markets for the propagation of shocks we will also study the links between financial market development and real economic activity. We will analyse the exposure of banks to changes in risk in integrated markets and the transmission of shocks through cross-border activities of banks. In order to improve our understanding of how the European bond markets work after the launching of the euro, we will evaluate potential differences in the transmission of the single monetary policy on the macroeconomic variables of the different EMU members.The project will clarify how equity market integration has affected the transmission of shocks across countries and how vulnerable European equity markets are to contagion effects. As evidenced by the recent turmoil in Asia, this is of utmost societal importance. We will also investigate the links between financial market developments and real economic activity in the EU. Our results will help to assess how autonomous financial market shocks propagate through financial markets and how an initial purely financial shock may eventually affect real economic activity. As the project covers the most important segments of European financial markets, our research will have a significant impact on a broad spectrum of policy issues including banking supervision, the promotion of bond market liquidity, the reforms of equity market institutions, and not least macroeconomic policy.",1,1
515,56878,No,Open Model For Network-wide Heterogeneous Intersection-based Transport Management,"Traffic managers in Europe face the problem of protecting their investments in telematics infrastructure. Using new applications or even introducing new features to existing systems very frequently forces traffic authorities to make - once more - new investments and replace legacy infrastructure, in many cases while it is still fully operational. OMNI will address this problem by facilitating the re-use of legacy infrastructure by new transport telematics applications. To that end, the project will develop a network-wide, intersection-driven transport management model. The model will act as an intermediate layer that isolates the actual network infrastructure from the applications that are using it. The project will model the existing components in the network considering both their physical characteristics and their functionality. The model will present standard interfaces to the objects of the network, allowing the integration of advanced telematics applications or new devices in a pre-existing network infrastructure. The model will be implemented in the form of two prototypes composed by a set of technical specifications and a software product for exploitation.  Fig. 1: OMNI Model. The project will also involve research activities in a number of transport telematics application areas (advanced traffic control systems, automatic incident detection and end user information via the WWW) as well as video-based sensors for surveillance and traffic management. This will allow, on the one hand, achieving additional performance in these application areas and, on the other hand, using these telematics applications and devices as test cases to evaluate the performance of the OMNI model. The final prototype will be evaluated in four pilot sites. The different traffic infrastructures and user requirements of these sites will validate the openness of the model, and the use of different traffic management architectures (centralised, distributed) will validate Traffic managers in Europe face the problem of protecting their investments in telematics infrastructure.

Testing the openness of the model with respect to diverse user requirements and traffic infrastructures in four test sites: Alicante, Milano, Chania and a virtual test site in Paris.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The work will begin with the review of the state-of-the-art. Relevant users will be identified and classified and a questionnaire will be distributed among them in order to extract relevant information about their main needs and requirements. Local authorities, traffic systems manufacturers, traffic operators and end users (drivers) will be contacted, when possible meetings with these users will be conducted in order to get a more complete appreciation of their needs. The main system requirements and socio-economic constraints will be extracted as conclusions from both user requirements and current system capabilities. The task will also define preliminary methods and indicators for the evaluation of the system. User requirements will then be translated into technical specifications of the system as a whole and of the individual modules. An accurate analysis of the evidenced user needs and system requirements will be the next step. The final result will be a system architecture design that uses the UML Methodology. The development of the project's first prototype will be done on the basis of the previous analysis and design work already mentioned. This comprises the implementation and integration of all project modules. An evaluation plan will define the evaluation methodology to be used in the project. The development of the first prototype will be tested in laboratory. Issues such as the integration of modules, the compliance of the operation of the system with the technical specifications, the reliability, communications, etc, will be assessed. On the basis of the first prototype, the project's final prototype will be implemented: specific developments will be made in each evaluation site, in order to adapt the system to the site characteristics and to enable its further installation and evaluation. At the end of the project, the main conclusion is that the OMNI MOUN is able to model the topology and traffic management infrastructures of any European city as demonstrated. No changes on the current architectures, infrastructures and devices have been necessary to use OMNI in four different sites. In addition to the configuration of the logical representation of the physical infrastructures, the only one requirement to use OMNI is to implement the necessary interfaces for making the different components OMNI compliant. These interfaces are small pieces of software to be implemented by the components providers. Guidelines to do this have been produced and successfully applied in each site. The approach used by the OMNI model allows to connect and inter-operate existing devices and applications by mean of developing software interfaces towards the model. At the same time the model provides for a system independent interface to expose data and functionalities to new applications (i.e. advanced control systems, information systems). The demonstration pilots have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Based on COM technologies, the technological approach followed for the implementation of the OMNI model facilitates the adoption of standard communication protocols; independence from operating systems; high level of scalability, and a distributed architecture.",0,0
880,98716,No,DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF INNOVATIVE SOCIAL INSURANCE POLICIES,"'The following proposal aims at the design and evaluation of innovative social insurance policies (DEISIP) as alternatives to current policies applied by governments in industrialized countries. The study of Social Insurance (SI) policies is motivated by the high and rapidly increasing total expenditure on SI policies in OECD countries. These expenditures have increased on average across OECD countries from 16% of GDP in 1980 to 21% in 2003 (OECD, 2007). Given these statistics, governments throughout the world are keen on either finding alternative policies to the existing ones or increasing the efficiency of current policies. In order to address these issues the study will use Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with heterogeneous agents. This type of models is becoming extremely influential in macroeconomic for studies of economies that involve dynamics, uncertainty and policy design. This proposal is composed of three sub-projects, each dealing with at least one SI policy. The unifying theme of all projects is the analysis of creative policies that have strong relevancy for economic outcomes through in-depth welfare examination. The first sub-project is Unemployment insurance over the business cycle. In this sub-project, I will study state-dependent policies towards unemployed workers, i.e., I will allow the characteristics of the UI policy, such as the duration and the level of payments, to change over the business cycle in an optimal way. The Second sub-project is Integration of social insurance policies. In this sub-project, I will examine the potential for a welfare gain by integrating several SI policies, i.e. allow households to use funds saved in a specific account for a variety of purposes such as out-of-pocket health expenditures, and housing. Since the events covered by SI policies - such as illness, unemployment, and retirement age - are not perfectly correlated, there is a potential welfare gains from integration of these policies'",1,0
126,41902,Yes,"Trade, inequality and European unemployment","The rise of inequalities is unquestionably one of the most decisive factors shaping the political agendas of most OECD countries. In the US, rising wage inequalities are at the heart of debates concerning the role of minimum wages on the one hand, and of tax policies on the other. In Europe, the problem is manifested in workers' inequality in their access to jobs - unemployment - and the debate concerns the degree of flexibility needed to circumvent this inequality. Yet after almost two decades analysing this crucial topic, we still lack a clear understanding of the main causes and policy implications of this (joint) phenomenon. This proposal aims to bring together the disparate strands of research on this topic, foster collaboration betweer groups of researchers who tended in the past to work in relative isolation and so to develop a consensus on the analytical frameworks which are appropriate to analyse the relationship between the process of globalization and the twin in-equalities of incomes and of access to jobs, two key factors affecting social exclusion.  The proposed thematic network will address two key aspects of the TSER Work Programme: the relationship between employment and technical change (area I.2.1), and developing new analytical approaches for identifying key mechanisms (such as unemployment and income inequalities) which produce social exclusion (area III.2).   The network will help develop a coherent framework for the analysis of the causes of unemployment, which takes into account factors such as international trade, market integration and globalization, and `skills-biased' technological change. It will also contribute to our understanding of the patterns of unemployment and social exclusion, by bringing together researchers from the fields of international trade and labour economics with specialists in income distribution, focusing in particular on the relationship between inequality in the distribution of wages and the distribution of incomes across households. This relationship seems to be an important factor in explaining the very different ways in which inequality manifests itself in Europe and the US. This has implications for policies designed to address inequality and exclusion in Europe: policy prescriptions based on the US experience may be seriously flawed if applied within Europe. Finally we will attempt to integrate this analysis of trade, inequality and unemployment with newly emerging techniques within the field of political economy, attempting to clarify the relationship between attitudes towards redistribution and the political feasibility of policies designed to address the problems of inequality, social exclusion and unemployment, whether through redistribution or reforms to the operation of labour markets.   The proposed thematic network will bring together, over a 3-year period, researchers based at 5 leading European research institutes as well researchers associated with the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR). The activities of the network will be guided by a scientific committee and coordinated by CEPR. Each participating institution will be responsible for organizing one of the network's 6 workshops, which will focus on the particular expertise of that institution. Papers presented at the workshops will be circulated in the Centre's Discussion Paper Series and the workshop will be reported in its Bulletin and on its Web site. The network will be concluded with a conference in the third year, organized by CEPR, which will summarize and synthesize its achievements. We envisage that the papers presented at the conference will be published in the CEPR conference volume series.",1,1

OBJECTIVES PRISMA will promote a citizen-driven Europe based on innovative approaches to modernising citizens services, by: 1. mapping overall trends and changes affecting citizen services over a 10 year time horizon; 2. identifying current best practice in the provision of citizen services and relevant cross-cutting themes; 3. elaborating long-term visions over 10 years for the provision of citizen services and in relation to selected themes; 4. conducting foresight and scenario-building exercises looking forward over the next 10 years for these services and themes; 5. developing new models of service delivery based upon future-oriented best practice models for these services and themes; 6. providing practical tools for policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders; 7. disseminating project results widely within Key Action I and the IST Programme and out to stakeholder groups; 8. supporting and assisting RTD and other Key Action I projects by providing on-going results and data.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK PRISMA's methodology will be based on mapping major trends and changes affecting citizen services in order to assess current best practice. This will be used to undertake foresight and scenario-building exercises in the context of long-term visions, and to generate future-oriented best practice models, both for the service fields represented in Key Action I as well as for important cross-cutting themes: (1) service models: one core model each for health, persons with special needs (including the disabled and the elderly), administrations, environment, transport and tourism; (2) thematic models which cut across the service models and look at more general and critical themes and issues, e.g. public-private partnerships, self-service provision, sectoral and organisational change, management and competence systems, user-involvement and interfaces, financing and cost-benefits, technology and standards, etc. These will be finally determined during the project to reflect current and changing issues, enabling synergy across all Key Action I services to be developed, something not possible by examining just one or two services. The methodology used to develop these future-oriented best practice models will not be a traditional linear process but instead a parallel, iterative approach in which the analysis is not sequentially fixed but which allows each factor to play off against other factors on a number of occasions during the research process. This 'spiral' research process, as opposed to the traditional linear one, is both iterative and developmental. In this way, each best practice description and model will be refined using at least five generic iterative factors: socio-economic, legal and regulatory frameworks, cultural environments, user and other stakeholder requirements and interests, IST trends. On the basis of this work, PRISMA will develop a tool box, data and methods for RTD projects and relevant stakeholders. The work will be underpinned by close collaboration with expert and thematic panels, using selected test beds to feed into the project and assess its results, as well as other European cases. An independent Advisory Panel will monitor overall work and results.",0,0
17,220579,Yes,Welfare for Migrant Factory Workers: Moral Struggles and Politics of Care under Market Socialism,"The transformation of China and Vietnam from centrally planned economies into today’s market economies has been fuelled by the labour of millions of migrant factory workers from rural areas. These countries started reforming at the turn of the 1980s, embracing marketisation while remaining under the Communist party’s political monopoly, a system now commonly termed market socialism. In what seems to be a reversal of the wider trends of austerity, there has been rapid expansion of social protection, much like what has been happening in other Global South contexts. While the shifts indicate state and societal responses to the social conflict and tension induced by marketization, they in turn have been foregrounded by the politics around how different groups of people should be cared for, politics that are part of wider moral struggles between actors in the new economy. Given their underclass status and their salience as a social force, the question of the migrant factory workers’ welfare is critical for the understanding of the on-going shifts in these countries’ welfare systems. WelfareStruggles is aimed at uncovering the politics of care underlying the provision of welfare for migrant factory workers in China and Vietnam. It does so through a comparative investigation that has two ground-breaking features: 1) the combination of ethnography with comparative social policy analysis, and 2) a translocal approach that takes into account the workers and their families’ negotiation for welfare across the city and the countryside. The comparison is expected to generate path-breaking knowledge about the variable moral dynamics of market socialist welfare. The knowledge will be essential for understanding the momentous yet little-known transformations of Global South welfare and has wider relevance to policy makers and organisations working with analysing and formulating solutions to the welfare needs of the migrant labour force in Vietnam, China and beyond.",1,1
64,205433,Yes,Expectations and Social Influence Dynamics in Economics,"Expectations play a crucial role in determining the behaviour of many economic decision makers. The recent financial and economic crisis has highlighted the importance of expectation dynamics for economic development, the success of firm strategies and public policies. The Innovative Training Network ExSIDE aims at improving our understanding of the role of expectation formation and social influence for economic dynamics and for the optimal design of economic policy.  This agenda will be pursued by combining an interdisciplinary research agenda with an innovative European joint doctoral training programme, which provides Early Stage Researchers with a broad range of expertise and skills needed for a thorough analysis of expectation formation processes and their role in Economics. Both the research projects and the training activities will combine work in Behavioural Economics, Psychoanalysis, Opinion Formation, Network Theory, Agent-based Simulation and Economic Modelling in different areas. The academic training will be complemented by extensive Transferable Skills Training Measures, Inter-Sectoral Training Measures, provided by non-academic partners, and Career Development Training. Interaction with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public will play an important role in pursuing the ExSIDE agenda and disseminating the results. The ExSIDE consortium consists of eight leading European universities and nine non-academic partners. Each Early Stage Researcher will be hosted by two universities, has a secondment with a non-academic partner and will graduate with a joint or double degree. The research and training in ExSIDE will ensure world-wide employability of the ExSIDE graduates inside and outside academia and will also boost the ability of European institutions and companies to develop efficient policies and strategies. ExSIDE will reinforce the establishment and long term sustainability of structured European joint doctoral programmes in Economics.",1,1
850,108649,No,Toxic protein aggregation in neurodegeneration,"Formation of amyloid-like protein aggregates is the hallmark of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, but how the aggregation process is linked with cytotoxicity and cell death remains unclear. The goal of this pro¬ject is to elucidate the basic mechanisms of aggregate toxicity and how it affects the biological system in its entirety. We will analyse cell culture and mouse models of Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclero¬sis and Alzheimer’s disease using a trans-disciplinary approach combining cellular biochemistry, quantita¬tive proteomics and 3D cryo-electron tomography. The effects of aggregating protein species (APS) formed by designer proteins and authentic disease proteins will be compared to define general and disease-specific toxicity mechanisms. The main aims of this project are: 1. To determine the sequence of cellular events occurring during toxic protein aggregation. Live cell imaging and single molecule fluorescence fluctuation measurements will be employed to monitor how APS evolve from diffusible oligomers to large inclusions and quantitative proteomics will define signatures for cells with different forms of aggregates. 2. To identify the mechanisms of aggregation toxicity through a systematic interactome analysis of APS in cell culture and mouse brain. The cellular localization of APS and their potential association with membrane structures and cellular machinery will be determined by cryo-ET. 3. To elucidate why cellular protein quality control fails in neurodegenerative disease. Specially designed proteostasis sensors will be used to monitor the status of the protein folding machinery as aggregate pathol¬ogy develops. The potentially protective pathways of inclusion body formation will be explored using cryo-ET and laser capture dissection coupled with highly sensitive proteomics. Understanding aggregation toxicity will be invaluable in developing novel therapeutic strategies for some of the most debilitating diseases of our time.",0,0

668,227898,No,Resource wars in an unequal world: international law and beyond,"The growing demand for resource commodities, coupled with the climate crisis, have increased pressures on ecosystems and individuals who are already at the margins of society. Conflicts over natural resources and the environment are considered among the greatest challenges of the 21st-century. While the link between resource scarcity or wealth and armed violence is increasingly discussed by political scientists, there is still little understanding of how international law operates in this venue of global governance, where power imbalances shape relations among different actors (transnational corporations, governments, international institutions, and peoples). By conducting two case-studies, which focus on the problem of ‘conflict resources’ and the security impacts of climate change, this project will illuminate international law’s role in framing these types of conflicts and finding ways to tackle them, and the place of different actors within legal discourses. It will demonstrate how distributive concerns may be sidelined and inequalities perpetuated through legal/institutional arrangements. This project will open intellectual spaces to rethink common ‘solutions’ to the international legal order’s most pressing concerns: the ecological crisis, rising civil wars, and their interaction. It will initiate a more inclusive and much-needed debate about alternative understandings of international peace and security, which reflect the lived-experiences of peoples in the Global South. Through the integration of other disciplines into the study and critique of international law, this project presents the opportunity to open a new field of knowledge, which will spark the interest of different constituencies (e.g. legal, political, IR scholars), and aligns with the interdisciplinary character of research at the HO.",0,0

861,8634,No,Extended Office Process Migration with Interactive Panel Displays,"PROMINAND is an integrated approach for supporting cooperative office work. The approach was based on a concept of office worker-influenced migration of office processes and a novel panel display device. A supportive human factors analysis and evaluation to optimise office worker satisfaction was also carried out.  The extended office process migration with interactive panel displays' (PROMINAND) migration system (MS) supports cooperation between office workers by controlling the migration of office processes through an organization. A typical office process consists of steps which are performed in parallel or sequentially. It is represented by an electronic circulation folder (ECF), which can be opened and closed, onto which a folder slip can be put, into which appendices can be added, and so on. The MS controls ECF circulation to office workers playing office roles by taking into account both organizational structures and organizational rules for dealing with office tasks. Control covers both the formally described circulation of ECFs and the handling of exceptions.  The flow of work is the one aspect of office tasks; the other side is the intrinsic work to be performed, divided into steps. The MS supports this work by the automatic invocation of appropriate application dependent programs which are referred to in a migration sepcification. PROMINAND's interactive panel device (IPD) is a computer controlled novel electronic device which consists of a set of building blocks comprising intelligent display and feedback elements.

The focus is: - to measure exposure concentrations, including exposure measurements to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), at the point of contact between the human receptor and the physical and chemical pollution and to help define the important and critical routes of exposure; - to participate in CEN/CENELEC standardisation activities and to contribute to tobacco regulation issues (registration and assessment of tobacco additives, evaluation of ISO standards for tobacco smoke); - to evaluate science and policy issues related to human exposure; - to characterise the chemical, physical and biological stressors encountered by humans and to describe and to model the relationship of that exposure in space and time; - to assess the impact of materials, furnishing and products on human exposure in commercial, residential and occupational environments; - to optimise abatement according to effectiveness or society benefits for sustainable development; - to construct integrated decision tools for the reduction and abatement of physical and chemical exposure. Planned Deliverables  Deliverables in 2002  Specific deliverables to DGs: - Report on strategies to evaluate the impact of indoor air pollution on human exposure; - Labelling schemes for material emissions (low emitting, non -toxic for the use in indoor environments) - Mapping of UV-B exposure for the last 15 years in Europe; - Compilation of total column ozone and UV-B data; set up of the European Reference Centre for UV Measurements; - Report on the inter-comparison of models for environmental noise; - Set up of the European Reference Laboratory for EMF measurements; interim report of the 'pan-European study on EMF exposure from GSM/GPRS/UMTS base stations'; - Preliminary Results on Exposure Measurements within the ADA project.  As a result of the research: - Report on the testing (in the INDOORTRON facility) of novel, environmentally friendly photo-catalytic materials for indoor/outdoor applications to reduce exposure to chemical pollutants.  Summary of 2001 Deliverables: 31/12/2001  The deliverables listed below were achieved in the frame of the Integrated Air Quality Assessment (IAQA) project during 2001 (until August 31st). Due to the re-structuring of the JRC (taken place on September 1st) the IAQA project was split up in two parts. One part (European Reference Laboratory for Air Pollution - ERLAP and the ISPRA EMEP station) has been transferred to the already existing project CORSE of the new unit Emissions and Health, and the climate change unit respectively. The second part including indoor exposure, UV measurements and noise together with exposure-based assessments from electromagnetic fields makes the basis for the new project UNIE. (See deliverables below).  Position paper on Ambient Air Pollution by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)-July 27th, 2001- prepared by the Working Group on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for the Directorate General of the Environment.  The European Collaborative Action (ECA) Report No. 23 on 'Identification of risk sub-groups in non-industrial indoor environments' (currently in print).  Mid-status report on 'Comparison among existing computation methods for prediction of road traffic and railway noise'.  Workshop on Quality Assurance/Quality Control in Laboratories Performing Deposition Analyses for Atmospheric Pollutants ( in the frame of the Pan-European Programme of Intensive Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems- May 14-16, 2001- in collaboration with DG AGRI ).  Output Indicators and Impact  - European standard methods of measurement and product specification. - Contribution to the Commission's policy for the mitigation and reduction of exposures to toxic pollutants; - Formulation and implementation of directives related to environmental noise; - Formulation and implementation of directives related to electromagnetic fields; - Central role in the European perspective on standardisation of UV data; - Development and testing of new building materials with consumer-friendly properties to be applied in indoor/ outdoor environments. Summary of the project  The UNIE project concentrates several activities of the former JRC-44 IAQA project in addition to some new activities in electromagnetic fields. The main objective is the development, validation, harmonisation and standardisation of assessment methods and models for quantifying total human exposure to stressors. These methods and models are the most critical tools needed in exposure estimates and risk assessment within current and future EU policies regarding the environmental and health impact of stressors, including chemical, biological and physical agents (noise, UV radiation, and electromagnetic fields). The work is being carried out in dedicated laboratories specialised on the different types of exposure pathways and stressors. These are being developed to act in their respective areas as Reference Laboratories at EU level to improve the currently achievable quality, representative ness and comparability of measured data related to consumer and occupational exposure:  See also the related EU enlargement process pre-accession (pa) project.  Rationale  Population exposure to environmental stressors strongly affects well being and increases health risk. One of the fundamental aims of the European Treaty is to ensure a high level of protection of the European citizens. This gives the JRC a clear mandate to accurately evaluate the risk of European citizens deriving from the exposure to chemicals, biological and physical environmental stressors. In order to develop good policies the Commission needs sound scientific knowledge on occurrence and nature, source strengths, and dispersion of these stressors.  In the frame of the UNIE project human exposure is seen as a holistic approach, which includes estimates and assessment of indoor exposures due to the impact of chemicals (e.g. VOC), biological (e.g. funghi, moulds) and physical agents (e.g. UV, noise, EMF-indoor/outdoor) as the basis for the development and implementation of: - common measurement methods and protocols; - common exposure models and; - exposure guidelines.  Chemicals and Biological Contaminants:  Exposure estimates and assessment are carried out using advanced instrumentation and facilities (INDOORTRON) and through the execution of pilot studies in indoor environments at European level. Current focus on air exposure and indoor air quality will be progressively complemented by activities on other exposure routes for substances released from products throughout the whole life cycle.  Environmental Noise:  The principal focus is the establishment of a reference laboratory (operational within 2002) for the validation and harmonisation of measuring methods for noise, from road, railway traffic and industrial sites. Measuring campaigns for model inter-comparison and validation are planned. A Europe-wide network has been established.  UV- Radiation:  The UV monitoring activity will be expanded with a strong effort to develop quality control methodologies and procedures to increase the accuracy of UV measurements. In this frame the development of the European Reference Laboratory for UV measurements has been started.  Electromagnetic Fields:  The focus is on measuring human exposure from all different EMF sources, including base stations, mobile telephony hand-sets, electro-domestic appliances. The activity started in September 2001 with the establishment of an expert network and the planning of a pan-European study on EMF exposure from GSM/GPRS/UMTS base stations. An equipped laboratory is expected to become operational at the end of 2002.",0,0

This project is based on Vaesken and Zafiropoulou model centered to social innovation resulting from the articulation between modes of governance and modes of regulation.  The program treats three specific research orientations of social policies and local development: 1. Cultural policies (cultural management, place of users in the construction of cultural policies, innovating systems and devices). This axis points the difficulty in taking into account the requests of stakeholders in the construction of cultural policies building oriented to social regulation. 2. Healthcare policies (centered on active participation of users, innovating systems and devices of management in isolated territories). This axis analyzes news relationships, partnerships and services characterizing the healthcare sector, having for goal to manage medical territories. 3. Policies of social and economic integration of disadvantaged populations (innovating systems and devices of management). Within the framework of the social and professional integration it is important to study the roles of private and public operators in order to specify different types of configurations. These configurations aim to answer problems of social and economic insertion.  Moreover, a transverse axis on home care and integrated services will be developed. This multidisciplinary research project integrates both economic, public policies and public management approaches.

Confronting a macro-soc ial perspective with a micro-social analysis, the research explores the levels of variety and evolution of the work-welfare nexus central to wage relations. A first objective is to compare across European countries changes in job, wage and income structure s for employees between 1994 and 2000 using statistical data from the European Household Panel. A second objective is to analyse firms' practices in pay package and welfare provision within different societal contexts in two key sectors of activity. Outcom es of the research are expected to contribute to European research on job quality, changes in work and social cohesion, and to enrich an original comparative and trans-disciplinary analytical framework which has been elaborated by the fellow over the last post-doctoral research.

It seeks to boost innovati ve thinking and to assess the existing regional approaches for innovation in order to propose a common European innovation methodology based on the project studies in 5 different European regions. The overall objective of the RIPA project is to develop a c omprehensive and coherent methodology for assessing different regional policies on research and innovation, which can contribute to improving the regional understanding of effective innovation policy measures in a European context. In connection with this, a set of benchmarking indicators will be defined and a benchmarking tool developed in order to allow the trans-regional comparison of the impact of different strategies and policies on innovation performance. The aim is to improve the policy-making proces s by involving a critical mass of politicians, researchers, industry representatives and other promoters of regional innovation to ensure commitment and permanent integration of the project results into regional policy-making procedures. The project bases its regional commitment on a strong public-private partnership principle in pursuing successful innovation strategies. A key issue of the project objectives, and an expected force of the project, is to obtain new knowledge about the dependency of actors in regional settings. Analysing behavioural aspects can have a large impact on the successful outcome of innovation policies. The aspect of networking and actor-focused analysis is a challenge as it is often based on informal contacts and relation, and often it can prove predominant for success. Network-based development plans and the behaviour of the involved actors will be investigated. The MERIPA project will be a mutual learning platform.",0,0
259,100879,Yes,Workers' organization in the informal sector,"The research proposal aims at offering new insights into precarious workers’ self-organising and collective resistance under globalised capitalism. Through in-depth ethnographic studies in the informal sector economy of the city of Buenos Aires, the research will explore the forms, methods, alliances and organizational models, used by workers to counter-oppose their precarious working and income conditions. Precariousness, informality, fragmentation, insecurity and inequality are becoming increasingly dominant patterns of employment not just in a developing country like Argentina but also across Europe.  Within this context, further strengthened by the current economic crisis, not just the Lisbon strategy of making Europe competitive through more and better jobs needs to be reviewed  but also makes reality predictions of a ‘brazilianization’ of dominant economies, seen as increasingly dominated by an economic scenario based on informality and  precariousness . Thus, in this perspective the analysis of informal work in the city of Buenos Aires may reflect a not far too distant future for the social cohesion and employment conditions of Europe, calling governments and social institutions to take action.  At the same time, it invites trade unions to move beyond purely institutional policy making roles and toward strategies and actions to enlarge the representation of workers in precarious employment.",1,1
992,195807,No,"Innovation Systems in Financial Crisis: Technological Dynamics, Industrial Structure and Business Cycles","This research project will investigate from an empirical, theoretical and normative perspective the impact of financial crisis on innovation systems, and in particular knowledge networks and technology clusters, and by extension, on technological trajectories, industrial dynamics and economic growth of afflicted EU economies. It will also explore the latent link between technological dynamics and business cycles, and examine to what extent a strategic mix of RTDI, industrial and regional policies can address structural causes of crises and foment techno-economic development by building the capacities of innovation systems and bridging the technology gap.  The project will apply econometric modelling, network analysis, and computational simulations at various geographical scales, from NUTS-3 regions to the EU as a whole, focusing on three Southern European countries (Spain, Portugal and Greece). At the theoretical level, it aspires to bridge the gap between neo-Schumpeterian technological dynamics and post-Keynesian macroeconomics with endogenous fluctuations, and to build an agent-based model of an innovation system for policy simulation. This is expected to shed light on the latent link between business cycles and technology gaps, to gauge the technological impact of financial crises, and to assess alternative policy responses under different institutional settings. The project is highly topical in the context of post-crisis EU policy discourse on the future of ERA, the Innovation Union initiative and Europe 2020 growth strategy, and it can advance the design of ‘knowledge governance’ policy instruments for crisis-hit EU periphery, thus having a positive societal impact. It is also designed to boost the researcher’s academic career restart, to consolidate his expertise in the field of innovation and technology economics, and to enrich his research skills by providing advanced training and opportunities for international research collaborations and dissemination.",1,0
230,51215,Yes,New econometric model for environment and strategies implementation for sustainable development,"Problems to be solved The economic evaluation of environmental policies, of different regulation strategies, is generally made with Applied General Equilibrium Models, which are well suited for long-term analyses, and for the implementation of economic instruments. The inadequacy of such instruments to fill certain tasks is well known. In general, these models are calibrated and non-econometrically estimated, this prevent them for forecasts; they are less efficient to describe short and medium term consequences of policies. From that point of view, the econometric neo-Keynesian models are more suited for this kind of analyses, with of course some limits that are well known. For these reasons, it is very important to have two different methodological advices on evaluation of environmental policies, and to develop this second family of models. The Commission did finance building of the Econometric E3ME model, which treats 19 EU regions and 30 sectors, but in spite of its characteristics, which give a real capability to evaluate environmental policies, the model is today in a state which prevents an efficient exploitation adequate to the investment realised in the past. The main problem to be solved is to transform and update this model so as to restore its capability to treat some policy cases related to greenhouse gas emissions strategies. At first the research will be centralized on the economic consequences of modification of the duties on energy products as it was proposed by the E.C. A second work will be implemented on the R&D policies for competitiveness, employment and sustainable development. The work will be grounded on a subsidy policy on R&D in European countries. A third work is the development of the model to implement tradable permits and to evaluate permit trading under the Kyoto Protocol. Scientific objectives and approach The scientific objectives of the project follows four main paths. The first one is to implement the former E3ME model to new software called IODE and to update the model and its data basis. The second one is to build a new environmental module so as to capture new environmental phenomena. The third will be to implement in the model recent developments of economic theories such as R&D and perfect foresight effects. For the last development, the software has to be updated to incorporate a new algorithm already developed in one of the team, which permits to solve perfect foresight models rather quickly. And at least, the fourth path will be to test the whole model with simulations, to create a baseline forecast and to realise all the policy analyses explained above. Expected impacts We can say here that there is a clear need for such an instrument, which really works, and different from the GEM-E3 approach, in order to deliver : a baseline scenario for economic activities, energy demand and energy related emission of pollutants, an analysis of the effects of greenhouse gas abatement policies on industrial innovation, on competitiveness and on employment, an analysis of various incentives for energy efficiency and policies, an analysis of modifications of fiscal systems to regulate environment and increase employment (Double dividend debate), for instance, increase in the excise duty which can allows a reduction of taxes burden on Labor, an analysis of the propositions of regulation post Kyoto, the burden sharing, the use of economic instruments such as tradable permits and taxation, and at least the analysis of coordinated policies versus uncoordinated policies in Europe. All these questions give an insight of the capability of such an instrument, a detailed sectoral and environmental econometric model to evaluate socio-economic and environmental impacts of different policies in Europe. The main potential for the exploitation of the results of the project, lies in the use of an improved user friendly sectoral model which incorporates some phenomena described by new theories of production, and which can describe the behaviour of agents in term of maximization with rational expectations (Perfect Foresight), to be in tune with the recent developments of economic analysis. The sectoral aspects can be useful to the industrial decision makers. Its environmental module, at a European level, will be helpful to the international negotiation that our countries will have to face during the next years, and to give evaluation of public policies which are related to environmental purposes",0,1
1074,193186,No,Characterizing Atrial fibrillation by Translating its Causes into Health Modifiers in the Elderly,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with a prevalence of 1.5-2% in European populations. By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke – treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients’ outcome.  The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will  1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe,  2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and  3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",0,0
378,86509,Yes,Trade preferences and the role of institutional quality in economic integration,"Firms and industries differ in their capacities to engage in export and import activities, to enter into foreign markets. Some firms/industries are more successful in taking advantage of preferential market access or entering into foreign markets. This research project aims to explore cross-industry/cross-firm variation in export performance and ability to enter into foreign markets with special emphasis on the role of institutions, governance and trade preferences.  Thus the project will evolve along two main axes. First it will evaluate trade preferences at sectoral level taking into account various factors including institutional quality and rules of origin. This would result in the development of a new sectoral level dataset and a novel econometric technique. Second, it will look at the effects of quality of governance and institutions on firms ability to enter into foreign markets and to establish links with foreign markets through mergers and acquisitions.",1,1
718,85102,No,Advanced seismic acquisition and processing,"This TOK Development Host scheme project proposes a two-way transfer of knowledge between the oilfield services industry in a developed EU region, and geophysical academia in a less favoured region of the EU. The ultimate goal of this collaboration will see Eötvös Loránd Geophysical Institute (ELGI in Hungary) with technologically skilled experts, internationally visible, who can apply the newly developed remote sensing methods in their scientific projects for detailed characterisation of the Earth's structure. At the same time, Schlumberger Cambridge Research (SCR in the U.K.) and WesternGeco (WG in Norway) will benefit from the newly developed algorithms and practices for their oilfield services businesses.  All parties will further benefit from mutual cultural interaction. Sustainable development is a main research priority of the EU, and this project aims to develop advanced land seismic acquisition techniques as an effective tool for solving these problems. In the EU host country, Hungary, current applications are for the definition of the sub-surface for nuclear waste repositories, and for the mapping of the subsurface for geothermal potential.  Current applications for SCR and WG are in reservoir monitoring, CO2 storage and sequestration, and exploration technology.  The project will be coordinated by the host, ELGI, where the original theoretical idea was developed. Secondments of both experienced and more experienced scientists are planned to EGLI, SCR and WG.  In addition to the core technical work of the project, additional technical and training lectures, for example: technical fundamentals, company profiles, intellectual property, and project management, will be held at all sites.",0,0

824,207220,No,SPIDIA for Personalized Medicine - Standardisation of generic Pre-analytical procedures for In-vitro DIAgnostics for Personalized Medicine,"Molecular in vitro diagnostics and biomedical research have allowed great progress in personalised medicine but further progress is limited by insufficient guidelines for pre-analytical workflow steps (sample collection, preservation, storage, transport, processing etc.) as well as by insufficient quality assurance of diagnostic practice. This allows using compromised patients’ samples with post collection changes in cellular and extra-cellular biomolecules’ profiles thus often making diagnostic test results unreliable or even impossible. To tackle this, SPIDA4P aims to generate and implement a comprehensive portfolio of 22 pan-European pre-analytical CEN/Technical Specifications and ISO/International Standards, addressing the important pre-analytical workflows applied to personalized medicine. These will also applicable to biomarker discovery, development and validation as well as to biobanks. Corresponding External Quality Assurance (EQA) Schemes will be developed and implemented as well, aiming to survey the resulting quality of samples and diagnostic practice. SPIDIA4P will ensure stakeholder organisations involvements as well as training, education, and counselling as additional major foci of the project. The consortium will closely coordinate with large European public research consortia to obtain access to research and validation studies data serving as evidence for the new standards developments and achieved improvements of diagnosis, patient stratification and prognosis of disease outcome.  At this crucial moment in the development of personalised medicine, SPIDIA4P proposes a coordination and support action that reunites 19 highly experienced partners in international standardisation for in vitro diagnostics, coming from private industry including SMEs, public institutions and from one official European Standards Organisation. This strong consortium is balanced and empowered to maximise the impacts of in vitro diagnostics on personalised medicine.",0,0
957,94125,No,Protective Responsive Outer Shell for People in Industrial Environments,"In the Prospie project a new generation of work wear will be developed and produced. Special features of the work wear will be a dynamic cooling system in order to prevent workers from hyperthermia, smart interfaces for measuring essential physical parameters of workers and their work place and the data processing resulting in the swift identification of (potential) dangerous situations. The data processing will be based on algorithms which take personal aspects of the worker into consideration. When critical limits are exeeded, the worker will be alerted by (tactile) actuators. In case there is no reaction, rescue workers will be alerted. The personal safety system provided by the work wear will become an integrated part of industrial safety systems. In the project much attention will be paid to the safety of the worker, the comfort of the work wear(thermo-physiological and ergonomic) , the reliability of the smart functions, the production technology, care and maintenance, training of users and potential buyers (public procurement) and standardization issues concerning this new generation of PPE. The Prospie-project will support the EU in realizing the goals set in the EU-leadmarket initiative on protective clothing and strenghten the position of the EU-textile and clothing industry. Most important however is the expected reduction of work related accidents through the early warning system in potential dangerous situations, resulting in a substantial reduction of accidents related absence from work, disturbance in production processes and the increased productivity of workers in (hot) industrial environments. It is expected that the results of the Prospie project can be transferred to other sectors like first responders (fire men police, para-medicals), sports and healthcare for elderly and patients in nursing houses",1,0

333,212278,Yes,Paternity leave and the gender gap in pay and earnings,"This project will estimate the impact of the gender split in parental leave on gender gaps in labour market outcomes and domestic work. I will address this topic, which is of Europe-wide policy relevance, by examining the parental leave policy in Germany. To provide causal estimates, I will make use of variation in the gender split in leave that is due to a cap in the income-related benefit payments at 1,800€ per month. A preliminary step for the analysis, is to confirm empirically that the cap in parental leave benefits does in fact induce variation in the gender split of leave. Following on from this, the main analysis will make use of differences in the gender split in leave that result specifically from the benefit cap in order to answer two questions:  Question 1. What is the impact of the gender split in parental leave on the within-household gender gap in labour market outcomes (pay, hours, earnings and employment)?  Question 2. What is the impact of the gender split in parental leave on the household division of domestic work and childcare?  By answering these questions in a causal sense I address a literature gap in three areas. Firstly, there is currently no evidence on the effect of the gender split of parental leave on the gender gap in pay and only non-causal evidence for the effects on other labour market outcomes such as employment. Secondly, there is only non-causal evidence on the effects of the split of leave on the gender gaps in domestic work and childcare. Finally, there is no evidence on the effect of financial incentives on the split of leave and subsequent gender gaps in labour market outcomes and the division of domestic work and childcare.",1,1
124,32337,Yes,Co-operative multidimensional multimedia topological elements reintegration,"Public administrations are using highly distributed information and data for purposes of ensuring public security, citizen comfort and city management in general. They have a wide range of data bases containing, statistical Geo-referenced data. Such information and data is of paramount importance. It is essential that it is maintained and kept up-to-date.   Many European public authorities are demanding a new type of system which can provide a distributed and co-operative update management of Geo-related information, and, at the same time giving a secure continuity to legacy departmental systems. This new demand of GIS services in standard information system is going to create a new series of Geo-technology. Existing data base update solutions are vendor dependent underlying relational database system giving access to proprietary repository.  In this context the goal of the project is develop software services to support integration of Geo-data transformations and to support transactions that can be executed by remote distributed servers in a transparent way and to demonstrate and assess the usability of the system. For this purpose, four user organisations (from France, Italy and Germany) are directly participating in this project. They have been chosen because as representative sample of this business sector concerning the size (due to large volume of information and data that are dealt with), and geographical coverage. It will enable continuity of office databases, avoid users manually transferring data between their workplace and the central data bases office and enhance the use of updated information.  COMMUTER services are realised on the top of the following: information access and retrieval, exploration enabling, real-time or differed-time updating and feedback-generation, monitoring and process management.  The technical approach of the project consists of three phases. Phase 1 is devoted to the specification of user requirements, system design and the design of three applications for Geo-related data update. They will be land registry information, network information, environmental information handling. In phase 2 the project will design and develop tools for user interface, underlying services for updating Geo-related data (respectively semantic references, data history, cartographic data) in connected target systems. Phase 3 of the project will implement three applications and validate them in a real setting. It will be concerned with practicality, user acceptance, reliability and extendibility. The impact of project to the European Industry is twofold:  - Interoperability of software components in a distributed environment (DBMS and GIS) to standardise processes and interfaces. This is crucial for the players in the European GIS arena which is a niche and dynamic market serving national needs. - Transformation and Transaction Management Language specification represent a big step towards standardisation for data transfers across national and organisational boundaries in Europe.  COMMUTER will deliver a Geo-data update management system. It will be a distributed framework to change visual cartographic repositories, when managed by several actors in parallel. Technology providers can exploit both the software tools for implementing data update solutions for geographic data, data history and semantic references in a secured way and also the innovative methods regarding data bases update management process for providing value added technical assistance. Four user partners can exploit the applications and can benefit from sharing data, knowledge and resources of updated information.  Industrial partners aim to exploit the project results. They are co-operating in the development of software components specific to the needs of Public Administration. The project users group, already list several hundred installation. There is an agreement with the central headquarters to install the infrastructure in all local offices as soon as software solutions are available.",0,1
319,79848,Yes,Scanning Policy Scenarios for the Transition to Sustainable Economic Structures,"The focus of this research project will be to scan a wide range of policy scenarios as to their relevance for the European Sustainable Development Strategy in view of Extended Impact Assessment. Embedded in the TranSust network of researchers, with its expertise in modelling the transition to sustainable economic structures, the project will link and expand an extensive set of available models. Using a scenario approach in cooperation with stakeholders, these models will address the strategic policy options.  In a first step, existing models will be extended to reflect the multi-functionality aspect of sustainability policies and their trade-offs with other policies. In addition to the traditional economic, environmental and social issues, the expanded models will address the new policy agenda as put forward by the Lisbon Strategy of the European Union and the World Summit for Economic Development. The models will therefore be able to deal with competitiveness, economic development, security, the preparations for Beyond-Kyoto policies, and interaction between technological change and the use of natural resources.  In a second step, this enhanced set of models will be used for a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of policy scenarios. In designing the scenarios, a participatory approach will emphasise close cooperation with stakeholders, Commission services, and international organisations. By back-casting the path dependency and by simulating the range of assumptions, the scenario analysis will reveal the sensitivity of forecasts.  The methodology and databases will be made available to institutions involved in policy decision-making. TranSust.Scan aims to enhance European competence and expertise for dealing with the emerging extended facets of sustainability and their implications for policy design. Besides supporting strategic policy preparation for the European Union, the dissemination activities will address non-European institutions.",0,1
