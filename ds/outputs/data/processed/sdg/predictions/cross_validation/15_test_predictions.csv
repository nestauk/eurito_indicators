890,188197,No,The interplay between innate immunity and RNA interference in mammals,"In antiviral RNAi, the DICER (DCR) enzyme processes virus-derived double-stranded (ds)RNA into siRNAs that guide ARGONAUTE proteins to silence complementary viral RNA. As a counter-defense, viruses deploy viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs). Well-established in plants and invertebrates, the existence of antiviral RNAi in mammals has remained unknown until our recent findings (from my first postdoctoral studies) that undifferentiated mouse cells infected with Encephalomyocarditis virus or Nodamuravirus accumulate 22-nt long siRNAs. These derived from viral dsRNA replication-intermediates, incorporated into AGO2, were eliminated in Dcr knockout cells, and decreased in abundance upon cell differentiation. We further showed that genetically ablating a NoV-encoded VSR that antagonizes DCR during authentic infections reduces NoV accumulation, which is rescued in RNAi-deficient mouse cells. We concluded that antiviral RNAi operates in mammalian cells. One of the key findings from this study was that antiviral RNAi operates in undifferentiated but not in differentiated cells. Our main hypothesis for this discrepancy is that, in mammalian cells, virus infection triggers other defense systems that are not sequence-specific by nature -such as the interferon (IFN) response- and that these defense pathway may mask the effects of RNAi. Accordingly long dsRNA-triggered RNAi is active in mESCs, which are known to be defective in their IFN response. Alternatively, DCR and/or its cofactors involved in dsRNA processing might be insufficient in differentiated cells. The aim of this proposal is, therefore, to establish whether antiviral RNAi can be revealed in differentiated cells genetically-deficient for different components of the IFN pathway and/or modified to express appropriate levels of factors involved in the processing of dsRNA. We hope to conclusively demonstrate that antiviral RNAi remains active in differentiated cells but is dampened by the superimposition of the IFN response.",0,0
983,105959,No,Electro-thermal Laminar Wing Ice Protection System Demonstrator,"This proposal regards designing, building and testing a functional prototype of part of a laminar wing fitted with electro-thermal ice protection (ETIPS) for a business jet.  The aim is to show innovation in the use of composite materials for the fixed leading edge, (e.g. Fibre/Metal Laminates), which are thermally efficient, can be manufactured to tight laminar wing tolerances and comparable to aluminium for weight & cost.  Furthermore, the structure will be evaluated for its basic damage resistance properties and ease of repair. The ETIPS aspects will be innovative through a focus on minimising power consumption, using sensors to allow power demand management and thereby achieve a Smart ETIPS.  Different types of heater elements will be tested in a range of configurations to optimise ice protection coverage and power consumption.  Trials will also be conducted to minimise the weight of the ETIPS heater elements, controllers and wiring. Several structural and layout trade-off studies will be conducted and the final solution tested in an icing wind tunnel.",0,0
107,198692,Yes,Ecological determinants of tropical-temperate trends in insect diversity,"The study will examine one of the most fundamental, yet poorly understood patterns of global biodiversity distribution: How can so many species coexist in a tropical forest? This key question of current ecology will be studied using quantitative surveys of plant-herbivore-parasitoid food webs within paired sets of tropical and temperate forests from six continents, in Papua New Guinea (PNG), Gabon, Panama, the Czech Republic, Japan, and USA, sampled using canopy cranes, truck-mounted elevated platforms and forest felling. This novel type of data will be analysed using a new rarefaction method, developed to test mechanistic explanations for biodiversity patterns along ecological gradients. It will evaluate competing hypotheses explaining latitudinal trends in insect herbivore diversity by the variation in either phylogenetic or functional diversity of plants, the host specificity of herbivores, or the diversity and specificity of their parasitoids and predators. The study will thus examine the importance of bottom-up (plants) and top-down (enemies) drivers of latitudinal trends in herbivore food webs, central to ecological theory that postulates the role of specialized herbivores as density-dependent agents of mortality involved in maintaining high tropical plant diversity. The project builds upon prior research that produced one of the largest tropical food web data sets to expand it conceptually, methodologically and geographically. It will build a globally important research facility (a canopy crane in PNG) and link researchers and infrastructure from several countries in a major effort to draw together separate lines of tropical and temperate research. Study sites in the ILTER, NEON, CTFS/SIGEO, and Canopy Crane Network will participate. The internationally recognized paraecologist program will be expanded, PhD students from both European and developing countries will be trained, and conservation of rainforests by indigenous rainforest dwellers will be leveraged.",1,1

113,37402,Yes,COMMON BEECH FOR FORESTATION AND DIVERSIFACTION : DEVELOPMENT OF FORESTATION TECHNIQUES AND ASSESSMENT OF THE GENETIC VARIATION IN REPRODUCTIVE MATERIALS,"Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is an important tree species of Europe, mainly western and Central Europe. It has been gradually reduced in its area already since the middle ages, mainly due to agriculture, but also forestry. Often foresters have replaced beech forests by pure conifer stands like Norway spruce.,Beech forests were regenerated mainly naturally, while planting was not common. Because Common Agriculture Policy results in the abandoning of large areas of agricultural lands, much of this land is to be forested. From the soil and climate index often beech is best suited. Techniques of replanting beech on open abandoned agricultural lands have failed frequently because of adverse soil conditions (due to agricultural soil management) and missing protection by a tree canopy. Also, a suitable provenance has to be chosen because at a given'site no trees of the original adapted provenance are left. Beech is and will be increasingly used to stabilise pure coniferous stands by intermixing this tree species. For both, forestation on open farmland and intermixing of conifer stands, techniques are not available to ensure successful forestation at reasonable prices. Another problem is intermittent seed production of beech with 4-8 years elapsing between seed sets. This makes reproductive material of beech a precious commodity. Therefore it is important to prolong its storability from the present maximum time of about 5 years while maintaining viability of the seeds. Objectives of the proposal are: (1) Improvement of methods for procurement of reproductive material, (2) development of efficient forestation methods, and (3) study of the genetic variation and adaptedness of beech provenances to be able to select highly qualified and adapted reproductive material for the various sites to forested. With these objectives the proposal fits under three areas of the FAIR Programme: 'increase of productivity and quality [of forest raw materials] through selection and breeding' (1.3.1.1), 'Adaptation of forests to climatic changes, biodiversity, productivity,' (4.5.3), and 'systems, techniques and plant supply for afforestation' as well as 'breeding and genetic improvement for increment, quality, and resistance' (4.5.4). The proposal is divided into four Tasks: (1) Seed (cryo-) storage, plant production, forestation techniques, and genetic structure of artificial vs. natural stands, (2) Genetic variation of adaptive traits, frost and shade tolerance, abiotic factors and morphological traits (3) Geographic variation of molecular genetic (cpDNA) markers in beech and implications, and (4) Genetic variation among provenances, long term consequences for forestation. Each of the Tasks would be managed by a Task coordinator. New methods and techniques would be applied: cryo-preservation for germplasm (seed) storage, plug-containers for beech plant production, advanced silvicultural techniques, new types of growth chambers for adaptability studies, including a shade hall, modern tree architectural modelling approach, application of molecular biology to study genetic markers, use of llkriging technique' to demonstrate genetic variation over the geographic distribution and develop a prediction model for provenance growth. With the plant material, from national and international provenance field trials, and material from collections of the 'EU-Concerted Action Beech Network', available to different partners of the project, an extensive and reliable material base has been established. It is planned to share material in the different analyses to reach a high information level by correlating parameters of the different characters observed for genetic improvement of beech forestation programmes.",1,1
350,100425,No,Integrated EST Framework,"The aim of the EST-Frame project is to contribute to socially robust and ethically sound research and technology development by providing further methodological development of appropriate tools for social impact assessment and technology evaluation. The project will appraise current assessment methods for evaluating emerging science and technology with the objectives of mapping their strengths and weaknesses and determining their appropriate application domains. It will examine the current policy context for emerging science and technology (EST) policy advice and will identify future trends and needs that should be considered. The project will, in close dialogue with end users, also identify to what extent – and in what contexts –a framework of a more integrated nature can be applied, and it will examine the appropriate position that such an integrated framework can operate in, within a context characterised by internationalisation, market politics, and new forms of public-private partnerships in technology governance. Finally, this work will result in the design of a flexible, integrated framework that is intended to facilitate holistic societal dialogue and reflection and policy advice on emerging science and technologies. This integrated framework can be applied by policy forming actors (economic councils; ethical councils; technology appraisal institutes, government technology assessment boards, etc.) who are involved in the process of conducting analyses and coordinating policy deliberations on the broad range of science and technological developments. The project will use four examples of emerging science and technologies – (1) nanotechnology in food production, (2) synthetic biology, (3) biofuels and (4) security in emerging ICTs – to determine how current frameworks are applied to assess social impacts and then evaluate these assessments in light of the integrated framework. An added value of the project is policy relevant advice on the four cases.",0,0
22,74159,Yes,Improving the quality of European citrus & fruit by developing Medfly SIT technology so it can be widely applied in Europe,"The project aims to develop safer, higher quality food by implementing improved crop protection systems based on the increased use in Europe of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). SIT is based on mass production and release of sterile male insects which mate with wild females, preventing the production of offspring, and causing the pest population to crash. Medfly is a major pest of several key crops in Europe, notably citrus. Use of Medfly SIT in California, Florida, Mexico, Central America & Chile has shown SIT to be cost-effective, environmentally sound and a sustainable alternative to chemical insecticides. In Europe the main control method remains chemical insecticide spraying. Feasibility studies and small scale SIT trials show SIT can be used effectively in European fruit production though technical and practical obstacles hinder its widespread use. European commercial culture, geography and citrus industry structure is different from e.g. the USA. SIT requires specific adaptations and improvements to be widely adopted in Europe. By replacing chemical insecticides SIT reduces chemical residue levels in food. By effective control of the pest it reduces impacts on the food chain. By encouraging biodiversity it supports tourism and alternative land use, and other biological control programs. By controlling quarantine pests it supports exports. Of the biological methods available SIT has the greatest potential to improve the quality of fruit production in Europe (EU Standing Committee on Plant Health, 2001). 3 main advances are needed to enable the widespread adoption of SIT in Europe: Â- Development of decentralised production based on egg-shipping technology Â- Development of field release technologies more suitable for Europe Â- Dissemination of tools and knowledge enabling local organisations to adopt SIT A Consortium of SIT experts will develop technical/scientific tools and measures to address these issues...",1,1
136,63162,Yes,Pollution and recivery of fish farm sediments,"In order to prevent interactions between fish farms and the marine environment showing adverse effects on economy (diseases, low quality) mitigation strategies are urgently needed). One promising strategy is the transfer of fish farms, which might relieve organically burdened sediment leading to improved production) There is, however a lack of information on the effects of these measures, i.e. in semi-enclosed and none-tidal systems. Therefore, a major goal of the proposed work is to characterise and model the change of the benthos at different study sites once the point source of organic enrichment, i.e. the fish farm, has been removed or established, respectively. Specific objectives should include documentation and quantification of the changes occurring in terms of biogeochemistry, benthos, and fish pathogens, and to develop a predictive model to optimise balance between biomass production and product quality.",1,1
674,107277,No,Simulation of Dielectric Spectra,"'Modern spectroscopic techniques allow to measure the frequency dependent dielectric permittivity of complex liquids over about 18 decades, accessing relaxation times ranging from several hours down to the picosecond scale. The central problem in interpreting dielectric spectra is to relate the spectral features to the underlying dynamics of the molecular or atomic components of the fluids. Molecular dynamics simulations could provide in this sense invaluable help. However, a large number of important relaxation processes, responsible for spectral peaks, originate from rare events, the presence of which can severely limit the potential of this simulation technique. Up until now, only standard molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to investigate dielectric spectra, and the capabilities of enhanced sampling techniques such as metadynamics or parallel tempering have been largely neglected in this field. In addition, liquids other than water have received relatively little attention in the framework of computational dielectric spectroscopy, even though plenty of  important problems are still waiting for an answer. I will fill this gap by putting forward an approach which combines the knowledge of the free energy landscape provided by enhanced sampling techniques with the information accessible by molecular dynamics simulations. I will use this novel approach to tackle two compelling problems (the origin of the excess wing in liquid glycerol spectra and the ion pairing properties in room temperature ionic liquids) in the fundamental understanding of two materials which are crucial for the modern economy. The SIDIS approach is expected to have an important impact on the field of computational dielectric spectroscopy, as it will lay the foundations of a new data analysis paradigm that allows to perform assignments of spectral features never done before, therefore providing a major contribution to the advancement of this field.'",0,0

436,73512,No,Effects of consuming fish on iron bioavailability in women with the G277S transferrin gene mutation,"Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common nutritional deficit in either the developed or the developing world, being more prevalent in women of child-bearing age and children. Iron deficiency anaemia can impair work efficiency, cause symptoms of fatigue and malaise and during pregnancy it can result in pre-term labour and low-birth-weight babies. Genetic variants in the iron regulatory systems influence the likelihood of iron deficiency. The G277S transferrin mutation is found to influence iron metabo lism and predispose menstruating white women to iron deficiency anaemia. Apart from the genetic contributor, iron status may reflect the form as well as the amount of iron in the diet. Non-haem iron is subject to a variety of modifying influences that ma y enhance or inhibit iron uptake. Fish contains certain components that enhance non-haem iron absorption. Very little is known about the influence of processed fish on iron bioavailability. The objectives of the present project are: 1.To establish the presence of the G277S mutation in transferrin gene in a group of white menstruating women with low iron stores (ferritin<20 ug/l) and haemoglobin >11g/dl who present a single ethnic background of European ancestry. A new assay will be developed in order to determine the SNP allele variant of G277S. 2.To comparatively study the effect of sous vide fish on non-haem iron absorption from vegetables in a group of women with either the G277S/G277S or G277S/G277G genotype (preferably homozygous) versus a control group that do not present the indicated mutation in the transferrin gene but the wild type G277G/G277G. This part of the study will be done using stable isotope methodology, specifically the erythrocyte incorporation method. These techniques w ill be introduced in the host institute in Madrid.

437,223203,No,Variations in stress responsivity in hens: matching birds to environments,"Because of the high demand for eggs, large numbers of hens are farmed in modern egg production. Because of the intensity of this form of farming, the public has justifiably been concerned about the welfare of these birds. Higher welfare also leads to higher quality eggs, higher productivity, and lower incidence of disease and therefore lower need for antibiotics.  We aim to reduce the chronic stress experienced by hens. To this end, we will investigate the neurobiological, genetic and developmental factors that lead to higher stress resilience, and the environmental (housing) factors that lead to chronic stress. Europe has led the world in hen welfare with the complete ban of battery cages (European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC). However, the replacement housing systems have their own potential welfare challenges. Our goal is to identify these challenges and develop improvements for implementation by industry. We will train a new generation of innovative and entrepreneurial early-stage researchers, able to face different challenges related to poultry farming and to apply scientific knowledge and ideas to products and services for economic and social benefit. To do this, we will constitute an international network of groups with expertise in avian brain research, genetics, welfare and egg farming. The training will be complemented by secondments in different laboratories of the network, workshops, and industrial secondments in the poultry industry. The new generation of professionals will apply this knowledge and experience to improve poultry housing systems, welfare, and product quality, which will grow the sector's resilience in addressing growing societal demands for higher animal welfare and healthier diets. Moreover, they will contribute to strengthen Europe's human capital in R&I, increase Europe's attractiveness as a leading research destination, improve Europe's competitiveness and growth, and engage in an improved knowledge-based economy and society.",0,0
813,221936,No,"An-Iconology: History, Theory, and Practices of Environmental Images","'Recent developments in image-making techniques have resulted in a drastic blurring of the threshold between the world of the image and the real world. Immersive and interactive virtual environments have enabled the production of pictures that elicit in the perceiver a strong feeling of being incorporated in a quasi-real world. In doing so such pictures conceal their mediateness (their being based on a material support), their referentiality (their pointing to an extra-iconic dimension), and their separateness (normally assured by framing devices), paradoxically challenging their status as images, as icons: they are veritable “an-icons”. This kind of pictures undermines the mainstream paradigm of Western image theories, shared by major models such as the doctrine of mimesis, the phenomenological account of image-consciousness, the analytic theories of depiction, the semiotic and iconological methods. These approaches miss the key counter-properties regarding an-icons as 'environmental' images: their immediateness, unframedness, and presentness. Subjects relating to an-icons are no longer visual observers of images; they are experiencers living in a quasi-real environment that allows multisensory affordances and embodied agencies. AN-ICON aims to develop “an-iconology” as a new methodological approach able to address this challenging iconoscape. Such an approach needs to be articulated in a transdisciplinary and transmedial way: 1) HISTORY – a media-archaeological reconstruction will provide a taxonomy of the manifold an-iconic strategies (e.g. illusionistic painting, pre-cinematic dispositifs, 3D films, video games, head mounted displays); 2) THEORY – an experiential account (drawing on phenomenology, visual culture and media studies) will identify the an-iconic key concepts; 3) PRACTICES – a socio-cultural section will explore the multifaceted impact of an-iconic images, environments and technologies on contemporary professional domains as well as on everyday life.

The research programme involves:  optimization of the composite processing  coating of fibres and its influence on their mechanical properties  microstructural and analytical examinations  composite manufacture  testing of the composites  A processing route has been developed for carbon reinforced magnesium matrix composites. The research programme involves the following: optimisation of the composite processing by liquid hot pressing; coating of fibres and its influence on mechanical properties; microstructural studies and microanalytical studies; measurement of mechanical properties; manufacturing and testing of composite sheets.  It has been demonstrated that liquid hot pressing (with moderate pressures of about 15MPa) is a viable and relatively simple process for fabricating carbon reinforced magnesium composites. Rupture strengths of 1400MPa have been obtained in tensile tests on unidirectional composites constituted of AZ61 matrix and M40J carbon fibres (volume fraction: 40%). Young's moduli close to the rule of mixture value has been measured.  Microstructural and microanalytical investigations have revealed the following: a satisfactory infiltration provided the fibres are not too closely packed; no significant interface reaction zone except a slight aluminium enrichment near the fibres; the presence of a thin magnesium oxide layer at the fibre/matrix interface.  A tool has been designed and fabricated in order to manufacture 300 mm x 300 mm x 1.5 mm sheets in industrial conditions.

563,209728,No,Teleost mucosal B1-like lymphocytes at the crossroad of tolerance and immunity,"B cells are one of the main players of immunity, responsible for the production of immunoglobulins (Igs). In 2011, I was granted an ERC Starting grant to undertake the phenotypical and functional characterization of teleost B lymphocytes based on the hypothesis that they do not behave as mammalian B2 cells (conventional B cells) but closely resemble mammalian innate B1 lymphocytes involved in extrafollicular T-independent (TI) responses. Since then, my laboratory has gathered considerable evidences that strengthen this hypothesis. These studies were mostly carried out in central lymphoid compartments, but did not address how teleost B1-like cells regulate the delicate balance between immunity and tolerance at mucosal interfaces, in species lacking follicular structures. In this new project, I want to pursue my studies on B lymphocyte functionality, focusing on how teleost mucosal B cells are regulated, still under the assumption that fish B lymphocytes resemble better a B1 model. We will study how fish B cells differentiate to antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and establish extrafollicular long-term memory, taking into account novel results in mammals that have challenged traditional paradigms and revealed that long-term immunological memory can be established through TI IgM B1-like responses. Furthermore, we will also study the role of IgD in the gills, as previous studies from my group suggest that this Ig plays a key role in the regulation of immunity in this specific mucosa, as it seems to do in humans in areas such as the upper respiratory tract. Addressing how fish B cells mount a protective mucosal immune response in the absence of T cell help from organized follicles could provide new mechanistic insights into IgM and IgD responses emerging in humans. From a practical view, our work will contribute to understand why satisfactory mucosal vaccination is still an unreached goal for most diseases in both mammals and fish, despite their strong demand.",0,0
214,227337,Yes,Revealing mechanisms of plant-soil feedback in search of trait indicators,"It is increasingly recognized that plant-soil feedbacks influence the composition and functioning of natural communities and ecosystems. However, our capacity to predict the outcome of such above-belowground interactions is still hampered by poor generalization capacity. As plant traits have been used to explain patterns in both plant and soil communities, they could provide a useful approach for explaining and predicting plant-soil feedback. Here, I will use the recent advances made in plant trait research, which have greatly increased our capacity to predict the responses of natural plant communities to environmental changes, to improve our mechanistic understanding of the factors underlying plant-soil feedback strength and sign (negative, neutral and positive) under changing environmental conditions. Based on the growth versus defence trade-off hypothesis, fast-growing plant species with acquisitive traits build up negative feedback, whereas slow-growing species with conservative traits develop positive feedback with their own soil biota. The growth-defence framework is widely based on leaf spectrum economy, and it is unknown how well predictive aboveground traits are for growth strategies of plant roots belowground. With my proposed project PLECTRA, I aim to investigate how well the sign and strength of plant-soil feedback can be predicted from aboveground and belowground plant traits. This knowledge will improve our understanding of the role that plant-soil feedback plays in structuring plant communities and will, among others, be helpful to enhance restoration success of degraded ecosystems and improve management of invasive species.",1,1

245,106378,No,Human monoclonal antibody therapy to prevent hepatitis C virus reinfection of liver transplants: advancing lead monoclonal antibodies into clinical trial,"Worldwide, 200 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). An estimated 15 million individuals are living with HCV infection within the EU. The economic, health and societal costs of chronic HCV infection are significant. HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and the leading indication for liver transplantation. The only treatment for end-stage liver disease is a liver transplant, yet the transplanted liver becomes rapidly re-infected and is frequently destroyed within 5 years after transplantation.  In this cohort of patients current antiviral treatments are too toxic - there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective treatments for use in this setting. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target virus entry, are as yet an underutilised and potentially highly effective and safe weapon in the armoury against HCV infection. The consortium has identified MAb leads which, in pre-clinical analyses, potently block HCV infection.  HCV exhibits a high degree of genetic and antigenic variability, which enables the virus to escape protective immune responses. Crucially, the lead antibodies identified by the consortium are capable of preventing infection by a wide range of genetically distinct isolates because they target highly conserved epitopes on the virus or host receptor molecules. This limits the chances of virus resistance.

746,73042,No,Beetle comparative Genomics and Speciation (BUGS): Genomic tools for the analysis of chromosome changes in the evolution of Coleoptera,"The success of the Genome Projects carried out on a handful of model organisms has anticipated the extreme value of genomic comparative analyses as a way to unveil many functions and properties of these genomes. These analyses, anchored on an evolutionary framework, have the potential to explain the value of observed genomic differences in phenotype changes, with implications in research areas from biodiversity and speciation to health issues. However, given the unfeasibility to accomplish full genome studies in most or a good representation of life forms, alternative short-cut strategies have to be devised to grant access to genomic information of a wide variety of organisms and to assess the impact of their differences.  In this project, we propose the combined use of a PCR-based approach and Molecular Cytogenetics techniques (including FISH, M-FISH and Zoo-FISH), coupled with the ability to isolate specific chromosomes using laser micro-dissection techniques, to generate high-resolution physical chromosome maps of selected organisms using genetic landmarks provided by cDNA libraries. These physical maps will be analysed comparatively to trace genomic structural changes over evolutionary periods. We will implement this methodology in the study of speciation and diversification processes in leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) focusing in the analysis of the genomic changes affecting chromosome structure at three different levels: - role and constraints of hybridisation as a mechanism for speciation, - chromosomal changes accompanying a species radiation, and, - analysis of chromosome synteny in phytophagous Coleoptera.",0,0
435,103533,No,Gut Symbiomes of Fungus-growing Ants,"'Symbiosis is the close and long-term interaction between different biological species. Insects are among the best model systems for studying symbioses as their immune systems appear to be relatively tolerant to invasion and their niches are often so specialized that microbial symbionts can satisfy important metabolic needs. Laboratories across the world often specialize either in the molecular biology of host-symbiont interactions in specific insect models, or in the evolutionary biology of parasitic or mutualistic symbioses taking a broader approach. This proposal is meant to build bridges between these domains, by applying advanced molecular methods to resolve fundamental evolutionary questions of symbiosis in a social insect model system. My research will focus on an almost completely unknown component of the symbiosis between attine ants and their fungus-gardens: the bacterial communities in the guts of these ants that likely fulfill complementary roles in the symbiosis. Objectives are to identify these bacteria, to localize them when they are tissue-specific, and to compare their functional roles across several attine genera that represent different stages of advancement of the symbiosis. I will use qPCR, FISH and TEM to identify putative symbionts, metatranscriptomic techniques to characterize the cumulative bacterial genes that are expressed in the ant guts, and qRT-PCR and RNAi to clarify some of the functional roles of ant and microbial genes that are expressed in the guts. The research that I propose is highly multi-disciplinary, as it combines a wide range of state-of-the-art molecular techniques with conceptual hypotheses from social evolution theory. This combination is feasible because my training in molecular microbiology of fruit-fly and aphid symbionts is combined with the renowned expertise of my host in the evolutionary biology of attine fungus-growing ants. The work proposed will be facilitated by annotated genomes of these ants being available.'",0,0

The Consortium includes catalyst organisations with maturity in e-Business and the necessary organizational structure to co-operate with SME associations, to prove the added-value benefits and viability of CEBOS marketplaces.  OBJECTIVES The main objective of CEBOS is the establishment and evaluation of e-Market Places (Mediation Sites) that will progressively minimize the gap between SMEs and the International on line market. Through the project, CEBOS partners aim at:- Analysing European regional markets in order to identify business opportunities for on line SMEs and depict the business environment where CEBOS BPPs will operate- Analysing SME business models in order to identify their strategic business objectives and their requirements for cost efficient and effective e-Business activities? Delivering Best Practice Models for Electronic Market Places in regional and European level, through their demonstration with active participation of e-Business Catalysts, SME Associations and SMEs - Operating and validating the value added benefits of CEBOS mediator platform for cost efficient and supportive e-Business ? Measuring the impact of such a customized model in regional SME markets and identifying transition and re-engineering requirements - Widely disseminating the CEBOS Business Cases in order to provide SMEs with a strategic competitive advantage in the digital economy. CEBOS will provide a self sustained electronic Market Place remotely administrated by its SME users. A light CEBOS tool that will facilitate remote site & product management by individual users will be also validated during the project in order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage and facilitate its market penetration. The tool will be able to visualize the ASP model locally in order to provide SMEs with a comprehensive view of their catalogue and process model and enhance internal e-Business maturity. The CEBOS sites will also provide the necessary mechanisms for online training of corporate and individual users in order to position themselves more efficiently.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The rationale of the proposed work structure follows to a certain extent a hybrid methodology combining technology and business development activities. As a Best Practice project, the CEBOS consortium strongly believes that a large part of the work should address the alignment of the project technology evolutions with detailed user requirements where SME strategic business objectives are met in a cost efficient way. However, e-Business projects, especially those that deal with electronic market places, should also address organizational transformation, co-operation and business planning issues in order for an SME effectively step and exploit the desired state. To this end our methodology, involves the requirements elicitation and gathering both from user associations, end-users (SMEs), domain experts, and regional surveys on particular aspects of marketing, sales and replenishment processes and regional e-Business status (work package 1). To this end, a mock up demo of CEBOS operation will be presented to the user associations and specifically to a selected set of their members, during focused working seminars, in order to validate the technology choices and demonstrate the preliminary functionality of the overall e-Business platform. Then, follows the specification and planning of the Best Practice pilot operation, where user requirements are transformed into viable business scenarios, along with the specification of open inter-organizational business processes, standard information flows and tele-working practices (work package 2). Then follows the actual deployment phase where all user application scenarios are validated and refined (work package 3). The initial steps for the deployment of the results, such as demonstrations and information dissemination, are already planned to take place during the project lifetime (work package 4). However, the consortium is conscious that the exploitation of a Best Practice project must cope with a number of constraints such a s finance, legislation, marketing, logistics and distribution, in order to be successfully exploited by the majority of SMEs in the respective regions (and European wide). To this end best practice guides will be developed and disseminated to the wider SME community and European / regional decision makers. These guides will clearly present the CEBOS business case and indicate all required transformation and culture building activities on behalf of the SMEs, user associations and regional authorities.

109,220126,Yes,Exploring the dynamics and causes of prehistoric land use change in the cradle of European farming,"European societies today face unprecedented environmental change. Understanding how human societies responded to past challenges of environmental change relates to the interface between culture and environment. The EXPLO project proposes a novel interdisciplinary approach to investigate key questions regarding the interaction between past human ways of life, land use and the wider environment through a unique combination of archaeological, biological and dynamic mathematical modelling approaches.  Archaeological prehistoric sites in lakes of northern Greece and the southern Balkans provide an excellent opportunity to investigate rich archives of societal and environmental change in the cradle of European farming. Natural lake sediments and submerged prehistoric settlements offer exceptional preservation conditions and uniquely holistic insights into past anthroposphere, biosphere and geosphere dynamics. More than 8,000 years ago, technological and social breakthroughs allowed the introduction of farming from western Asia to Greece and thus for the first time to Europe; however, so far there is no high-resolution picture of how this revolutionary innovation interacted with the environment, including its long-term consequences.   New underwater archaeological research will allow the construction of highly precise settlement chronologies on the basis of dendrochronology, radiocarbon dating and Bayesian modelling. On-site information from excavations will be combined with off-site palaeoenvironmental data from the same lakes to investigate past adaptation strategies to the environment as well as the effects of past societies on their environments. Dynamic models integrating archaeological contexts and palaeoenvironmental data will open up the opportunity to investigate vulnerability, resilience, tipping points and thresholds of ancient agrarian economies, with implications for future food systems under a rapidly changing climate.",1,1

Recently, Xf was introduced into Italy, where it is causing severe damage to olive crops, and in France, where so far it is limited to ornamental plants and some landscape trees. The overall goal of the research program is to assess Xf potential to spread throughout EU territory, while maximizing its impact through a multifactor approach, based on a seamless integration amongst the 29 partners involved. Proposed actions will be complementary to those carried out under the Project POnTE - 635646, thus ensuring an unbroken continuity with currently ongoing efforts. Specific objectives have been outlined following a step-by-step route, from preventing its introduction into pest-free areas to the establishment of successful eradication strategies in infected zones. Preventive measures against Xf will be strengthened by implementing EU certification programs and developing a plan for establishing a EU Clean Plant Network. EU policy makers will be supported through the development of pest risk assessment tools, focused on current outbreaks and forecasting potentially threatened regions. Surveillance will be properly implemented, supporting the development of early detection tools for field use, remote sensing technology and predictive modelling. Critical information on the pathogen biology, epidemiological traits and hosts under threat, will be gathered with the guidance of the American research groups with long-established research. At the same time, the insect-bacteria interactions will be determined, for developing strategic control measures. The final overall objective is a comprehensive integrated management strategy for diseases associated with Xf, applicable both IPM and organic farming systems, to prevent Xf spread, control its economic, environmental/social impact, when an outbreak would occur.",1,0

526,13509,No,STUDY OF RADIOBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AT LOW DOSES,"Description of research work  The research programme is a continuation of one which expired in 1989, and aims to provide information to enlarge our knowledge and understanding of the biological action of radiation, and so to tackle specialized problems relevant in the context of radiological protection. The general aims of the work carried out in this contract are the study of the dose-effect relationship at low radiation doses; the interaction mechanisms and the influence of dose rate and radiation quality and the important biological parameters for well identified endpoints in vivo and in vitro.  Studies of dose response relationships for radiation carcinogenesis after single and fractionated neutron doses were performed. This involved over 2000 female BC3F1 mice irradiated with 2 different radiation qualities. The study focussed on tumour incidence (age adjusted), life span shortening, and time to tumour appearance. Mortality rates for specific causes of death indicated that the risk of death with ovarian tumours was appreciably increased below 0.1 Gy for both neutrons and X-rays. For other solid tumours the minimum doses producing a significant increase of the risk were 8 Gy respectively.  A parallel analysis of lymphoma and myeloid leukaemia incidence data in about 3000 BC3F1 male mice irradiated with single acute doses of X-rays and fussion neutrons was performed. For malignant lymphoma the data the data was well described and values are in agreement with those expected from the haematopoetic cell survival. This agrees with the hypothesis that such cells are responsible for the lymphomas. In irradiated BC3F1 mice myeloid leukaemia is a more rare event, nevertheless the dose response curves are very similar in shape to those reported for CBA/H and RF/Un mice.  Research also showed that liver tumour can be induced in mice with very different spontaneous incidences (ie CBA/Cne 67%, BC3F1 11%). Based on these findings the influence of radiation quality (ie X-rays and fission neutrons) on the induction of such tumours in BC3F1 mice was investigated. For both radiation qualities the final incidence appeared to increase with the dose in a wide dose range.  Studies of in vivo and in vitro transformation per surving cell were performed. The mechanisms of tumour induction at the cellular level were studied in order to obtain an estimation of the risk of neoplastic transformation per cell in vivo. The risk was estimated for both dysplastic lesions and tumours.  The transplantation technique used for studies of harderian gland tumours was applied to the in v ivo study of hepatocyte survival and the risk of neoplastic transformation per surviving cell in the mouse. The data for CBA/Cne mice was consistent with a linear quadratic dose effect relationship while for BC3F1 mice a simple quadratic expression provided a better fit to the experimental points.  Further experimental work was performed to compare the transforming effectiveness of equal doses delivered to C3H10T1/2 cells following either acute or fractionated irradiation protocols. Results confirmed that the neutron dose fractionation does not significantly influence survival compared to acute irradiation.  Late somatic effects of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) were investigated in BC3F1 mice using a fractionated protocol. In particular, using a mouse population with a high natural lymphoma incidence it was intended to investigate whether the expected depression of this tumour following irradiation was associated with other tumour types or shortening of the life span. Results indicate the presence of a relevant incidence of skin cancers which appeared to be the most likely cause of life shortening of the treated mice together with kidney degenerative disease.  Based on previous finding with liver tumours the influence of radiation quality and age at irradiation on the induction of such tumours were investigated in BC3F1 male mice. A marked age dependence was demonstrated for radiation induced liver cancer tumours with a higher susceptibility in young than in old mice. Age dependence also appears to affect neutron relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relative to X-rays for the induction of liver neoplasms. The RBE value for prenatal irradiation is about 2 times higher than for young adult animals irradiated at comparable low doses.  The obtain experimental evidence on the influence of exposure prolongation on the effectiveness of low neutron doses, an in vivo study of the carcinogenic effect of fractionated doses of fission neutrons and of X-rays was ca rried out. About 2000 BC3F1 male mice were given each 5 equal daily dose fractions corresponding to cumulating doses of 2.5 cGy to 70 cGy for fission neutrons and of 25 cGy to 300 cGy for X-rays. Irradiated and control animals were followed up for their life span. After spontaneous death a complete necropsy was performed. Experimental data are being analyzed with respect to life span shortening and the induction of selected tumour types which include lymphoma and myeloid leukaemia.  In vitro studies of neoplastic transformation induced by radiation and chemicals are frequently carried out using different cell lines. The C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast system is a very useful tool for these studies as it allows a close quantitative determination of the dose effect relationships for this end point. The system has yielded interesting information on the effect of radiation dose rate. Some experiment with neutrons have indicated the possibility of an enhanced transforming potential of fractionated doses or low dose rates in the dose range of 0 to 1 Gy in comparison to single acute exposures. A series of experiments using this system have been initiated. This purpose responds to the main objective of radiation protection, that is to achieve and maintain appropriate safe conditions for justified activities involving human exposure. Such a goal rests on the possibility of establishing unambiguous correlations between the physical quantities characterizing the irradiation and the susceptibility of biological tissues and organs to biological effects of major severity.   In this context, it is widely recognized that animal studies are a very important tool concerning the study of the biological consequences of exposure to radiation and, in particular, the mechanisms of radiation induced carcinogenesis. They often represent the only reliable source of information relating to the important aspects of the biological response to radiation in vivo, for example the shape of the dose-effect relationship at low doses, the influence of radiation quality and the time modalities of the dose administration. Recent studies have indicated a concordance of relative risk estimates for the induction of some cancer types between humans and mice, suggesting that extrapolation between species can be considered, and have encouraged further studies in this direction.   Fast neutrons represent a particularly important problem, as, in the present situation, no useful estimate of RBE can be obtained from available human data of cancer mortality. Furthermore, they pose special important questions, some of which may have far reaching radiation protection implications. Among these, the variation in carcinogenic and mutagenic effectiveness consequent to a protraction of exposure deserves particular attention. Differences in RBE for tumour induction in various organs and tissues also call for careful consideration.   The present programme uses low doses of different radiation qualities and various modes of irradiation on different experimental model systems for suitable endpoints, including life shortening and tumour induction in experimental animals. In particular, in order to obtain further evidence on the enhanced effectiveness of prolongated low neutron dose exposures (low dose rate or fractionation), the present activity includes, as a substantial part, an experimental in vivo study of the carcinogenic effect of fractionate doses of fission neutrons and, for comparison, also of X-rays on long-living BC3F1 male mice.",0,0
610,46712,No,Tap - a gene involved in neuronal differentiation,"Research objectives and content The aim of my project is to understand the role of the tap gene in the control of neuronal connectivity in Drosophila. tap encodes a transcriptional factor with a bHLH motif which is expressed at a late stage in one of the neurons that innervate each gustatory organ. As these organs are functionally different, I believe that tap is responsible for the neuronal properties of the neuron in which it is expressed. To determine the developmental function of tap, I plan to identify loss- and gain-of-function tapmutants, and to analyse their phenotypes. This will be done by using genetic (Gal4-UAS system, FRT-FLP system, transgenic lines) as well as molecular techniques (DNA constructs) combined with DiI labelling of neurons and behavioural tests. I think that a better understanding of how tap acts will help us to understand how neuronal specificity is genetically controlled.

SUN bioscience SA, a spin-off company of EPFL in Switzerland, was founded in 2016 with the ambition to move these organoid cultures from basic research to the Health Care industry.   To reach this goal, SUN bioscience has developed Gri3D, a microstructured biocompatible hydrogel platform, and aims to establish this technology as a new standard for growing organoids at industrial scale and precision. Gri3D prototypes have been field tested with over 30 European academic and pharmaceutical R&D groups. In addition, SUN bioscience has developed an industrial automated manufacturing mechanism for Gri3D that is now being translated into the world-wide first machine, Hydra I, that auomates liquid handling with hydrogel microembossing.  The objective of this feasibility study is to verify the technical, economical and practical viability of Gri3D and to ensure its successful market entry in Europe. Specifically, the first step is to validate the production capacity of Hydra I by producing 1’000 Gri3D units, which corresponds to one tenth of the total annual target production volume. In a second step, SUN bioscience aims to validate the market by commercializing these 1’000 Gri3D units to existing customers and to expand its customer base to a total of 20-40 recurrent clients.  According to our current strategy, SUN bioscience will run at maximum single line production capacity with cumulative revenues of >€2M within 3 years after market introduction of Gri3D. The 3D technologies market is expected to reach €600M by 2021.

First, we will study how different LLL policies are compatible with each other in terms of their orientations and objectives and how each policy considers the needs of ‘young adults’. Second, we will research the intended and unintended effects of policies on young adults. In this regard, we will look into relevant social developments such as life course de-standardisation processes and into an emerging new political economy of skills. Third, we will generate new knowledge about regional and local policymaking, with particular attention to actors, dynamics, and trends. By focusing on their regional/local context, we will elucidate the interaction and complementarity of LLL policies with other sectors of society, thus contributing to a better understanding of current fragmentation and discrepancies, in order to set parameters for future decision-making support systems.  The project will first contribute new knowledge of the impact of LLL policies on young adults’ life courses, yielding insights on the conditions, strategies, and necessities for policies to become effective. In addition, it will provide insights on the innovations and potentials they unlock, in particular with view to informal and non-formal learning to better address vulnerable groups.

The localized generation of electrical fields at extremely small scales has the potential to revolutionize conventional methods of electrically stimulating cells.  The objective of this proposal is the development of miniaturized untethered devices capable of delivering electric currents to cells for the stimulation of their vital functions. To this end, we propose the construction of micro- and nanoscale magnetoelectric structures that can be triggered using external magnetic fields.  These small devices will consist of composite hybrid structures containing piezoelectric and magnetostrictive layers. By applying an oscillating magnetic field in the presence of a DC bias field, the magnetostrictive element will deform, thereby generating stress in a piezoelectric shell, which in turn will become electrically polarized. Small devices capable of wirelessly generating electric fields offer an innovative way of studying the electrical and electrochemical stimulation of cells.  For example, by concentrating electric fields at specific locations in a cell, the behavior of protein membrane components such as cell adhesion molecules or transport proteins can be altered to modulate the stiction of proliferating cells or ion channel gating kinetics.'",0,0

Therefore ERITASK will be established at University College Cork (UCC) to bring individuals with appropriate complementary research backgrounds together to achieve this aim. Whilst facilities for the analysis of chemical compounds are available and the toxic effects of chemicals deposited in soils are studied, no expertise to make atmospheric field measurements or associated source apportionment modelling exists. Moreover no experience to perfo rm in vitro studies assessing the toxic effects of fine particles on human pulmonary epithelial cell and macrophage cultures is available. Therefore four expert postdoctoral researchers with skills not available at UCC are assessed to be necessary in order to ensure success for this ToK activity. The expertises required are divided as follows: (i) Field measurement of particulate matter; (ii) 'Total' chemical analysis of the particulate matter; (iii) Source apportionment modelling; (iv) Biochemical toxicolo gy of air particulate components. A successful outcome to the spectrum of research objectives given for ERITASK will require the researchers to build on their own skill-bases, to develop expertise in new techniques (in order to suitably communicate on the wide-ranging scientific aspects of the project) and then to act upon salient features from all areas. A Ph.D. student will be assigned to each of the four areas in order to",1,1
129,2711,Yes,Subsoil microbiology,"The objective is to obtain quantitative information on the microbial activity in the subsoil which will aid in evaluating the ecological risks and the economic and social benefits of pesticide use.  Field stations were built in 3 countries and equipped with weather stations in order to investigate the risks of chemicals to groundwater purity and subsoil microbiology. Soil air and temperature sampling probes were developed and installed at each station and subsoil temperatures and oxygen partial pressures were monitored. The highest variations in temperatures, oxygen concentrations and carbon dioxide concentrations were in the upper 1 m of soil. Below 2 m and down to 8 m, temperatures at all 3 sites were high enough to allow microbial activity throughout the year. The oxygen content in all layers of the unsaturated zones was high enough to allow year round microbial activity. Soil cores were collected down the profiles at each station. The distribution, composition and activity levels of the microflora in the top soil and in the unsaturated zones of the 3 profiles were investigated. Aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms were found at all depths. In general, the numbers of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased with depth. However, at 2 different sampling sites on the silt loam, bacterial numbers decreased to down to a depth of 3.5 m, and then significantly increased. The microbial biomass of this soil followed a similar pattern. In the other soils, the microbial biomass decreased with increasing depth. With one exception, fungi were not found at any of the sites below 2.5 m. The microflora of the 3 unsaturated zones could readily mineralize various forms of nitrogen, and radiolabelled substrates. They could also degrade and mineralize carbonyl-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and ring labelled 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. In subsoil samples from all 3 sites, there was evidence for adaptation and growth of the microflora on 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. Using data from adsorption isotherm and degradation studies, attempts were made at modelling carbofuran degradation in the different layers of the profiles. In Germany, France and the United Kingdom, field stations, one per country, will be built over aquifers, on frequently occurring agricultural soils, to allow fluxes in prevailing conditions at different depths in the subsoil to be monitored (ie temperature, water potential and the oxygen content of the soil atmosphere). Both classical and new methods will be used to characterize the microflora in homogenized soil samples prepared from cores in 25 cm or 50 cm steps down to the water table. Methods to be used include: colony counts of aerobic bacteria, streptomyces and fungi by plate dilution; counting of anaerobic microorganisms after incubation in chambers depleted of oxygen; counting in soil smears; and analysis of the fungal colonization quotient of soil particles down the soil profile with a soil wash technique. The rate of degradation of naturally occurring carbon and nitrogenous compounds will also be measured.   For comparative purposes, degradation studies with one natural substrate and one radiolabelled pesticide (2,4-D) will be conducted under standardized laboratory conditions. In further tests, degradation of these compounds will also be followed using conditions which simulate those in the individual fields from which the subsoils were collected. These tests will, if possible, also be conducted with a second radiolabelled pesticide (carbofuran and/or atrazine). In addition, the side effects of several chemicals after in situ labelling of the subsoil microflora will be tested.",1,1
512,102716,No,Dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity,"'Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is an approach toward the background-independent quantization of the gravitational field. It is an exciting research area with many recent breakthroughs. LQG predicts the discreteness of the quantum geometry at the Planck scale, thus provides us new understandings of the spacetime structure in the fundamental physics.  The dynamical properties of LQG plays a crucial role in the framework of LQG. However there are many key issues in the dynamics of LQG, which have not been clarified yet, including the low-energy effective theory, the continuum limit, and the relation between different formulations. In the project proposed here, my main objective is to clarify the key issues in the LQG dynamics, and develop the theory of LQG toward a complete formulation that could be empirically tested.  The present project is based on a well-established results and techniques. The investigation will be carried out with a systematic programme. In the proposal, a detailed work plan is presented to describe the research programme toward the objective of the project.  The project proposed here will be hosted by the Centre de Physique Theorique (CPT) in Marseille. Prof. Carlo Rovelli will be the supervisor of this project. The project will be carried out mainly by the independent research, with the support from the supervisor and scientific collaborators.

With its capacity of on-line and real-time measurement of pollutants, measurement techniques that are not available at the moment, the proposed sensor is a valuable tool for landfill monitoring, risk assessment and control of remediation efficiency. It can, for example, improve the 'use' of natural attenuation as a remediation technique. Natural attenuation, i. e. leaving remediation to natural processes without applying costly techniques, is based on the observation that there is a decrease in the contaminant concentrations that limits the extent of the contaminant plume. The key disadvantage of natural attenuation is the need to ensure that the contamination does not propagate further. The proposed sensors, placed in the vicinity of the plume may serve as a cost effective and reliable alert network. Possible emerging economic possibilities for waste disposal should strengthen EU industrial competivity. This is of special importance for the EU with its densely populated production sites. Scientific objectives and approach The project aims at monitoring of soil and water for landfill related contamination by an in site monitoring for soil and water by infrared sensing. A portable and rugged system will be developed that will allow sensor elements to be inserted and left in soil locations under the ground for long term monitoring of organic pollutants. The concept of a buried sensor gives the opportunity to continuously monitor organic pollutants without sampling errors. Since it is important to monitor pollutants over a long period of time, the sensor system will be optimised with regard to long-term stability. Expected impacts The IMSIS sensor concept is novel for landfill monitoring, its central objective is to open new possibilities for continuous monitoring and control. For this reasons it is one objective of the project to investigate and evaluate the need of end users with respect to sensor applications. Mid IR spectroscopic measurements are widely used for the analysis of samples placed inside spectrometers. This project is involved in the development and use of IR optical fibres for absorption measurements on remote locations. The development of this remote spectroscopy is on one hand an innovation with respect to real time analytical measurements inside landfills, on the other hand it opens the field of all kind of IR remote sensing applications e.g. in process control or measurements in explosion endangered environments. Within the project, there will be a development of short segments of tapered and flattened fibres that will serve as sensor elements in the sensor head. Tapering of fibres to increase sensitivity is a well-known technique in the UV and visible wavelength range. Tapering of MIR fibres is a completely new and demanding task since IR transmitting materials are difficult to process. A further improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by replacing tapered fibres by planar MIR wave-guides with a thickness of a few µm.

267,83739,No,"Atomic structure, selectivity and nanostructuring of biomolecules on silicon carbide surfaces","Major objective of this proposal is a detailed structural characterization of biomolecular adsorbates on silicon carbide surfaces. By combining scanning tunnelling microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, an atomic level understanding of the role of nanochemistry and nanostructure are possible to achieve.  This will allow detailed electronic and chemical characterizations of the surface/interface properties of selected biomolecules/SiC systems and also be utilized for characterization of surface structures and nanostructure evolution that are of fundamental interest as well as of importance for device applications. The feasibility of the project is ensured by the expertise of the host institution (MPI, Stuttgart) that has successfully applied this approach to the growth of biomolecular layers before, and by the familiarity of the applicant and host with SiC surface analysis and preparation.

941,27125,No,Combined atmosphere amazon region experiment: use of integrated modelling for experiment design,"This proposal addresses a concerted contribution of a number of European reseach institutions to the design of a land-surface-atmosphere interaction, mesoscale field experiment in the Amazon region, called CABARE (Combined Atmosphere-Biosphere, Amazon Region Experiment).  A network of European institutions has been built during the last 3 years with support of the CEC-EPOCH/ENVIRONMENT programmes to provide a major input into the ECHIVAL/EFEDA experiment in Spain and HAPEX-Sahel experiment in 1992 in Niger.  These experiments were a major-European contribution to the glabal change programmes in the framework of WCRP and IGBP activities.  It is anticipated from WCRP/IGBP side that the European research consortium would contribute to the CABARE experiment, being one of the major activities of the research into the global change processes and impacts for the near future.  Design of the large scale field experiment is addressed in a novel way. Proposal aims to provide guidance to the design and implementation of CABARE- main experiment (to be executed in 1996-1998) on the basis of full integration of existing data from the region with a nested modeling approach.  The strategy involves the use of mesoscale models with different resolutions (participants 01 and 03); calibration and sensitivity analysis of SVAT-models (01 and 02), continuation of an existing climate and soil moisture monitoring network in the region (02) and the analysis of available satellite and airborne data (04).  The insight gained from this analysis will contribute substantially to the understanding of the main processes controlling the exchange of energy, water and momentum in the Amazon basin.  This has direct consequences for spatial and temporal resolution of individual measurements to be carried out in the main experiment, like ground fluxes, soil moisture monitoring, boundary layer sounding, airborne measurements and selection of satellite data to be acquired. It will also allow for more efficient use of available resources in terms of instrumentation and personnel during the main experiment. The four institutions proposing this project will have a backbone role in putting together a programme for European contribution to the main phase of CABARE.  A European workshop will be organized aimed at making an inventory of the potential contributions and a scientific experimental plan will be elaborated for the coordinated European input.",1,0
840,195584,No,MASS POLITICAL LIFE WRITING,"'Self-narration is extraordinarily common in contemporary culture. The practice constitutes an extremely popular literary genre, is widespread on the internet in the form of diaries updated daily by huge numbers of web users, and is used in organisational training and as a tool in personal therapy education. Employing an interdisciplinary approach – drawing on social history, sociology, semiotics and textual analysis – my research project will examine one of the 'archaeological' elements underpinning this success: the mass political use of the autobiographical form, first by communism and subsequently by feminism after the Second World War, with a focus on the Italian experience. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) was the largest communist party in the Western world, and Italy’s experience of feminism is one of the most significant on the European continent. Both movements made intense political use of the autobiographical form. The Italian communists inherited the activist autobiographical framework characteristic of the Bolshevik experience. Self-narration was a prerequisite to joining the PCI until the second half of the fifties; however, this organisational practice became obsolete over the course of the sixties. The link between autobiographical accounts and political activism was subsequently revived by feminism in the seventies, in the context of consciousness raising groups. The main objectives of the project are the following:  A) to analyse the mass political use of the autobiographical account in Italy since the Second World War;  B) to use this analysis to produce an innovative interpretation of the actual success of self-narration. They will be fulfilled through research in the archives of the PCI and the Italian feminist movement. I will use Italian historical events as a case study to highlight the obscure political origins of a specific activity – self-narration – that unites various contemporary national cultures of Europe in a transnational manner.

701,88292,No,"Wide-Band, Self-Calibrating, CMOS-Integrated HALL Magnetometer for Current Sensing Applications","Electronic systems for smart power control are being increasingly installed in modern electrically-propelled vehicles, motors, and actuators for precise: a) position and motion adjustment, b) force and torque regulation, c) power efficiency optimization, and d) energy saving. The functionality of such controllers relies primarily on electric current sensors capable of monitoring precisely pulsed currents varying from DC up to frequencies as high as 100kHz and of reading current alteration rates as high as 10GA/sec. This requirement sets the sensor bandwidth specification to at least 1MHz for 5kA maximum current amplitude and resolution of 0.02% that is 1A. Additionally, modern power control applications require sending of current in multiple conductors positioned densely among each other. The aforementioned restriction poses limitations concerning sensor dimensions and cost as well as positioning distance between sensor and current conductors. Temperature stability is another important parameter that severely affects the performance of current sensors, especially in the case of industrial applications, where they are subjected to large temperature variations. The IHACS project aims at the development of a new family of very compact, galvanically isolated, open-loop, wide-band, self-calibrating current sensors. The sensors are based on sophisticated multi-axes CMOS HALL magnetometers with no ferromagnetic parts that employ a new, elaborate technique for sensitivity stabilization against temperature effects.",0,0
582,32218,No,THE PUBLIC DATAWEB,"The aim of PDWeb is to exploit knowledge and experience already gained in operating an embryonic public information system. The project will use multimedia techniques to provide employment information, with an existing kiosk network and updating and control mechanisms. Agency requirements in employment and related areas will then be developed into an expanded system. The first phase will entail validation of results backed by user statistics from the kiosks, with emphasis on a general-purpose design. The second will lead towards exploitation in which urban and rural areas offer their citizens free easy-to-operate new services.  The purpose of this project is to use and expand upon the knowledge and experience gained by operating an embryonic public information system. This service will use multimedia techniques and provides employment information. An existing kiosk network and methods with software to update and control it have already been developed. In this manner risk to the project is considerably reduced.  The project will develop user needs in employment and other related areas to offer a much wider public service. The first phase will have great emphasis upon validation of results including user statistics obtained from the kiosks themselves. PDWeb supports as far as practical a 'design for all' approach.  The second phase introduces more commercial aspects leading to exploitation.  The PDWeb will be set up primarily in Calderdale upon a public kiosk demonstrator, then at our partners' locations as knowledge and sponsorship is gained. (PDWeb may expand to WWW also.) The outcome will result in several EU Urban and Rural areas having new services. Local citizens will have even handed and free access to a range of simple to operate information services. The model so created may be duplicated throughout the EU.

The goal is to identify institutional and societal constructs that are frequently left out of decision-making for marine protected area design and management.  Research conclusions will be based on comparison of spatial outcomes.  The researcher will synthesize approaches that have addressed the challenges of working in a multi-faceted, high-use marine environment in which there are varying levels of information, challenges of cooperation between local and regional managers, scientists and users and difficulty soliciting the input of relevant stakeholders.  Major phases of the research are: 1) development of a typology of the designation of terrestrial reserves in Israel and marine reserves in the territorial waters of countries along the Mediterranean Sea; 2) review and application of appropriate decision support tools that can address at least two identified challenges in the Israeli context: connectivity of reserves and stakeholder participation; and 3) comparison of outcomes from the use of decision support tools chosen based on the country context needs and actual reserve design and management plans proposed by the nature protection authorities in Israel.  This research can inform regulators, policymakers and conservationists about what various theoretical views and values mean when applied to conditions in the field (both in terms of physical resources and institutional constructs) and how and to what extent real-world outcomes engender preferred practices based on ecosystem based management and integrated coastal zone management for marine reserves in a network context.",1,0
958,83680,No,Mammalian regulation of iron circulation,"Iron is an essential mineral. Both excess and lack of iron are detrimental to life-function. In mammals highest iron use is in the red blood cell (RBC), and iron from senescent RBCs is recycled for erythropoiesis through the macrophage (MP). Understanding the regulation of systemic iron recycling has made progress through the detection of hepcidin that regulates iron release from MPs and intestinal iron import.  Cellular iron metabolism is regulated in mammals mainly post-transcriptionally by the two iron regulatory proteins (IRPs). IRPs sense cellular iron status and regulate proteins of iron metabolism by binding to an RNA stem loop structure when cells are iron deplete. In mice with targeted deletions of IRP2 misregulation of proteins involved in iron metabolism, including ferritin, leads to improper iron distribution, anaemia, high serum ferritin and late onset neurodegeneration.  Our preliminary finding that ferritin in bone marrow resident MPs of IRP2-/- mice is low, while ferritin content in bone marrow de rived MPs cultured from IRP2-/- mice is high suggests that ferritin is secreted from MPs by a systemically regulated pathway that is disrupted in IRP2-/- mice. This implies a tight link between cellular and systemic regulation of iron metabolism. My lab will focus on two very different aspects of systemic iron distribution and effects of its disruption.  One project will characterize the mechanism of ferritin trafficking in wild type and IRP2-/- mice. We will explore the possibility that secreted ferritin is involved in cell to cell iron distribution and that ferritin plays an active role in the neuropathology of the IRP2-/- mice and in other neurodegenerative diseases where homeostasis of brain iron distribution is disrupted such as Parkinson's disease.  The second project will characterize the immunologic response of MPs to erythrophagocytosis and will explore the effect of the MP state after this daily event on immune homeostasis and iron recycling.",0,0

NanoOnSpect has 3 development aims: 1) Newly-developed online characterisation techniques will be combined in a 'one-box' characterisation unit. This will be able to determine dispersion, particle size, particle network formation and resulting composite properties online under demanding industrial conditions, with a (factor 2 to 10) higher resolution than conventional online characterisation tools. 2) An Artificial Neural Network and Expert System (ES) module will be developed to analyse sensor signals, predict the complex quality of the PNC and calculate new input parameters for the compounding line. 3) A breakthrough concept will be developed to adapt the mixing process during composite production, based on feedback from the ES.  The characterisation tool and process control technique will allow precise adjustment of the composite properties (e.g. dispersion-dependent properties) during production. This will improve product quality, allow the reliable production of PNCs with tailored functions and reduce waste production. The technology will be validated in existing production lines for two particle types. NanoOnSpect will also deliver in depth understanding of materials and processing, shortening material development cycles and formulation changeovers.  The NanoOnSpect consortium, consisting of 8 SMEs, 2 RTD performers and 2 associations, combines competences in measurement technology/automation, polymer processing technology, end use and demonstration, standardisation, dissemination and training.

The combination of the researcher’s background and knowledge of care and migration and the substantial expertise of the host institution in comparative studies of care in Europe will enable an interdisciplinary and multi-national analysis of the position of migrant workers in European care systems. The two contextual backgrounds and the complementary methodological expertise of the partners in Critical Discourse Analysis (researcher) and Comparative Case Studies Analysis (the host institution, in particular the mentoring group) will allow the partners to develop a new methodological and analytical conceptualisation to study the moral, social, economic, political and cultural context of caring, in which migrants work, by investigating both national policy regimes and people’s reflections on their work trajectories. This project will adress at least two main issues of the future of European societies: Ageing societies have been identified as one of the main challenges for Europe in the Lisbon 2020 strategy and labour migration has been described as important measure to tackle shortcomings in markets. Apart from the politically, economically and socially significant investigation of the position of migrant care workers this cooperation will foster a novel approach in the study of the intersection of care regimes and migration regimes which can furthermore act as a tool for important future investigations combining political, economic, social and cultural perspectives.

That will be done by combing the Russian knowledge and data from pristine boreal forests to that from managed boreal forests in Finland in order to estimate boreal forest ecosystem resilience and stability and develop tools for sustainable forest management (SFM) and restoration. The results are of crucial importance for EU and national policy makers, state forest managers, forest owners, conservationists and NGOs in both Europe and Russia. RESTORE covers 3 types of activities: research, development and dissemination. RESTORE first time estimates stability and resilience using biodiversity indicators for species groups, structures and processes of key importance for biodiversity. Natural disturbances (fires and windthrows) and felling treatments are considered as perturbations. Originality and innovative nature of the project is in its unique dataset, a gradient from pristine to intensively managed forests, and system approach in practical implementation of basic research. The management and conservation tools will be developed according to resilience, return interval after disturbance and stability threshold of each ecosystem type depending on socio-economic context, management history, site conditions and natural disturbance regimes. The data collected and analyzed in RESTORE will be published at the European Forest Data Centre of the European Commission, managed by JRC in cooperation with Metla&amp;apos;s web team to define future guidelines for SFM.

Within this context, research on diagnostic imaging has recently gone hand in hand with the notion that the combination of various modalities is the key step towards improved diagnostic accuracy.<br/>Ultrasound (US) is promising for point-of-care imaging because, of its real-time display, high temporal and spatial resolution, low cost and safe of use. However, it falls short in terms of functional imaging. On the other hand optical techniques provide high contrast by the pronounced optical absorption variations in tissue and functional imaging when probing spectral features, but optical scattering limits the resolution of purely optical methods. Photoacoustic imaging (PA) shows optical absorption at ultrasound resolution via thermo-elastically generated ultrasound.<br/>The objective of FULLPHASE is the transition of PA imaging from a lab-based technique to a low-cost portable multi wavelength combined PA and US system. In order to reach that goal, the FULLPHASE partners offer specific expertise over complementary backgrounds in diode laser technology, laser beam shaping, ultrasound imaging technology, and system integration.

683,4760,No,Chemical tracing of fluid movement within and between geological reservoirs,"The principal objective is to improve our understanding of fluid movement within the continents, particularly the formation and filling of fluid reservoirs, and the consequences of fluid-rock interaction in permeable crust.    Fluid reservoirs are essentially regions of higher porosity than immediately adjacent regions, which have accumulated fluids derived from much larger volumes elsewhere in the continental crust or even the mantle. The aim is to define the regions from which fluids have been derived, as well as to understand the transport processes and (i) identify contributing sources, i.e. mantle, crust, atmosphere, (ii) quantify the relative amounts of, and the volumes that have provided fluids, (iii) define the timescale of fluid transport, and the physical controls on transport and emplacement into the reservoir, (iv) determine the extent of fluid-rock chemical interactions and modification of both fluid and rock chemistry, and (v) relate the dependence of reservoir existence and fluid transport to the broader tectonic regime.   The Project is a collaborative one between Universities of Cambridge, Nancy and BRGM, Orléans. It combines experience and modelling which is only easily achieved through European collaboration. Previous studies of deep fluids on the crust of W. Europe supported by CEC place Europe at the forefront on these scientific endeavours and provide the background for the present approach.   The approach is based upon the application of advanced techniques of fluid tracing in deep geological reservoirs, and new developments in the modelling of tracer transport. Both conservative tracers (He,Ne and Ar isotopes) to determine sources and the size of source regions and non-conservative tracers (Sr, U, Th and Ra isotopes) to constrain the extent, mechanisms and timing of fluid-rock interactions which control fluid chemistry will be used.

Integrating democratic and gender concerns,"In 2001, the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference launched the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) as a new policy framework on trade and development. Since then, numerous initiatives have been developed within the multilateral and regional trading systems aiming a t fostering this agenda. Notably, EU's efforts have focused on supporting capacity building to help stakeholders to participate effectively in multilateral negotiations. However, amidst these efforts few has been done to tackle the democratic and gender de fictis that at the local level are preventing an effective access of Southern counterparts in the world economy.  This study contributes in this respect because: 1. It brings together the literature on the North-South politics of global trade to democracy and gender concerns. Trade liberalization does not automatically lead to sustainable development and it often has detrimental effects on the most vulnerable social groups. This study contributes to draw connections between: (a) the challenges that policies of global trade have posed to emergent democracies; and (b) prevailing gender hierarchies in the South. 2. The study provides an empirical study on the steps that local civil society actors have followed to revert democratic and gender deficits in the politics of global trade. It asks how precisely, these proposals can be addressed in two relevant examples of North-South interactions: the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Economic Partnership, Political Co-ordination and Co-operation Agreement between the EU and Mexico (EU-MEX Agreement). 3. Finally, the study provides an informed assessment on the democratic and gender impacts of free trade agreements between Northern and Southern counterparts and of local civic activism's engagement in this debate. It is expected that this study will inform both policy at multilateral and regional arenas and civil society strategies at the local level.",0,0

The importance of soil NH4\ absorption is particularly relevant for plant growth under conditions of poor nitrification where NH4\ is the prevalent nitrogen source. Furthermore, in nitrogen fixing root nodules fixed nitrogen is transmiKed from the bacteria to the legume plant cells in the form of NH4\. Since they control whether the ion is taken up into the plant, NH4\ transport proteins play a strategic role in nitrogen efficiency. Despite this, the first genes encoding NH4\ transporters were only recently isolated, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. These transporters were found to constitute a new class of transport protein and to be highly conserved from bacteria to plants and animals. There is evidence that multiple NH4\ transporters exist in both S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana and recent data on expression of plant NH4\ transporters in root hairs is strongly indicative of their pivotal role in nitrogen nutrition. Interestingly, ammonium transporters also function as ammonium sensors at least in yeast. Nitrogen sensing is certainly of major importance for the development of root architecture. A manipulation of ammonium uptake and sensing should thus allow to increase nitrogen efficiency of crop plants at two levels: optimized uptake through more efficient transport at the plasma membrane and through improved root structure and surface.  The aim of this proposal is to carry out an integrated molecular and physiological analysis of NH4\ transport proteins in a variety of organisms (i) in nitrogen-fixing bacteria involved in transfer of nitrogen to the plant Rhizobium and in two model plants i.e. Arabidopsis and the legume Lotus. Yeast mutants, which served as a tool to identify the transporter genes will be used as tools to characterize plant transporters and to establish their role in ammonium sensing. The setting up of this multiple species-based approach was motivated by the apparent evolutionary conservation of NH4\ transporters, by the importance of the interaction of plants with microorganisms (symbiosis, competition) in NH4\ assimilation, and by the successful utilization of model organisms like yeast to isolate and characterize plant transporters.  Practically, the project aims to (i) isolate all the genes encoding different NH4\ transporters present in the abovementioned organisms, including possible efflux systems (ii) determine the biochemical and electrophysiological properties of each isolated transporter (iii) determine the tissue- and cell-specific distribution of plant NH4\ transporters (v) investigate the influence of environmental conditions on expression of NH4\ transporter genes (vi) to isolate strains lacking or overexpressing NH4\ transporters and to anal their phenotype with respect to the ability to acquire and assimilate NH4\. The ultimate goals will be to understand the molecular mechanism of this novel class of ion transporters, to evaluate the role of NH4\ transport proteins in nitrogen efficiency of both legume and non-legume model plants and to assess the feasibility to modify through genetic engineering plant and/or symbiotic bacteria characters in order to improve plant nitrogen efficiency. The gained knowledge will be transferred in a parallel approach into important crop species such as rape.  The planned work will also establish a model for interaction between EU labs and industrial partners having complementary expertise and a common biological interest analysed through different model organisms. Such a combination of scientific backgrounds, achievable only in a pan-European context, promises to lay new foundations for efficient and effective studies in fundamental aspects of biology of plants and interacting microorganisms which can be directly applied to agricultural and environmental improvement.",0,1
597,84903,No,GYROSCOPE: A multidisciplinary approach to host-shifting and invasive potential by gyrodactylid parasites,"Problem: In a global economy, the transfer of parasites to novel hosts can pose a major threat to both farmed and wild animal stocks. The effects of parasite invasion can have significant impacts on rural economies and biodiversity, but are difficult to evaluate in the short-term, since adaptation to new hosts occurs over an evolutionary time-scale.  Aims: - To study neutral genetic changes and adaptive evolution of morphology and virulence of gyrodactylid parasites associated with historical translocations of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). - To design a web-based database of gyrodactylids featuring genetic, ecological, morphological and biogeographic data. Background: The guppy has been translocated to ca. 40 countries worldwide over the last 75 years, resulting in the widespread introduction of non-native gyrodactylids.  This group of fish-parasites consists of ca. 20,000 species, the majority of which are still unknown to science. Gyrodactylids are renowned for their colonization abilities and pathogenicity, and one species alone, Gyrodactylus salaris has cost the Norwegian Salmon Industry >500 million € in 25 years. Gyrodactylids demonstrate biological plasticity including host-shifts, an evolutionary characteristic important for parasite invasion. Plan of work: We will utilize a multi-disciplinary approach (GYROSCOPE), integrating morphometrics, molecular systematics and experimental parasitology to identify and describe novel species, to study their invasion potential, and to evaluate DNA barcoding.  Analysis is performed at three evolutionary time-scales: - Macroevolutionary - natural range (5MYA), - Mesoevolutionary - human introductions (75 years), and - Microevolutionary - laboratory experiments (less than 10 years). Implications to EC: The proposal work will directly enhance our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning thereby contributing towards the objectives of sub-prioty 1.1.63 'Global Change and Ecosystems' of Framework 6.",1,0

A type of white blood cell, B cell, is causative for production of antibodies, key effectors to identify and neutralize viruses or bacteria. B cell can produce high affinity antibodies rapidly upon re-exposure to the same infectious agent, making B cell a key player for immunological memory, a principle of vaccination. Thus, full understanding on B cell biology is crucial for improvement of vaccination as well as prevention of B cell-diseases including B cell-cancers, immunodeficiency, a malfunction of immune system, and autoimmunity caused by aberrant immune response against its own cells and tissues. Recent discovery of microRNAs (miR)s, short RNAs promoting mRNA decay, has highlighted the importance of the regulation of mRNA decay in B cell development and function. Especially, miR-155 has been identified as an essential regulator for antibody production and its biogenesis appears to be mediated by a RNA-binding protein (RBP), KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP). KSRP is a versatile protein with abilities to facilitate miR generation, mRNA decay and splicing, a modification process of newly generated pre-mRNA, and it has been suggested that KSRP controls several key genes related to B cell functions. Thus, we propose that KSRP is an important gene regulator of B cell biology. The aim of this proposal is to identify Whether, in Which aspects and by Which function, the RBP, KSRP, Governs B cell development and function in B cell-intrinsic manner. To achieve this aim, we will perform phenotypic analysis using a unique mouse model system lacking KSRP gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis will allow identifying the genes that KSRP regulates in the context of observed phenotype. The results can generate new insights for gene regulation mechanisms in B cell biology and aid to pave a way for improvement of vaccination and novel treatments for B cell-diseases.'""",0,0
972,226994,No,An Investigation into the viability of employing lipoaspirate fluid as a cellular source in the production of small diameter tissue engineered vascular grafts,"Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) hold great promise in the field of regenerative medicine and also possess the true potential to revolutionise the way in which clinicians treat the growing burden of cardiovascular disease. Treatment is achieved by incorporating an appropriate cell source onto a biodegradable scaffold and implanting the graft to bypass non-patent vascular segments. However, numerous issues regarding TEVG cell source render the technique unviable in a clinical setting as the cells require high levels of manipulation including digestion, isolation and culture. These issues increase processing costs, decrease cell stability and raise numerous regulatory issues. The use of minimally manipulated liposuction aspirate fluid (LAF) may offer a safer and more efficient cellular source in regenerative TEVGs. However, the capacity of LAF to act as a viable cell source for TEVGs is untested. The aim of this pr oject is to determine the capacity of LAF derived cells to act as a viable cell source for TEVGs. This will be achieved through characterisation of the LAF cells, investigation of the environment that best promotes favourable cellular behaviour, an in vivo study on the viability of the graft to act as a vascular interposition in a small animal model, scaling of the graft to appropriate human size and finally an in vivo study of the grafts ability to function as a vascular bypass in a large animal model. This fellowship will have an outgoing phase to Prof David Vorp’s Lab at the University of Pittsburgh and a return phase to Prof Fergal O’Brien’s Lab at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.

949,46339,No,Flexible battery and load controller,"PROJECT OBJECTIVES  Power supply systems using photovoltaic or wind energy converters are the most promising sources of electricity for remote areas. Most of the smaller systems use direct current with the charge controller being the central component and the key to the quality of power supply and the lifetime of the battery. Due to the many battery and generator types a large variety of charge controllers is necessary. This leads to small production volumes and inhibits further price reduction. This project aims at the development of a charge controller with a large range of voltage ratios and an automatic battery detection useful for a wide choice of PV modules, small wind generators and batteries. The implementation of a 'plug and play' concept provides ease of use. The expandability of regenerative power supply by combined operation of charge controllers leads to easy system design.  TECHNICAL APPROACH  By means of a market survey the range of applications for the flexible charge controller will be established. Based on this information useful combination of charge controllers will be established. The functions of communication and battery management will be defined. The algorithms for maximum power point tracking, battery management, communications and the diagnostic system will be developed and tested by means of a laboratory circuit. Algorithms for the optimised control of small wind turbines will be established. Different power electronic topologies for the use in this device will be evaluated by means of simulation with special regards to high efficiency. A laboratory circuit will be constructed and optimised through extensive EMC and thermographic measurements. The laboratory circuit will be transferred to a prototype ready for extensive tests. All efforts concentrate on high reliability under all operation condition and production cost which will be accepted by the market. The prototype will be tested indoor at the laboratory and under outdoor condition.  EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION  A prototype of a flexible charge controller for the use with wind and solar power will have been developed and a small number of these pre-industrial devices will have been manufactured. Results and experiences obtained during the development and evaluation phase as well as the results of the market survey will be made available for dissemination. The flexible charge controller will allow an easy design of small stand alone power supply systems and therefore can reduce the costs of these systems.",0,0

Cell-based assays screenings are the key tool used to assess the potential efficacy of a new compound in drug discovery, as it provides a simple, fast, and cost-effective approach to avoid large-scale and cost-intensive animal testing at early stages. Therefore, the development of in vitro cell-based systems that can more realistically mimic the in vivo cell behaviours is a raising market, with a CAGR2013-2018 of 12.4% growth rate and quantified in $21.6 billion by 2018. Drug research cell-based assays are mostly conducted with cell cultures on flat surface (2D), but they differ from human tissues significantly and can respond aberrantly to stimuli, resulting in missed discoveries and late-stage clinical failures of drugs in development. In contrast, 3D cell systems have a greater predictable power as they can better mimic the physiological environment in organs and tissues. Still, 2D cell culture systems offer advantages like the simplicity of handling and high data reproducibility that are not found in the current 3D cell systems. The last ones are very difficult to handle and not ready-to-use ones, giving poor consistency, data reproducibility and poor workflow integration. In response, we have developed 3DProSeed, the first ready-to-use solutions in the 3D cell culture market.

3,212394,Yes,"New Entrant netWork: Business models for Innovation, entrepreneurship and resilience in European agriculture","Sustaining a cohort of new entrants is crucial to the ongoing vitality, resilience and competitiveness of the agricultural sector and  rural regions in Europe. New entrants bring with them innovation and entrepreneurialism, as well as practical skills and networks developed on farms and through off-farm employment. However, new entrants face considerable challenges in entering the sector, particularly access to land, capital, labour and markets, but also business skills and  knowledge development on both applied and  theoretical levels. Analysis  of Eurostat figures suggests that there is not an adequate replacement rate of young farmers in many European countries, although there  is evidence of considerable innovation  and comparatively high rates of new entrants in others (Zagata and  Sutherland, 2015). The NEWBIE Network (New Entrant netWork: Business models for Innovation, entrepreneurship and resilience in European agriculture) has been designed to address the significant challenge of enabling new entrants to successfully establish sustainable farm businesses in Europe. The NEWBIE network will facilitate the development and dissemination of new business models, including new entry models, to the full range of new entrants - from successors to complete newcomers to the agricultural sector.

177,36047,Yes,"Development of design and construction methods to stabilize soft organic soils for the construction of rail, road and other infrastucture","The continuality increasing demand for building land for industry, housing and infrastructure (roads, railways, ports and air fields) is forcing the construction industry to build on land that was previously identified as unsuitable. Much of this unsuitable land comprises natural deposits which, because they contain organic matter, are highly compressible. Organic soils (ranging from slightly organic clays to peat) are found in many countries of Europe. The construction of foundations and embankments on highly compressible soils results in unacceptable total and differential settlements unless the compressible soil is removed, the construction founded beneath the compressible soil or long term precompression by surcharge is carried out before construction. The industrial objective of the project is to provide the European construction industry with competitive construction techniques, backed by guidance documents for their use, to stabilize soft organic soils. The new construction techniques would stabilize the soil by mixing the soil with binders like cement, lime and/or other industrial secondary materials (such as pulverized fuel ash) to create columns of stabilized soil or by mass mixing in situ.  Similar techniques are in use for non organic soil. The use of the techniques for organic soil (ranging from slightly organic clays to peat) needs further development of equipment and binding materials by laboratory and full scale field tests to assess the environmental and engineering behaviour of the stabilized soil. The research will provide a proven technology for stabilization of organic soft soils in a cost effective way. By full scale field and laboratory tests new mixtures of binders will be developed to stabilize these soils in situ. These tests must prove that the new production methods are environmental friendly and in accordance with the national and European regulations. Development and testing of equipment (including monitoring and automation systems) will lead to better mixing, penetration trough fills, more homogeneous stabilized soil and saving of binding materials.  Methods will be developed for mix design given the soil parameters, methods to design the configuration of the column and mass stabilization and to predict the effectiveness of the stabilization (stiffness and remaining settlement). New control and automation methods will be developed and tested. Only full scale tests in different European organic soil types, each with different applications (new infrastructure, widening of existing rail and road infrastructure, industrial areas and dykes) can prove the economic and technical opportunities of the new techniques. The results of the equipment development, the new mixtures of binders, the field and laboratory tests, the monitoring and automation systems will be combined to a design guide.

386,208298,No,Fluvial Meta-Ecosystem Functioning: Unravelling Regional Ecological Controls Behind Fluvial Carbon Fluxes,"Fluvial ecosystems are an important element in the global carbon cycle metabolizing large amounts of terrigenous organic matter (tOM). This contributes to CO2 evasion fluxes that are under continuous reevaluation at the global scale. In contrast, research on the underlying processes is concentrated at the local ecosystem scale. This scale-gap seriously hampers process understanding across scales, limits upscaling accuracy, and reduces our scope of reaction strategies. Here, I suggest ground-breaking research on ecological processes at the intermediate ‘regional’ scale of the ‘fluvial network‘ to create a deeper mechanistic understanding of biogeochemically relevant carbon fluxes. My starting point is trifold: (1) detrital tOM has extremely high molecular-level diversity that requires consumers of equally high biodiversity for efficient respiration; (2) exactly this biodiversity of heterotrophic microbes, fungi and insects is constrained by metacommunity dynamics unfolding at a larger regional scale; and (3) the rules by which the conspicuously dendritic structure of the fluvial network shapes a metacommunity differ fundamentally from those governing regional diversity patterns of tOM resources. I hypothesize regional carbon dissimilation in ‘fluvial metaecosystems’ to be the interactive product of spatially partitioned resource and consumer diversities. I posit that this coupling of metacommunity structure to metaecosystem function is influenced by fluvial network topology, anthropogenic network fragmentation, and terrestrial matrix variation. Research will combine experiments in innovative lab-scale metaecosystems, spatially explicit modelling using cellular automata, and field studies spanning gradients of regional anthropogenic impact in real fluvial networks. I expect this cross-disciplinary research at the crucial landscape scale to generate novel mechanistic process understanding behind fluvial carbon fluxes in a world changing at ever faster pace.",0,0
693,220394,No,Structural basis for the therapeutic efficiency of optimal-affinity T cell receptors,"Demographic change includes population ageing, and incidence rates begin to increase for many types of cancer in middle-aged and elderly people. Traditional cancer treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, while tumour immunotherapy by T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer represents an alternative form of treatment. The transfer of tumour-specific TCR genes into patient’s peripheral blood lymphocytes targets cancer specifically and effectively. But while patient-derived low-affinity TCRs do not show therapeutic activity, optimal-affinity TCRs, as isolated from newly-generated antigen-negative humanized mice with a diverse human TCR repertoire, can effectively delay tumour regression. X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool of structural biology, which helps researchers to identify the three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules such as TCRs complexed to their cognate peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules. Recent research uncovered the docking topologies of naturally selected TCRs, but therapeutically efficient optimal-affinity TCRs recognizing tumour-associated self-antigens, have not been analysed to date. The exceptional specificity of TCRs is determined by three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the TCR alpha- and beta-chains. Biomedical research on TCR gene therapy and design of future clinical trials will hugely benefit from the identification of CDR-mediated contact points made between therapeutic TCRs and the pMHC on their target cells. TCRabX is an interdisciplinary research project investigating the 3D structures of 13 TCRs complexed to MHC-I or MHC-II, respectively. It connects innovative clinical immunology research in Berlin/Germany and world-class structural biology research in Melbourne/Australia.

100,193282,Yes,Novel biocontrol agents for insect pests from neuroendocrinology,"Insects are the most diverse Class of life on earth, and different insects can be essential for, or highly damaging to, agriculture, horticulture and forestry. There is a pressing need, not just for new insecticides to combat resistance, but more specific, “greener” insecticides that target deleterious insects while sparing beneficial ones. This proposal aims to identify such insecticides by turning the insects’ own hormones against them, both by designing artificial neuropeptide “mimetic” analogs as candidate compounds, and by generating transgenic insects that carry deleterious neuropeptide payloads within them, that can propagate through a population and impact on survival at times of stress.  We have assembled an international multi-actor consortium from EU member and associated member states, as well as a third country partner, with unparalleled experience in insect functional genomics, neuropeptide physiology, synthetic chemistry and synthetic biology, and in field-testing of candidates. Established links to agricultural, horticultural and forestry end-users, agencies/advisors and our SME partners ensure relevance to user need; and set out a pathway to exploitation and implementation of our results, for impact across three major economic sectors in the EU and globally.  We will deliver novel, ‘green’ neuropeptide-based insect pest biocontrol tools by: • utilising ‘beyond the State-of-the-Art’ technologies based on two approaches: rational design of neuropeptide hormone analogues; and development of genetically-encoded neuropeptides for translational insect synthetic biology in genetic pest management.  • bridging outstanding research and technology in neuroendocrinology and genetics to end user need, to ultimately produce neuropeptide hormone analogues and genetic pest management biocontrol tools. • validating and demonstrating these novel insect biocontrol agents in laboratory, field and forest applications, based on user need and a market-driven approach.",0,1
978,195525,No,Variation on a theme: evolutionary-developmental insights into the Asteraceae flower head,"Plant reproduction relies on flowers and their arrangement into inflorescence –two interrelated traits that exhibit impressive variation between plant lineages and constrain crop yields and horticultural forms. A key aim in evolutionary biology is to unravel how the modification of genetic networks has led to the diversification of reproductive plant architecture and floral form. This project addresses this aim by seeking to understand how two fundamental biological processes, floral architecture and symmetry, have evolved in the daisy family Asteraceae, with unique combinations of these traits. Much of the research on Asteraceae has concentrated on model plant systems with simple heterogamous capitula (e.g. gerbera, sunflower). We propose an original and novel evolutionary-developmental (evo-devo) approach to floral evolution, by bringing to this field the species of Asteraceae with secondary heads (=syncephalia). This unique capitulum architecture has arisen from two rounds of capitulescence (i.e. inflorescence condensation followed by simplification) during their evolution. Syncephalous species which comprise ca. 70 genera from 11 tribes provide an invaluable source of material for deciphering the genetic basis of capitulum evolution since their genomes bear the signature of two inflorescence shifts toward capitulescence. Our approach, integrating the most recent experimental and theoretical developments in evo-devo and genomics fields, provides a unique opportunity to ask fundamental questions relating to coordinated trait evolution, and to increase our understanding of how genetic pathways have been altered or co-opted during the evolutionary diversification of flowers. The knowledge gained has the potential to open up novel molecular breeding strategies for developing improved varieties of horticultural and crop plants in this family of great economical importance (e.g. artichoke, chrysanthemum, gerbera, knapweeds, lettuce, sunflower).",0,0

The investigation concentrated on the Mediterranean endemic species Salvia fruticosa Mill., Origanum vulgare L. subspecies hirtum letswaart, Satureja thymbra L. and Coridothymus capitatus Reichenb.  The high variation which was observed in almost all essential oil features denoted that there is a high variability among and within populations. The seasonal variation indicated the optimum harvesting time for desirable essential oil yield and composition. The latitudinal, logitudinal and altitudinal variation indicated that certain environmental conditions may favour certain essential oil characteristics.  Commercially desirable cultivars suitable for marginal lands have been selected to be used as alternative crops. The performance of each species under standard cultivation conditions was evaluated while the effect of different levels of nitrogenous fertilizer was examined. Growth, nutrient uptake and essential oil yield and composition at various levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were investigated in soilless culture. The ecophysiological aspects of seed germination, seed quality and seed preservation methods were studied.  A herbarium has been established in Chania which studies the flora of Crete. The traditional knowledge om aromatic and medicinal plants in Crete, which has unveiled valuable information, however is threatened by extinction. The investigation will focus on the production of commercially significant secondary metabolites (essential oils, alkaloids, glycosides) from some aromatic [Salvia fruticosa Miller (syn. S. triloba), Origanum vulgare L. ssp. birtum (Link) Ietswaart ('Q. heraclioticum' senso), Satureja thymbra L. and Coridothymus capitatus (L.) Roichenb. (syn. Thymus capitatus (L.)

The best essential oil producers will be selected for their adaptation to marginal lands, in order to substitute surplus crops.    The initial sampling includes a large variety of plant populations from the above species, in order to identify the effect of the site parameters (altitude, geographical latitude, exposure and soil pH) on essential oil yield and composition.

814,51241,No,Mechanisms and predictability of decadal fluctuations in atlantic-european climate,"Problems to be solved There is a need of climate-sensitive business and governmental bodies for improved understanding and prediction of fluctuations over decades of Atlantic-European climate. Also, better quantification of 'natural' climate variability over decades is needed in detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change. Scientific objectives and approach The project aims to improve understanding, simulation and prediction of the decadal fluctuations that result from interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. These aims will be achieved through a coordinated programme of numerical experimentation, evaluation against observations, and development of prediction systems. The predictability of decade time scale fluctuations in climate will be quantified and work will be done with targeted user groups in the insurance, utilities and fisheries sectors to assess the potential benefits of decadal forecasts. Output from a series of multi-decadal ensemble integrations from four atmospheric GCM's forced with observed twentieth century Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Ice Extent (SIE) will be used to assess the potential predictability of decadal fluctuations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and other facets of Atlantic-European climate. It will be investigated how the predictability of the atmospheric response to SST anomalies varies with season, atmospheric state and model and how the atmospheric response could feed back to force the ocean. Five ocean GCM's will be used for multidecadal ocean modelling. The models will be forced with observed atmospheric data (NCEP reanalyses), and the skill of the models to simulate major observed dynamic and thermodynamic decadal scale anomalies will be assessed in a common diagnostic framework. Particular emphasis will be given to oceanic regions that have been found in the atmospheric modelling above to significantly influence the atmosphere. The results of the various model runs will be used to assess sensitivity to model formulation and resolution. Based on the above results and by the analysis of multi-century control simulations with four coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM's mechanisms responsible for decadal fluctuations in climate will be clarified. Particular emphasis will be given to the role of tropical/extra-tropical interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the role of Gulf Stream variability and the role of air-sea fluxes in the amplification or damping of SST anomalies. The coupled models will be used to perform ensembles of decadal predictions and model predictability will be evaluated using the spread of the trajectories of the ensemble members. Expected impacts The project will improve the European capability in decadal climate prediction and will furthermore link directly to potential users (e.g. from utilities, insurance, tourism and fisheries industries). Future decadal predictions could significantly benefit these economic sectors.

For all crops grown during the experimental period, on increase of the caesium and cobalt concentration in the soil resulted in a higher availability of radiocaesium and radiocobalt for root uptake. After the application of caesium-134 and cobalt-57 and of additional stable caesium and cobalt to the soil surface considerable root uptake was observed, although these radionuclides were fixed in the upper 2 to 3 cm layer and the root uptake of nutrients in general takes place in the 5 to 25 cm soil zone. Thorough mining of the contaminated top 6 cm layer into the 0 to 30 cm plough layer produced only a small reduction. It was concluded that the transfer of radiocaesium and radiocobalt from soil into plants would increase in the first and second year after a high deposition, due to incomplete sorption and equilibration in the soil.  The results showed that deep ploughing with thorough mining into the plough layer and deep placement of the radionuclides could be a useful counter measure to reduce the radionuclides could be a useful counter measure to reduce the contamination of the food chain via plant root uptake. As compared to root uptake or transfer into storage organs or seeds, the uptake and translocation of radiocaesium from contaminated plant leaves into plant organs not yet formed at the time of contamination could be higher by several orders of magnitude. THE SCHEDULED EXPERIMENT PROGRAMME WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS FOLLOWS:   FOLLOWING THE MIXING OF CS-137 AND CO-60 INTO THE 0-30 CM SOIL LAYER OF 16 LYSIMETERS IN 1984 FOR THE SIMULATION OF LONG-TERM DEPOSITION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF RADIONUCLIDES, SUMMER BARLEY AND LETTUCE WILL BE PLANTED DURING THE 1985 VEGETATION PERIOD.  IN 1986, THE RADIONUCLIDES CS-134 AND CO-57 (ABOUT 0.5 MCI/NUCLIDE/LYSIMETER), EITHER WITHOUT A CARRIER OR WITH THE NON-RADIOACTIVE CARRIER SALT - I.E., IN LOW AND HIGH ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS, WILL BE SPRAYED ONTO THE PLANT OR SOIL SURFACES IN ONE OR FOUR APPLICATION OPERATIONS DURING THE VEGETATION PERIOD THUS SIMULATING AN ACCIDENT RELATED DEPOSITION OF THE RADIONUCLIDES CAESIUM AND COBALT IN VARYING CONCENTRATIONS AND FREQUENCIES OF THE ELEMENTS. IN 1986, SUMMER BARLEY WILL BE PLANTED AS THE MAIN CORP AND LETTUCE AS THE ROTATION CROP.  IN 1987, THE SOIL WILL BE TREATED NORMALLY - I.E., TO A DEPTH OF 30 CM - IN EIGHT LYSIMETERS. IN THE CASE OF THE REMAINING EIGHT LYSIMETERS, THE UPPER 10-15 CM OF SOIL WILL BE REMOVED AND, AFTER THE NEXT 35-40 CM HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT, REPLACED AT A DEPTH OF 50 CM. THIS IS INTENDED TO SIMULATE THE REMOVAL OF THE RADIONUCLIDES DEPOSITED ON THE SOIL SURFACE BY MEANS OF DEEP PLOUGHING. THE ONLY CROP TO BE PLANTED IN ALL LYSIMETERS WILL BE CARROTS.  IN 1988, POTATOES AND, AS THE ROTATION CROP, KIDNEY BEANS WILL BE PLANTED. IN THE NEXT PERIOD (1989), WINTER WHEAT WILL BE USED, WITH ALFALFA AS THE ROTATION CROP.  BY IMPLEMENTING THIS EXPERIMENTAL PLAN AND USING VARIOUS CAESIUM AND COBALT ISOTOPES, IT IS INTENDED TO STUDY ON A COMPARATIVE BASIS THE SOIL/PLANT/FOOD-CHAIN TRANSFER OF THESE RADIONUCLIDES BOTH AFTER LONG-TERM DEPOSITION CAUSED BY ROUTINELY OCCURRING LOW EMISSIONS AND AFTER THE DEPOSITION OF A LARGE QUANTITY OF RADIONUCLIDES CONSEQUENT UPON AN ACCIDENT. THE CHOICE OF PLANTS AND SOIL WORKING METHODS ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THE VARIOUS PARAMETERS ON SOIL/PLANT TRANSFER: E.G. THE KINETICS OF ROOT ADSORPTION, THE EFFECT OF FREQUENCY AND HEIGHT OF RADIONUCLIDE DEPOSITION, CONTAMINATION OF THE SOIL OR THE PLANTS. COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTEMENT D'ETUDES ET DE RECHERCHES EN SECURITE  (DERS) AND THE SERVICE D'ETUDES ET DE RECHERCHES SUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT (SERE), CEN, CADARACHE, WILL ALSO ENABLE A COMPARISON TO BE MADE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE RADIONUCLIDES UNDER VARIOUS CLIMATIC CONDITIONS (DRY MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE AND WET WESTERN-EUROPEAN CLIMATE).",0,0

131,107230,Yes,Adaptive Responses to Climate Change,"'The major challenge in climate-change ecology is to predict the impact of future climate change on populations. To provide the most realistic way to forecast the future of key species, we must consider simultaneously demographic (e.g. growth, rate of survival and reproduction), physiological/behavioural mechanisms (e.g. hormonal responses, thermal tolerances, huddling) and genetic vs phenotypic variation. However integrative mechanistic population models that incorporate these processes remain scarce. The ARC project meets this challenge and responds today to the need of a complete framework. It will provide a mechanistic view of the causes and consequences of populations’ responses to climate change to predict their distribution and implement accurate conservation strategies. My project presents a rare combination of data, skills and experience by combining a long-term (1990-2012) dataset and experimental explorations of the proximal mechanisms using the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) as a model species. Using a four-tier approach, I will (i) investigate environmental and social factors that influence phenotypic and phenological traits affecting  population dynamic; (ii) determine the physiological mechanisms underlying the critical trait-demography relationships; (iii) identify the relative roles of evolutionary and ecological responses. Then, I will integrate demographic, physiological and evolutionary processes identified above to predict the change in this alpine species’ range and evaluate its vulnerability or resilience to current climate change. To elucidate the complexity of adaptive responses to climate change, it brings together complementary knowledge and methods from disparate disciplines. The multi-disciplinary approach and state-of-the-art methods proposed by the ARC project is a crucial step towards a more comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the influence of climate change on population viability and, ultimately, on biodiversity.'",1,1
126,4956,Yes,Deposition of ozone and nitrogen dioxide to european forest,"The objective of this multidisciplinary project is to obtain reliable values for the deposition velocity of O3 and NO2 to European forests.   Only very few data on the dry deposition velocity of ozone over forest are available. For NO2 the situation is even worse - hardly any measurements over forest are reported. There is need for a generalized framework to interpret experimental data in order to generalize and derive deposition loads to regions. Specific tasks of this project will be: 1) to derive parameters such as flux-profile functions describing turbulent exchange of trace gases over different forests, 2) assess the influence of stand architecture and ecosystem type, 3) study the effect of atmospheric chemical reactions, 4) obtain a continuous record of O3 deposition fluxes to forests, and 5) study gas exchange processes taking place in the canopy. In this way generalisation of measurements carried out at one location can be based on understanding of relevant processes.  Other tasks will be as follows: 1) continuous measurement of O3 deposition to coniferous forest, 2) experimental study of flux-profile functions for trace gases over forest, 3) short-term, intensive, campaign studies measuring NOX and O3 fluxes in different forests: coniferous and deciduous, 4) modelling of trace gas exchange in forests, and 5) 3D model calculations. The comparison of results from different forests is an important aspect of this project. Therefore relevant equipment from the groups involved will be evaluated in a joint experiment. The results of measurements and model calculations will be interpreted jointly by all principal investigators. These results will be used to assess the influence of forests on O3 budgets over reactions in Europe by 3D model calculations.",1,1
821,227782,No,Sustainable Valorization Of The Algae Industry Waste-Stream Within An Advanced Clean Technologies-Based Integrated Biorefinery Concept,"The management of the growing amount of food waste is considered as an urgent environmental and economic burden by the European Commission. In response to this challenge, the Algwas-Bior Project proposes an integrated Biorefinery technology, focusing on the valorization of the waste stream released from the algae industry following agar extraction Gelidium sesquipedale. The hydrocolloid-centric extraction of this seaweed generates a large quantity of waste rich in organic materials and biologically active compounds. In Europe, a modest focus has been accorded so far to the industrial valorization of these compounds, particularly for the development of value-added food additives, pharmaceutical ingredients, and health-promoting products. The cascade technology will be a versatile solution adaptable to a wide range of food industry waste-stream valorization, thus, moving up the waste hierarchy through coupling the biomass and production sector in a solid circular Bioeconomy. The methodology combines high-quality process performance data generation supported by automated data acquisition and process control systems along with cutting edge analytical methods. The interdisciplinary concept mostly based on supercritical and subcritical fluids technologies, expanded to modern, clean technologies will be subjected to pilot-scale testing and process validation using the facilities of Hiperbaric as a secondment. The proposal will deliver state-of-the-art training to the researcher in these technologies within a three-way transfer of knowledge with the host institution and industrial partners. The results will lead to the development of commercialisable process that will reinforce the competitiveness of the food industry and will contribute to the strategy of the European Union to build a strong circular and bio-economy leading to the creation of viable green job opportunities.",0,0
706,83650,No,Study of the oversolubility of gases in liquids of nanometric volume,"This project deals with the study of a basic phenomenon: the solubility of gases in liquids, which has many implications in physics, chemistry and engineering. What makes this proposal original is the nanometric scale of the system studied. Goals The main objective of this project is to understand why recent solubility measurements, on nanometer-scale gas/liquid systems, show values much higher than in a macroscopic bulk: what we called the oversolubility effect. A second objective is to build up a predictive model of the effect, as a function of the nature of the gas, the solvent, and the system size. A third objective deals with the search of possible applications of this effect, particularly for gas storage (hydrogen, carbon dioxide). Expected results Apa rt from the above model, the main expected results are quantitative data of the nano-scale oversolubility effect, for as much gas / liquid systems as possible. The results will be obtained as a function of temperature, gas pressure, and solvent volume size . We will focus on general interest systems in process engineering, such as H2, O2, N2, and gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid hydrocarbons and water. Special attention will be given to systems including CO2 as a gas, due to its importance in the current globa l warming, and to those including H2, for its potential use as energy source. If the results are favourable, first tests of storage applications for these two gases will be considered. Methodology Three measurement methods will be used: - Quantitative NMR. - Micro-catharometric analysis. This device will be set up together with a high throughput feed and acquisition unit. - Micro-volumetric studies, based on very precise pressure sensors and temperature cycles. For modelling studies, the hypothesis of a pure ly physical effect will be used as a first ground, considering the preliminary results. As a function of further results, this approach may evolve.",0,0
786,47201,No,High-lift devices with variable camber for an adaptive wing,"Research objectives and content Aim of the research project is development and realization of a wing element with variable camber (flap or control surface). Wing structures are actually realized as a system of rigid bodies (main wing, ailerons, flaps, etc.) and the aerodynamic field are influenced by changing relative positions of these parts. If it was possible to variate wing geometry by more than these degrees of freedom, e.g. allowing shapes changes in some wing elements, large advantages will be achieved in controlling aerodynamic field and hence flight dynamics. In the past some investigations in this field were performed, however, none of the proposed solutions was realized in practice. In fact realization of a controlled variable geometry with conventional techniques requires heavy and complex mechanisms. 'Smart structures' strategy open a new perspective for the adaptive wing concept, in fact these new materials make geometric variability feasible without the above mentioned disadvantages. In the proposed research this possibility will be investigated in particular for high-lift device with variable camber. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact) The objective is the realization of a wing element with variable camber. A qualifying experience in the smart structure field will be the main benefit of the proposed training. Moreover experiencing into following topics is expected: solid state actuators: design, structural integration, experimental properties evaluation; aircraft structures; composite materials. Links with industry / industrial relevance (22) The idea to provide a wing with variable camber is clearly interesting for the aeronautical transports. In fact such a realization could be introduce large advantages concerning manoeuvrability, safety and fuel consumption and, as a consequence, a great improvement in European aeronautical industry.",0,0
749,213160,No,Building the Legal Knowledge Graph for Smart Compliance Services in Multilingual Europe,"European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies operating internationally face multiple difficulties to trade abroad and to localise their products and services in other countries. Complying with regulatory and legal aspects is crucial for these companies, who usually delegate the task to law and consultancy firms. These firms have to identify, retrieve and process documents from several sources, in multiple languages, and published by various institutions according to different criteria and formats. Such a burdensome task is hindering European SMEs to sell across borders, and thus reducing its competitive potential. Current content and data analytics solutions are mature to be transferred to the market and leverage the new opportunities created by the data linking paradigm and the open data movement. Lynx aims to create a knowledge graph of legal and regulatory data towards compliance, in which heterogeneous data sources from different jurisdictions, languages and orders are aggregated and interlinked by a collection of advanced services. Building on this legal knowledge graph, a Lynx platform will offer compliance-related functionality focused on three specific business cases. In a first pilot, legal compliance solution for data protection will be offered, where data protection related documents are innovatively managed, analysed, and visualised across different jurisdictions. In the second pilot, the Lynx platform will help understanding regulatory regimes (norms and standards) related to operations in the Oil & Gas and Energy sectors.  The third pilot will provide a compliance solution in the labour law domain, where legal provisions, case law, administrative resolutions, and expert literature will be interlinked, analysed, and compared to define legal strategies in the context of legal practice. European citizens will also benefit from this solution because they will gain free access to a new collection of aggregated and interlinked legal data.",0,0
841,210407,No,EggXYt: A novel approach for sexing chicken embryos on day one before incubation - saving them from being hatched and disposed.,"In the layer industry, chicks are culled (culling is the process of killing newly hatched poultry for which the industry has no use) by billions on an annually basis via suffocation or grinding or even more cruel methods. The males are terminated since they are not useful for laying eggs or to be bread for meat and the weak or unhealthy females are being terminated as well. Thus, more than 7 billion male chicks are killed on day of hatching generating an annual loss of ~1 Billion Dollars (cost of unnecessary hatching, human employees as sexers and waste management) ,associated carbon emissions, ethical and environmental impacts. Clearly a method for in-ovo, or embryo sex-determination prior to hatching (incubation) is thus highly desired due to both ethical and economic considerations.   Our added value: We have developed a patented method –using cutting edge technologies in biology and optics - to detect the sex of the 1 day embryo immediately after being laid and before entering the 21 day incubation process. In other words, we are developing the morning after pill for chicks!!! This way, our clients  - hatcheries (and practically the whole industry) are saving money, they will not need to deal with chick culling and can use the unhatched male containing eggs in secondary markets where eggs are used as an ingredient (e.g. pharma, pastry etc.). We are bringing a novel approach that contributes to i) Saving over 7 billion chick lives annually ii) Saving the industry ~ 1 Billion dollars annually and iii) adding over 7 billion eggs to the global food supply.",0,0
697,57174,No,Electronic Technology Management Solution,"Companies have recognised the need for production processes that boost product performance and drive down costs. Experts and resources required to plan and realise this processes are often unavailable. Technology planners and decision-makers are also confronted with a flood of information when investigating innovative technologies. To solve these problems the eTEMsolution has been developed. This ICT-tool consists of a workflow, document, user and competence system, databases, search engines and intelligent agents. The objective of the trial project is to enable a detailed and specified evaluation of the eTEMsolution. Within the trial project the eTEMsolution will be customised and implemented in three technology oriented companies, where it will be used to solve existing problems. The trial should demonstrate the advantages of introducing the software for the user partners and will generate insights and experiences that can be used to overcome the last barriers for its exploitation.  Objectives: The overall objective of the eTEMsolution is to enable users in the producing industry to carry out professional technology management projects by using an web-enabled tool for technology management. Relevant technology and product data are generated, administered and made available for support in the decision process is supported. The basis for a decision is archived and is easily available later. Spread technology planners, designers and technology experts working in one value chain are better connected by using the eTEMsolution as a basis for communication and data exchange. The trial project aims to validate the eTEMsolution in order to support technology selection and planning for industrial SMEs. For the user partners the goal of this trial project is to demonstrate the advantages that can be realised through broader take-up of the eTEMsolution, for the technology suppliers to gather the insights and experiences that can be used to overcome the barriers for successful exploitation of their new products, services and knowledge.  Work description: Within the ETEM trial project the eTEMsolution will be implemented in three technologically oriented production companies, where it will be used to solve existing problems within their products and the product planning process. In order to be able to broadly test the eTEMsolution industrial companies with complementary production ranges were chosen. They have complementary needs for production technologies and for the technology management process. To guarantee that the trial project leads to a valuable increase of quality and efficiency of the user partners business processes, a number of workpackages will be carried out within the trial project.  These workpackages have been grouped in four project-phases. Phase 1 (WP1) builds one reference case per user partner, so the situation before and after the implementation of eTEMsolution can be compared. Phase 2 (WP2, WP3) entails the preparatory activities needed to facilitate the actual use of the eTEMsolution and tailor it to the specific needs of the user partners. Phase 3 (WP4, WP5) is essential for the trial project as it implies the first application of the eTEMsolution to the actual commercial business cases. Over a period of 10 months the user partners will test the eTEMsolution. Relevant results and experiences of the trial project will be measured and evaluated. During phase 4 (WP6) the results will be disseminated within the consortium members and a plan for scaling up the eTEMsolution will be developed. The know-how resulting from the trial project will be disseminated to other organisations and companies that could profit from the experiences gained during the trial project. In the end a plan for further exploitation of the eTEMsolution will be made. A separate workpackage (7) will be executed during phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 to foster a conscientious project execution. This workpackage for project management ensures the overall control and guards the project objectives.  Milestones: After 6 months the 1st milestone (MS) delivers reference cases and customisation, implementation and training of the eTEMsolution. After 9 months the 2nd MS delivers the first results of the measurements, dissemination plan and midterm progress report. The 3rd MS delivers the final trial results, final validation, baseline projects, disseminated results and exploitation plan. The expected results for the users are cost reduction (10%), quality improvement, shorter time-to-market (30%) and process stability (\15%). For the technology suppliers the result will be a validated tool to be commercialised.",0,0
548,222873,No,"The origin, distribution, and dissemination of the apple microbiome","The success of any agricultural system and sustainable production depends on the health of its plants. Pests and pathogens are responsible for the loss of almost one-third of the global crop production. However, microorganisms found in and on plants are not always the cause of disease. Instead, the naturally occurring microbial communities, the plant’s microbiome, play an essential role in the development of healthy plants. This project is based on a hypothesis-driven approach to address fundamental questions about the plant microbiome such as What is the source of a plant’s microbiome? What are the pathways of inheritance and acquisition? How does the microbiome move, disseminate, and enter a new host? Apple was selected as a plant model; a fruit that has been a principal component of a healthy diet, and played a major role in human evolution and survival. The proposed methodology employs cutting-edge and multidisciplinary techniques such as metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, among others. Results of this project will help to understand the microbiome’s life cycle, associate microbes with specific organs and tissues, and identify microbial species that define a healthy host with healthy organs and offspring. From there, it will be easy to determine changes, understand disease and disorders, and find ways to correct unbalanced microbiomes. Identifying how the microbes are acquired and to which organs and tissues they are associated with, will help in understanding the optimal methods to introduce microbial species to the host. While the proposed approaches are novel, once the validity of the hypotheses is proven, they will serve as a foundation for future microbiome studies. These studies will drive the development and implementation of safe, environmentally-friendly strategies for global agriculture production. These innovations in the management of plant health have myriad positive and far-reaching implications for environmental and human health.",1,0
719,94940,No,Open Source Software Reuse Service for SMEs,"The proposed project aims to develop a set of methodologies, associated tools, and business models centred on SME Associations, which will enable software SMEs to effectively introduce Open Source Software Reuse practises in their production processes. In this scope, software reuse is regarded as the sharing of software modules across different development teams, organisations, and diverse application domains. The potential benefits from the adoption of Software Reuse practises by software SMEs could provide substantial competitive advantages against large players by improving productivity, increasing competitiveness (offer more competitive prices), and facilitating entrance to new markets. The main reasons prohibiting the adoption of Software Reuse solutions by software SMEs are the following: (1) The large initial investments in technology know-how and tools required for a successful software reuse program are inhibiting reuse for SMEs, since their budget is limited. (2) Effective accumulation of modules requires multiple products in different application domains. Software development SMEs typically develop only a limited number of products or just a single system that evolves in different versions. (3) The market presently lacks services that would allow the effective identification, cataloguing, reshaping and utilisation of open source software components. This significantly prohibits the reuse of code concerning application functionality, which is common to a limited set of domains. The OPEN-SME project aims to provide a viable solution to the aforementioned SME problems, by developing appropriate methodologies and tools, and defining adequate business models that will allow SME Associations to effectively provide Open Source Software Reuse services to their member software SMEs. In this sense, SME Associations will act as the “software reuse departments” of their members.",0,0

The DSS will be seamlessly integrated with the existing ICT for controlling each site's energy sub-systems, thereby facilitating the operators' real-time on-site generation dispatch, off-site energy purchases from diverse sources, and open positions in energy markets. The DSS will also enable long-term planning aimed at increasing energy efficiency, specifically analysis of retrofits and/or expansion of on-site energy sub-systems, in order to meet forthcoming EU targets for reducing CO2 emissions. A laboratory facility in Bizkaia, Spain will serve to test the operation of the DSS, while a community centre in northern Spain and a college campus in Austria will be the venues for the validation exercise. These site tests will enable cost-benefit analyses along with policy lessons for potential users of the DSS via workshops so that they may be able to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 10% in certain cases and improve sub-system integration in line with EU targets. In conjunction with preliminary market analyses and an exploitation plan, the DSS will be ready to make a wide impact at the project's termination by leading to the opening of a market for ICT-based solutions for buildings.",0,0
774,43696,No,Multi Instrument Investigation of Polar Stratospheric Cloud Formati on And The Heterogeneous Chemistry Involved In Stratospheric Ozone Depletion,"The proposal describes a multi-disiplinary approach which seeks to unite stratospheric aerosol data and improved state-of-the-art atmospheric modelling tools in order to investigate polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation and the heterogeneous chemistry involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. The scientific objectives of the proposal are  - to determine the extinction spectrum of PSC particles,  - to quantify the conditions under which polar stratospheric clouds form,   - to model ozone loss in the lower stratosphere,  with the aim of providing information to build a better quantitative understanding of the ozone layer so that the present state of the layer can be explained and its future evolution predicted.The proposal involves the use of measurements from two Arctic and two Antarctic lidar stations, from an airborne lidar, from a nove] in situ backscattering device, from an optical particle counter, and rrom instruments on the 'Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and from the Improv d Lim Arrat Spectrometer (ILAS). The use of such a disparate measurement-dataset is innovative in that it will tightly constrain PSC formation and heterogeneous chemical modelling and avoid biases that can be introduced in single instrument studies. Included in the proposal are fundamental laboratory measurements of PSC particles essential to the interpretation of existing and proposed PSC data. The project aims to develop an innovative inversion algorithm to estimate key PSC properties including surface area density (which will be validated by lidar and in situ measurements) from infrared spectral measurements. A clear advance in this proposal is the sampling of high resolution satellite data along Lagrangian trajectories so that the evolution and decay of a PSC can be examined. In doing so the chemical changes within an airparcel are effectively decoupled from the dynamics allowing a clear picture of PSC formation and heterogeneous processing to be obtained. This technique has only recently become available since the rovision of UARS data and will have wide application to future European atellite instruments. Quantitative understanding of stratospheric proceesses will be expressed within a numerical model of the atmosphere which includes the best possible descriptions of the important physical and chemical processes (PSC formation, heterogeneous processing, ozone depletion) obtained from fundamental laboratory and atmospheric studies.  the work proposed addresses objectives specified in Area 1.2 of the Environment and Climate RTD workprogramme.  The overall objective of the European Community is the improved and continued welfare of its citizens. By working together a European research team will make significant advances at the frontier of our  knowledge of the atmosphere.",0,0

SUCH ESTIMATES ARE OFTEN OVER-RESTRICTIVE AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR MORE REALISTIC VALUES BASED ON TIME-DEPENDENT TRANSFERS OF RADIONUCLIDES UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS. THESE WILL PROVIDE DATA TO ENABLE MORE PRECISE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES TO BE PERFORMED ON SUCH CRITERIA AS LAND RE-UTILISATION, CROP USAGE AND MOVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC.  RESEARCH IN RECENT YEARS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE HAS BEEN AIMED AT DETERMINING TIME-DEPENDENT TRANSFER FACTORS BETWEEN SOILS AND CROPS UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS. IN PARTICULAR, CEC SUPPORT UNDER THE 3RD RADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAMME HAS ENABLED THE EFFECT ON UPTAKE OF CS-137, RU-106, CE-144 AND SB-125 INTO WHEAT OVER THE COURSE OF CONSECUTIVE GROWING SEASONS TO BE DETERMINED WITH RESPECT TO VARIATIONS IN SOIL TYPE, CLIMATE, AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE AND DIETARY HABIT WITHIN THE MAIN WHEAT GROWING REGIONS OF THE CEC. THIS WORK IS ESSENTIALLY OF A LONG-TERM NATURE, USING LARGE LYSIMETERS SUBJECTED TO A SINGLE SURFACE APPLICATION OF THE RADIONUCLIDES. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LARGE WIND-TUNNEL, IN WHICH CROPS WILL BE CONTAMINATED DIRECTLY FROM THE AIR WITH RADIONUCLIDE AEROSOLS, WITH PARTICLE SIZES WITHIN THE RANGE ANTICIPATED FROM ACCIDENTAL RELEASES, AND UNDER AERODYNAMIC CONDITIONS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FIELD.  THIS PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT FURTHERING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AFFECTING UPTAKE AND SUBSEQUENT RETENTION OF RADIOACTIVE AEROSOLS BY AERIAL PLANT PARTS, AND ELUCIDATING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SOIL- PLANT AND AIR - PLANT PATHWAYS FOR SELECTED RADIONUCLIDES ON THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIVE DOSE TO MAN.  Following simulated reactor accidents, the time dependent transfer of radionuclides from the atmosphere and the soil to crops has been studied.   Continuation of lysimeter studies with cabbage, with sequential harvests up to maturity. Estimation of changes in the exchangeable; total Cs ratio in experimental soils from all harvests throughout the programme. Measurement of contribution of soil resuspension to contamination of aerial plant parts, using Ti as a tracer. Dual-isotope experiment with cabbage in the wind-tunnel followed by assessment of the fate of the foliar and soil applied Cs up to maturity. A RANGE OF MAJOR CROP SPECIES, INCLUDING WHEAT, GRASS SWARDS, LEAF VEGETABLES, ROOT VEGETABLES AND FRUITS WILL BE CONTAMINATED IN THE WIND-TUNNEL WITH CS-137, RU-106, CE-144 AND SB-125 AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF GROWTH, AND TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD, WHERE THE SUBSEQUENT FATE OF THE RADIONUCLIDES WILL BE FOLLOWED WITH RESPECT TO UPTAKE, TRANSLOCATION, AND FIELD-LOSS. THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATIC VARIABLES, PARTICULARLY WIND AND SURFACE WETNESS, ON FOLIAR DEPOSITION WILL ALSO BE STUDIED IN THE WIND-TUNNEL EXPERIMENTS. ON SELECTED SUITABLE CROPS, THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AERIAL DEPOSITION AND UPTAKE VIA THE SOIL WILL BE DETERMINED USING DIFFERENT ISOTOPES OF THE SAME ELEMENTS (CS-134/CS-137; RU-103/RU-106; CE-141/CE-144; SB-122/SB-125) FOR THE TWO PATHWAYS: ONE ISOTOPE WILL BE APPLIED TO THE SOIL, WITH THE AERIAL PART OF THE PLANT PROTECTED FROM CONTAMINATION, FOLLOWED BY A SECOND AERIAL APPLICATION WITH THE OTHER ISOTOPE, WITH THE SOIL SURFACE BUT NOT THE PLANT PROTECTED; THE PLANTS WILL THEN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIELD AND THE SUBSEQUENT FATE OF THE TWO ISOTOPES DETERMINED. THE STUDIES WILL ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CHEMICAL FORMS OF THE RADIONUCLIDES ON DEPOSITION AND RETENTION BY CROPS.  WHILE THE WIND-TUNNEL HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO STIMULATE AERODYNAMIC CONDITIONS IN THE FIELD AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE, IT CANNOT, HOWEVER, PROVIDE FULLY REALISTIC FIELD CONDITIONS. THUS IT IS DESIRABLE TO CONTAMINATE CROPS IN THE FIELD, AS WELL AS IN THE WIND-TUNNEL IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LATTER SIMULATES REALISTIC CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS PRECLUDE THE USE OF RADIONUCLIDES IN QUANTITY IN THE FIELD. THUS IT IS PROPOSED TO COMPARE THE UPTAKE BY CROPS AND FATE OF THE RADIONUCLIDES, WITH THAT OF THEIR STABLE ANALOGUES, IN A SERIES OF WIND-TUNNEL EXPERIMENTS. IF THE STABLE ANALOGUES PROVE TO BE SUITABLE AS A SURROGATE FOR THE RADIONUCLIDES, THEN A SERIES OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT, WITH AERIAL APPLICATION, FOLLOWED BY NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS.  FOLIAR CONTAMINATION IS ONLY OF IMPORTANCE IN THE SHORT-TERM, FOLLOWING AN ACCIDENT. THUS IT IS PROPOSED TO DETERMINE THE MEDIUM/LONG-TERM FATE OF RADIONUCLIDES IN SOIL/CROP SYSTEMS BY CONTINUING THE EXISTING LYSIMETER EXPERIMENTS, BUT EXTENDED TO THE CROPS USED IN THE WIND-TUNNEL EXPERIMENTS. RESUSPENSION OF CONTAMINATED SOIL PARTICLES ONTO AERIAL PARTS OF THE PLANTS WILL BE MEASURED, USING TI AND SC SOIL TRACERS; THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BE ALSO USED IN THE WIND-TUNNEL EXPERIMENTS, AS APPROPRIATE. APPLICATION OF A SECOND RADIONUCLIDE OF THE SAME ELEMENT TO SOILS IN THE LYSIMETERS WILL ENABLE A COMPARISON TO BE MADE OF SHORT-TERM UPTAKE INTO CROPS WITH THAT RESULTING FROM SEVERAL YEARS EQUILIBRATION IN THE SOIL.

580,106732,No,Impact of stress-induced transposon activities on human disease,"The evolutionary success of transposable elements (TEs) is underscored by the finding that about 45% of the human genome is TE-derived. However, recent high throughput approach studies indicate that the impact of TE-associated activities was seriously underestimated. The first objective is to investigate the impact of TE-derived activities on the human genome in general and on disease mechanisms in particular, based on the central premise that some of these activities are stress-induced. To model how a vertebrate-specific transposon responds to stress signals in human cells, I will study molecular interactions of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon with host cellular mechanisms to understand how stress-signalling and response triggers transposon activation. My second aim is to decipher the relationship between stress-induced activation of endogenous TEs and TE-derived regulatory sequences and human disease. I aim at investigating conditions and the consequences of activation of a particular copy of the MERmaid transposon located in the Sin3B transcriptional corepressor, frequently observed in cancer. The impact of global epigenetic remodelling will be investigated in the model of a complete (induced pluripotency) and partial (trans-differentiation) epigenetic reprogramming. In parallel, I aim at translating experience accumulated in TE research to cutting-edge technologies. First, the SB transposon will be adopted as a safe, therapeutic vector to treat age-dependent blindness (AMD). Second, a mutagenic SB vector will be used in a forward genetic screen to decipher a genetic network that protects against hormone-induced mammary cancer. The anticipated output of my research programme is a refined understanding of the consequences of environmental stress on our genome mediated by TE-derived sequences. The project is expected to provide an effective bridge between basic research and clinical- as well as technological translation of a novel gene transfer technology.",0,0

305,75757,No,Control and smart devices,"Due to their capacity to propose a large functionality panel, thin polymer or polymer-like films have a huge potential to revolution the European citizen way of living. Recent studies are showing that polymeric film with controlled nanoscale features (thic kness, composition, porosity, roughness, surface structures or inclusions such as nanoparticles) can provide systems with radically new chemical or physical properties. On the other hand, market constraints make production rate a critical factor for produc t success. In traditional sectors such as large scale steel and glass surfaces manufacturing, coil coating, dip coating and spray techniques are actual fully industrialized and high volume processes. However, they all run at high thickness and without mast ering the nanostructure itself. Therefore, merging nanoscale precision with mass production constraints is a key challenge to open the door for new generations of high added value products. NAPOLYDE project targets this challenge throughout three objective s: 1. New process technologies: NAPOLYDE consortium will develop new technologies for polymer or polymer-like films deposition at nano-scale precision supporting mass production and environmental friendly requirements. It will include: Robust and scalable deposition technologies, Measurement instruments and design tools, Scale-up methodologies and know-how. 2. Enabling new properties for high added value products: Nanoscale precision will enable introduction and combination of advanced functionalities (high efficiency barriers, transparency, high porosity, anti-reflectivity, anti-scratch, light emission, super-hydrophobicity, anti- adhesion,..) into components included in every day products (airplanes, buildings, automobiles, mobile phones...).

681,85129,No,Oral bio-lubrication and bio-adsorption from multi-phased complex fluids,"There is a considerable rise in obesity within Europe which is driving a consumer need for processed food and beverages that have health and vitality benefits. Food companies are under increasing pressure to significantly reduce sugar, fat and salt levels, as well as formulate products that target specific consumer groups for nutritional efficacy. However, the replacement of such ingredients with healthier alternatives, or inclusion of benefit agents, typically renders a product unacceptable to consumers due to mouth feel and taste considerations.  The physical origin of mouth feel and taste is from the dynamic response of products between oral biosurfaces. During oral processing, such products which are typically multi-phased complex fluids and soft solids are sheared and compressed, while various components may deposit onto oral surfaces and/or disrupt salivary films. At the same time, saliva is secreted into the oral cavity for mixing and reacting with the food/beverage. The resulting product is confined to very thin films between soft rubbing surfaces (i.e. the tongue and palate), which determines oral lubricity and thus mouthfeel and textural attributes of food, as well as mass transport of tastants to receptors on the tongue and aromas to olfactory receptors in the nose.  The development of techniques to characterise the dynamic behaviour of complex fluids under confinement in response to this environment will lead to the ability to create new design rules for controlling the sensorial response of consumer products with healthier compositions, enabling enhancement of quality and nutritional value. To achieve this we require the combination of world leading expertise in surface science and oral protein chemistry from the YKI Institute of Surface Chemistry with the expertise in soft-tribology, rheology and sensory science of consumer products at the Unilever Corporate Research.",0,0
63,94598,Yes,Analysing Urban Metabolism and Ecological Footprint - A Multi-Scale Approach to Urban Sustainability Accounting and its Policy Implications,"Today, at the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of the world’s population are living in urban areas, generating significant pressure on the supporting ecosystems. As the available means (i.e., financial and political) to change urban activities, design and lifestyle are limited, it is imperative to identify those sectors and activities with the potential to contribute the most to minimising the urban environmental load and increasing sustainability. Two approaches that are being used to quantify and assess urban sustainability are “urban metabolism” and “ecological footprint analysis”. However, these approaches need to be further developed to better reflect the complexity and unique characteristics of specific urban areas and activities. In the proposed research, I will develop a multi-scale analysis of the urban metabolism and footprint. By combining the above two approaches, I will identify the specific urban activities that contribute the most to urban throughput and will illustrate the gap to sustainability. By uniquely combining top-down (i.e., using secondary data sources) and bottom-up (i.e., surveys and focus groups) data gathering methods, this project will breakdown the studied urban activities into their specific components at the household to the city scales. By combining quantitative and qualitative approaches this research will be able to examine existing and suggested measures (e.g., policies, technologies) and to inform decision makers as to the required directions. This interdisciplinary research will combine data from the social and natural sciences with engineering. It is expected to contribute to the emerging fields of environmental accounting and sustainability sciences as well as to urban and regional planning and public policy. It has the potential to serve as a basis for other urban sustainability studies in Europe and for future collaboration and mutual fertilization with other researchers in the ERA.",1,1
152,87420,Yes,"Quantifying and modelling pathways of soil organic matter as affected by abiotic factors, microbial dynamics, and transport processes","Soils play a critical role in the coupled carbon-cycle climate system. However, our scientific understanding of the role of soil biological-physicochemical interactions and of vertical transport for biogeochemical cycles is still limited. Moreover the representation of soil processes in current biosphere models operating at global scale is crude compared to vegetation processes like photosynthesis. Hence, the general aim of this project is to improve our understanding of the key interactions between the biological and the physicochemical components of the soil system that are often not explicitly considered in current experimental and modeling approaches. However, these interactions are likely to influence the biogeochemical cycles for a large part of the terrestrial biosphere and thus have the potential to significantly impact the Earth System as a whole. This will be achieved through an approach that integrates new soil mesocosm experiments, field data from ongoing European projects and soil process modeling. In mesocosm tracer experiments the fate of new and autochthonous soil organic matter will be followed under varying temperature and moisture regimes, explicitly investigating the role of microbiota. This project will test the hypothesis that transfer coefficients between soil organic matter pools, respiration and microbial biomass formation are constant as implemented in current soil organic matter models. Novel soil model structures will be developed that may explicitly account for the role of microbes and transport for soil organic matter dynamics. This will be supported by multiple-constraint model identification techniques, which allows testing and achieving model consistency with several observation types and theory. The soil modules will be incorporated into global terrestrial biosphere models which are coupled and uncoupled to the atmosphere allowing specific model experiments for investigating feedback mechanisms between soil, climate, and vegetation.",1,1
498,36433,No,Integrated Approach for Fatigue Design of Low Weight Vehicle Suspension Components,"The release of every new design of automotive products requires extensive durability assessment processes to guarantee safety and performance over the entire life of the vehicle. This process is mainly carried out experimentally and has traditionally major disadvantages such as large costs, long durations and a requirement for a large number of prototypes. CAE tools have been introduced in the design process in order to make durability predictions before prototyping.   However the poor quality of such fatigue life predictions for the mechanical components and the difficult and time consuming use of the tools are still critical factors which prevent systematic applications in the design processes and the achievement of the full benefit in terms of time to market. The new scenario of Low Weight vehicles and the pressure from the market to cut down development costs and lead time create the need for a substantial step forward. The present project has then three general objectives:   to introduce durability predictions in the concept or early design phase of innovative vehicle suspension components   to develop integrated CAE tools for early and realistic (robust vs manufacturing) co design with the suppliers .   to design simplified and accelerated tests on components through the use of CA analysis tools.   The technical objectives and the related developments of this proposal are the following:   to improve the state of art quality of CAE prediction by :   selection and validation of multi axial FLP criteria spot weld FE modelling and validation material data base including the effects of manufacturing on fatigue properties   to increase CAE tools integration creation of user interfaces (MB to FEM to FLP)   to improve the efficiency of durability assessments under complex multi axial load conditions by : strategies for synthesizing load histories (input for testing & numerical simulations) strategies for reducing FEM stress analysis output (focus on critical areas) to design simplified and accelerated fatigue tests on isolated components, through CA analysis, by determination and validation of appropriate boundary conditions   to demonstrate the feasibility of the integrated procedure and the related benefits on real case studies by multiobjective  (weight,fatigue life,..) design optimizations of components.  In order to compare the results obtained by different end users, a common mission profile will be defined and used as a reference for the fatigue life assessments within the project.   The final results will be a prototype SW package allowing the designer to run a complete and integrated numerical fatigue assessment of a suspension component, case studies producing Optimised demonstrators of suspension components aiming at 20% weight reductions, and finally simplified fatigue test procedures on the isolated components aiming at shortening the testing durations by a target factor of 10. The consortium comprises two car manufacturers, with complementary expertise and products, strongly committed with the development of innovative vehicles that will act as final users and validators respectively for the applications on thin shell and spotwelded components, an industrial R&TD center with consolidated technical and scientific experience in fatigue field that will act as developer of the engineering methodologies and validator on cast and forged applications, two suppliers of automotive components that will contribute with prototypes and technological expertise, two vendors of specific commercial engineering tools that will implement and integrate the methods into prototype Sw and finally two research institutions providing scientific support to the development of the spot weld models and the multi axial FLP criteria respectively.",0,0
618,30489,No,High bitrate 1300 nm upgrade of the European standard single-mode fibre network,"UPGRADE aims to increase the capacity of the existing European Communications network, showing an evolutionary path from the networks of today to the pan-European network of tomorrow. The project plans to demonstrate that the present infrastructure, namely standard single mode fibre (SSMF), can be upgraded to carry high bit-rates by using optical soliton pulses at a wavelength of 1300 nm. From the experiences of the project a scenario will be developed for the upgrading of SSMF links in the 1300 nm wavelength region. To date the project has characterised some 16,000 km of standard SMF. The in-depth analysis of the capabilities of optical soliton transmission in the European network based upon this statistical database will provide a valuable tool for consideration in the mapping of the European communications backbone of the future. The first field test planned between Kassel and the Hannover CeBIT will take place this year. This will be an all-optically amplified system as indicated in the schematic. As well as the semiconductor optical amplifiers, the project has developed a new DFB laser with internal modulator for RZ signal generation as well as 10 Gbit/s SDH-compatible terminal units. The optical amplifiers are housed in specially design repeater modules which include all monitoring functions and the necessary software for integration with the management network. A photo of one of the repeater modules is shown below. With the planned field trials, UPGRADE, will demonstrate in a most convincing way, in the eyes of the public, that a transparent European Communications Backbone is a viable goal which can be achieved. The requirements of operational field trials impose stringent specifications on the new optoelectronic components being developed within the project. This accelerated development will help in finding ways to speed up time-to-market. The concurrent development of management schemes for new all-optical components will assist in the introduction of these devices into present infrastructures. By advocating time domain multiplexing in the optical domain UPGRADE will demonstrate that there is a viable alternative to the deployment of WDM thus offering network operators a choice of development scenarios. Expected Impact Demonstration of a scenario for upgrading SSMF links will open the possibility for a longer term operation of more then 90 million km of SSMF already deployed. A scenario for upgrading SSMF links at 1300 nm will complement alternative 1550 nm high-capacity options. The possibility of long links (> 1000 km) will enable network operators to develop new architectures offering simplification, ease of use, ease of management, reduced maintenance and improved cost efficiency. With an expected 15 million visitors at the EXPO, the UPGRADE link will demonstrate the advantages of co-operation throughout Europe in advancing the development of the pan-European telecommunications network. Links to other projects developing similar management schemes should result in a harmonisation in TMN for high-speed networking across participating ACTS projects.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Implemented optical soliton transmission at 1300 nm on standard single mode fibre (SSMF) Contribution to the programme Upgraded and extended life of existing single mode fibre networks Technical Approach To allow long haul transmission and high speeds, the consortium has chosen to implement optical soliton transmission at 1300 nm on SSMF. At 1550 nm, increased transmission speeds are hampered by the high group velocity dispersion (GVD) of SSMF, and soliton techniques in this window are limited by the typical European passive link spacing of 30-50 km. By contrast soliton techniques at 1300 nm benefit considerably from lower GVD where, in principle, a transmission capacity, similar to soliton systems on dispersion shifted fibre (DSF) at 1550 nm, can be achieved with a significantly reduced power budget, while still using SSMF. The higher attenuation at 1300 nm does not hinder this approach. Soliton generation will be achieved using conventional diode laser technologies combined with new modulators and switches. Optical transmission will use new semi-conductor laser amplifiers capable of >30 dB fibre-to-fibre gain. Control of the soliton signal will be studied, and active filtering techniques will be developed and implemented as necessary. All-optical multiplexers and demultiplexers, optical clock recovery and in line add/drop will be studied. These components are essential for evolution to higher bit rates where electronic signal processing is at best extremely difficult. An important criterion is that it should be possible to implement the developed components in InP to produce rudimentary ICs. The consortium will also develop a compatible TMN system for the operational network elements. Summary of Trials 10 Gbit/s over 210 km in the network of Deutsche Telekom. This link will be used for live transmission during the 1997 CeBIT exhibition. 10 Gbit/s, 2 x 800 km fully-managed link between Madrid and Lisbon for demonstration at the 1998 EXPO. National Hosts will create a user interface so that the system may be loaded with applications. Collaboration of other ACTS projects in the trial is encouraged. 40 Gbit/s TDM laboratory link over 200 km using all-optical components developed in UPGRADE. Key Issues The following are critical to the success of UPGRADE. Development of key optoelectronic components for integration into the UPGRADE system. Provision of understanding of optical soliton transmission in an operational network. Development of all-optical functions for use where electronic implementation is not possible. Adaptation of firmware and hardware specific to RZ optical soliton transmission. Encouragement of other projects to participate in demonstrations using the UPGRADE platform.",0,0

520,35043,No,Multimedia Services Integration Chain in Advanced Networks,"MUSICIAN's goal is to develop and launch attractive multimedia services which effectively combine the potential of new technologies with the wealth of material created for broadcasting purposes. It will address all aspects of the multimedia service creation and delivery chain starting with contents creation and finishing with the evaluation of the services by end-users. It will not look at the different entities in isolation but consider the interfaces between them in order to allow for a smooth transition process. During the first four months of MUSICIAN's existence the main effort has been spent on the content and service parts of the multimedia chain. The two content partners WDR and ORF developed concepts for attractive multimedia services. Also, a first service provisioning approach had been defined. From a technology perspective the project concentrated on the specification of the network architecture including CATV management. In addition, requirements were defined for the end-user devices to be utilised for delivering content to customers. MUSICIAN is expected to provide results in all areas of the multimedia services integration chain (content creation, service creation, service provisioning, network provision and customer acceptance). However, the main focus is the evaluation of the overall approach and not so much the individual components. Expected impact MUSICIAN is a concrete step towards the realisation of the European Information Society. It will provide residential users in a specific 'Tele-region' with easy access to multimedia service offers an will therefore contribute to an improved quality of life. It will add to the overall attractiveness of the region in terms of its economic competitiveness, i.e. advanced network infrastructure, know-how acquisition in the field of future technology and knowledge transfer to other companies wishing to join the multimedia market as contents or service providers. In summary, it will stimulate the market for communication technologies and hence strengthen the competitiveness of this branch of Europe's industry. Technical Approach MUSICIAN will analyse the content creation process in order to determine necessary tools and procedures for making broadcast contents available for multimedia on-line services. It will establish a service creation centre and constitute all steps necessary for service provisioning. The adaptation of existing optical fibre and coax networks will be studied for the purpose of creating advanced multimedia service delivery and access networks. Last but not least residential customers will be offered MUSICIAN services under conditions which are as realistic as possible. The evaluation of the whole chain will provide the basis for determining the viability of such a multimedia service provisioning approach. Summary of trial The project's validation of the multimedia service integration chain will take place in a large scale user trial called InfoCity NRW. All entities of the service delivery chain will be represented: content and service creators, service and network providers as well as consumers in their role as end-users. The participation of the latter is necessary to have a basis for assessing the cost-effectiveness of the service creation process. It cannot be commercially viable to design a service nobody wants. Also, customer feedback is necessary to decide which service features are important and which are dispensable. MUSICIAN is not a feasibility study but a fully fledged field trial with 10,000 households in a specific region to provide a sound statistical basis for service use. Key issues The evaluation of the whole multimedia services integration chain within the context of the InfoCity pilot test is a core feature of the project.

Are the chosen solutions economically feasible? Do consumers want such services and are they willing to pay for them?",0,0
172,87767,Yes,Joining ecophysiological Understanding and global ecosystem modelling for improved simulation of Land surface Interactions with the Atmosphere,"A thorough understanding of feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the climate system is pivotal for any climate change mitigation strategy. Such feedbacks could significantly affect and potentially accelerate climate change. Terrestrial biosphere models are increasingly coupled interactively to ocean and atmosphere models with the goal to quantify these feedbacks. However, state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models fall short of the current understanding of important ecophysiological controls of land surface processes, as evidenced by the increasing amount of ecosystem observations that have become available recently. This project aims at bridging the gap between observational science and large scale biosphere modelling by developing representations of relevant ecophysiological processes at a level of detail suitable for an Earth system model. Two of the most important fields that urgently need to be better represented will be addressed, namely the biological control of canopy conductance and plant-soil interactions. Both substantially influence land surface fluxes, ecosystem productivity and long-term carbon sequestration. The project will use innovative techniques to develop novel process representations of canopy conductance by combining different types of ecosystem observations such as eddy-covariance based flux observations and plant trait data collected by the IGBP fast track initiative on plant functional types. Novel representations of soil organic matter dynamics, including a substrate control, and plant nutrient uptake pathways will be developed and evaluated based on recent laboratory and ecosystem manipulation experiments. The improved model will be used to revise predictions of state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models for present-day and future conditions. The project will thus provide a tool to better quantify potential future interactions of the terrestrial biosphere and the climate system for the use in coupled Earth system models.",1,1
292,82964,No,Quantitative proteomics comparing human plaque phenotypes,"Vascular atherosclerotic plaque remodelling leading to rupture is responsible for about half of the total deaths in the European Union. Upon disruption of the atherosclerotic plaque, the highly trombogenic plaque content is exposed to the circulating blood leading to thrombus formation and subsequent occlusion of the artery. When plaque rupture occurs f.e. in a coronary artery this will lead to a myocardial infarction often followed by death.  The mechanisms of plaque remodelling leading to destabilization and rupture are poorly understood. Since appropriate animal models for plaque rupture are lacking, we use as a starting point a large number (~600) of well characterized carotid endarterectomy specimen from patients that are well documented and undergo a follow up. We combine this Dutch tissue bank with state of the art proteomics approaches present in Singapore.  This combination will use the classical approach to screen for proteins that differ between stable fibrous and unstable inflammatory plaques and between stable and ruptured plaque (Objective 1). Next to this approach, we will screen for proteins that differ between for proteins that differ between patients that had a cardiovascular event and control patients, an approach that can redefine the definition of the vulnerable plaque (Objective 2). The differential expression of the proteins will be validated in a large population allowing correction for confounding (Objective 3).  After the proteomics approach and return to the Netherlands, we will investigate t he role of the differentially expressed proteins as a blood marker and its function. The research performed in the frame of this project will increase the global understanding of atherosclerosis and largely impact the overall management of this pathology as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers.",0,0
456,210818,No,Social Distress Response in the Context of Empathy in Rats,"'Why do humans behave pro-socially to such an extent that it supports the life of other individuals? Similarly, why do certain people harm others by hurting and sometimes killing? Finally, how can we promote pro-sociality and limit harmful actions? The philosopher and economist Adam Smith considered that what motivates us to help a person is that we can “place ourselves in his situation, we conceive ourselves enduring all the same torments', thus, holding empathy as the driving force of prosociality.   Human neuroimaging studies show that two brain structures, the anterior insula (AI) and the rostral cingulate cortex (rCC), are involved in empathy. Yet, it remains unknown whether these structures are involved in consequent behaviors, i.e., helping or hurting others. With this fellowship, I intend to fill this gap: I propose an approach to causally test Adam Smith's theory, which will produce findings of tangible societal benefits by informing populations worldwide whether prosocial programs can limit fighting and bullying, and by providing novel pharmacological targets for the treatment anti-social disorders.   Because human neuroimaging is severely limited in its ability to establish causal links between brain activity and behavior, we will use a rat model to study empathy-driven prosociality. Considering that a suited rodent model is completely lacking in the field, we will develop a paradigm where actor rats choose between two levers; while both yield the same reward, one requires more effort to be activated. Once preference for the easy lever has been quantified, it will be paired with an electric shock delivered to another rat. The impact of social distress on the actor's choice will provide a way to study prosocial and aggressive behavior. In a second time, we will deactivate the rCC and AI in order to causally explore the role of each structure in prosociality. Finally, we will use calcium-imaging to map and characterize the neural networks involved.'",0,0
481,222794,No,Development of an in silico model for prediction of in vivo human bone fracture healing using micro-finite element analysis,"Current knowledge of fracture healing is based on experimental animal studies of diaphyseal bone, despite 20% of fractures occurring in the metaphysis of the distal forearm. Moreover, current fracture healing assessment tools lack the resolution to identify and isolate the initial fracture site in cases involving a crushing fracture.   The objectives of this project are to (1) develop a micro-finite element (μFE) model for fracture site identification, (2) develop an in silico model for human bone fracture healing capable of tracking local microstructural changes, and (3) test the predictive power of the in silico model using clinical data. μFE models will be generated from high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HRpQCT) data of the distal radius from wrist fracture patients. The μFE models will be generated from HRpQCT data collected at the early stages of fracture healing and compared to remodelling maps in order to determine if μFE models can be used to isolate the site of the initial fracture. Adaptations will be made to an existing in silico model based on the findings of the μFE analysis. The resulting in silico model will be applied to clinical HRpQCT data to predict endpoint microstructural changes as well as patterns in fracture healing and remodelling. The predictive power of this in silico model will be determined by comparing the simulation results to observed behavior in vivo.   The proposed project merges recent advances in bone mechanobiology, μFE simulations, and medical imaging to develop novel image analysis and registration methods as well as a tool for predicting if, when, and where fracture healing will occur. The proposed work will provide insights into the local behavior of trabecular bone fracture healing and help the fellow achieve professional maturity. Further, the in silico model has the potential to change the landscape of fracture healing research, particularly in areas of preclinical testing and personalized medicine.",0,0
138,26935,Yes,Ecology and sustainable semi-natural management of indigenous forests in Central South-East Asia,"In the context of the rapidly decreasing forest areas of Central SouthEast Asia and the associated social and environmental problems, the project aims at improving the understanding of the ecology, structure and dynamics of indigenous forests and their successional trends and of their sustainable silvicultural management on a semi-natural basis - under aspects of economic efficiency as well as social acceptability and environmental stability. Until now, very little research has been conducted into the natural forest of the region. Ecology and silviculture are poorly understood and their potential underestimated.  To this end the objectives include research into underlying ecological processes of natural and secondary forests, silvicultural management techniques for natural and secondary forests and Eor reforestation with native species, socio economic impact analysis of semi-natural management, and the interaction of these factors.  The protected areas and the surrounding buffer zones of the Thung Yai Huai Kha Khaeng UNESCO World Heritage Site in Thailand will serve as study sites. Here, the main evergreen as well as decidous forests and vegetative types of Continental South-East Asia are represented and the results gained can be directly applied in the buffer Zone management.  The project will initially last for 4 Years, commencing in 1994. It is carried out as an institutional venture of three universities. The envisaged cooperation will benefit the research institutions involved through improved research capacities, information exchange, and the complementary eefects of an interdisciplinary approach. The prospect of lonq term cooperation and an associated continuity of personal contacts will give the research work additional thrust, making the project a comprehensive approach to the semi-natural management of natural and secondary forests in Thailand and Central South-East Asia. Both in terms of research topics and in point of time within forest successions the results can be extrapolated to other forest areas of CSEA.",1,1
219,52882,Yes,Integrated assessment tools to gauge local functional status within freshwater ecosystems,"Problems to be solved Biological monitoring of river ecosystems within Europe is based almost entirely on measures of community structure and ignores functional aspects of the systems being studied. However, rivers are managed in order to maintain essential 'ecosystem services', which are dependent on the functional integrity of the system. It is surprising, that complementary measures for assessing ecosystem function have yet to be developed. This project aims to redress the balance by developing an integrated set of tools that can be used to aid management-decision making by supplying information on the state of ecological processes that maintain key ecosystem services, and by providing a reference database that can be used to inform the setting of ecological quality targets. Scientific objectives and approach Tools development will reflect species functionally representative of the 3 ecoregions studied (in Portugal, The Netherlands and the UK). Two types of bioassay will be employed: (i) measures of energy supply (i.e. primary production, detritus processing); (ii) measures of energy consumption and transfer (i.e. algal (periphyton and phytoplankton) grazing and detritivore (shredder and collector) feeding). Methods will be adapted for in site deployment. Individual-based models (e.g. dynamic energy budget models) will be used to project the consequences of short-term changes in feeding rate measured in site bioassays for individual vital rates. Two types of model systems, representing high flow conditions, and low-flow conditions, will be used to validate in site tools. Two training courses will be organised, so that all partners can be instructed in the application of the developed tools. The tools will initially be tested in the absence of contaminants. Four reference compounds will be tested in each system using a regression design. Seasonal deployment of in site tests will be performed at least twice at selected sites to gain insight into temporal variability in response. Environmental information will be collected for each site. Data will be stored in a standard database format. Univariate and multivariate techniques will be used to characterise reference conditions for each tool and investigate relationships between site-specific environmental factors and response. A suite of in site tests will be deployed at each of a series of impacted sites, degraded by inputs from agricultural, mining, industrial and urban activities. A network of local steering groups will be established, consisting of water managers, from local, regional and/or national organisations; members will participate in the selection of sampling sites and will contribute to the project by supplying data (i.e. recent monitoring data) and expert knowledge on sampling sites. An interactive project internet site will be developed, with an open access area, to communicate project objectives and results to the public, and a restricted access area, password-protected front-end, to allow access to the database of information collected. At the end an Ecological Quality Manual, will be CD-ROM produced, to encourage the use of the bioassay techniques developed here. Expected impacts TARGET cuts across many inter-linked Community social objectives, from the preservation of environmental quality through protection of biodiversity and wildlife habitat and the sustainable and wise use of freshwater ecosystems, to the clear social and economic benefits, to the public and to the chemical industries involved, that may result from the use of functionally-based monitoring schemes. This will contribute to an overall improvement in the quality of life. The loss of biodiversity within Europe arises mainly from changes in traditional land use, habitat fragmentation by industrial infrastructure, urbanisation and exposure to mass tourism, misuse of chemical risk assessment programs and inappropriate monitoring tools. Since freshwater systems are currently managed in order to maintain essential 'ecosystem services' that are dependent on the maintenance of functional integrity, monitoring tools are often based upon structural information alone. By explicitly linking the degree of impairment of an ecosystem to potential effects on the long-term sustainability of key ecosystem functions, sustainable use of freshwaters is appropriately addressed for the first time. Thus, the research output of TARGET will contribute to the preservation of environmental quality, enabling improved assessment of conservation requirements at local and national scale, meeting management needs and informing action from legislation at European scale to practical considerations at the stakeholder level. Scientific achievements: Key processes influencing the economy and hence sustainability of running waters are detritus processing, detritivore feeding rates, algal production and grazer feeding rates. Thus in any assessment of the functioning of rivers, it is vital to incorporate these elements. TARGET focused on energy supply and transfer processes in running waters. During TARGET several techniques have been developed and/or refined, and SOPs (for both culture methods and in situ bioassays) were produced for: shredders -amphipods (Gammarus pulex, Echinogammarus. meridionalis and Atyaephyra desmaresti), cased-caddis (Sericostoma personatum, Calamoceras marsupus)-, column grazers (D. magna), collectors (Chironomus riparius), benthic grazers (Lymnaea peregra), primary production (immobilised algae), and detritus processing (leaf pack method). In situ bioassays were seasonally deployed at both reference and contaminated, across different ecoregions. Mathematical models were produced for species from four different functional levels: shredder (G. pulex), column grazer (D. magna), benthic grazer (L. peregra) and collector (C. riparius). These mathematical models are basic tools that share the same conceptual approach of internal resource partitioning.  Outputs from simulations allow the user to perform life table analysis for each species and infer the levels of functional impairment of an ecosystem. In addition to the bioassay data, characterization of all deployments, from reference and contaminated sites, included water chemistry, habitat and geographical information and invertebrate community structure. All this information was entered into the on-line database, developed by the project, and used later for numerical analysis. The database information was structured and organised as a set of relational databases. General location parameters including geographical characterization are grouped together. In all databases information can be selectively extracted and exported for further analysis and manipulation with appropriate statistical packages. Results indicate that the distribution of the bioassay values follows closely the distribution of the bmwp/aspt scores, that some sampling sites were erroneously classified as reference or impacted sites and, more importantly, that the use of some bioassays is potentially applicable to assess the ecological status of freshwaters (see also below).  In conclusion: Despite the existence of wide variability in response of the bioassays, results were consistent within deployments and across sites clear patterns of impairment of ecosystem function were observed. Some of the bioassays employed proved to discriminate between reference and contaminated sites, or even between different eco-regions, particularly the bioassays assessing the following functional groups: column grazer (i.e. Daphnia bioassays), shredder (i.e. amphipod bioassays) and, although less evident due to the fact that this type of bioassays was not used in all cases, to the benthic grazer (i.e. Chironomus bioassays). The gradient associated with the bioassays response follows the gradients of the BMWP/BMWP' and ASPT/ASPT' scores. Although requiring technical training bioassays do not require taxonomic expertise, such as the one required to use BMWP/BMWP' and ASPT/ASPT' scores. Moreover, bioassays can and should be conducted with native species maintained in the laboratory or collected from field sites known to be clean, thus increasing the ecological relevance of the bioassays. This is a major advantage for the potential future implementation of the developed tools to assess the ecological status of freshwaters.",1,1
742,17280,No,STARTUP-COMNET,"The STARTUP-COMNET programme aims at a special involvement in the DELTA Programme of professional producers of multimedia materials, both in the technological aspects (uses of new technologies for education and training are for the most part still to be discovered), and in the pedagogical aspects (the excellence of the technology cannot answer for the lack of knowledge in the field of pedagogy).  A database has been compiled containing detailed information on 731 European producers of technology based learning materials. A symposium of 100 participants resulted in the production of reports on pedagogy, technology and market requirements, and 70 in depth interviews with learning materials producers have been carried out.  The STARTUP-COMNET programme, proposed by a consortium of educational and training multimedia materials professional producers and an International association of users aims at promoting at ELTA in order to stimulate the European market in this field.   It relies on three linked strategic actions: an organizational action, an informational action and an operational action.   The justification for the proposed actions is the need, felt by the producers to build a network of privileged relationships in order to share available resources and work towards a common strategic European market.   A process of concertation, negotiation and harmonisation needs to be undertaken with the users. Direct recommendations for suppliers are expected to be emerging and taken up by contractors. The identification of common users needs will improve the acceptance of the developed learning material and create favourable conditions for its dissemination.   Organisational Action: a) bringing together all the European professional producers into a supportive network on the basis of their common interests; b) allowing the network partners to share expertise and information on new developments on field of educational technology c) setting up a representative task force to provide information, from the producers point of view, to the DELTA Programme working teams.

539,46110,No,Simple sequence repeats - ssrs - in relation to adaptation in wild barley,"Research objectives and content  This is an exciting and innovative project in which I have the opportunity to extend my training and knowledge in the application of molecular markers to the genetics of plant adaptation. The ability of simple sequence repeats to open up genomes has revolutionised research in human and mammalian genetics and will have considerable impact in the plant sciences. This project aims to exploit the recent development of SSRs in barley, to select a set of SSRs which show even genome coverage, and to apply these in genetic characterisation of a set of wild barley populations, for which between and within ecogeographic data are available. The aim being to find markers for genes associated with adaptation, and to examine whether SSRs are biologically neutral. A comparison of synteny between wild and cultivated barley responses to stress will be carried out by experimental testing of barley doubled haploid populations derived from cultivated/cultivated, cultivated/wild and wild/tild crotses. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  I will receive training in the development, mapping and hands-on analyses of SSRs. Experimental data will be analysed using various statistical programmes for which formal training is given this will involve analysis of variance and regression, principal co-ordinates and principal components. Appropriate programmes will be used for genetic mapping of SSRs and mapping phenotypic/quantitative trait loci data. I will receive training in hydroponics and cold chamber experiments in examining various physiological responses to imposed stresses. I will produce a doubled haploid population from a wild barley/wild barley cross using the recent published isolated barley microspore protocol. I will be working in a multi-disciplinary team in a lively, active and exciting department. The results of this research training project will be prepared and submitted by me as a doctoral thesis.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  The development of SSRs at the SCRI, and other EU partners, is geared towards improving the efficiency of breeding barley for malting quality and disease resistance. Genetic markers for abiotic stress tolerance are also being developed for application in barley improvement programmes. In addition to marker assisted selection, accelerated breeding programmes rely on the rapid production of homozygous lines for which microspore culture is a key emerging technology. Microspore culture is also seen as being a major target for cereal transformation since plants can be regenerated directly from single cultured (transformed) cells. I will therefore receive training in areas pertinent to modern plant biotechnological industries.",0,0
704,51010,No,IMPROVING DRILLING EFFICIENCY THROUGH REAL-TIME DYNAMICS CONTROL,"In many cases the economics of drilling suffer from a non-optimized adjustement of drilling parameters. Rate of penetration can not be maximized due to the lack of direct information on the drilling process. Complex well geometries often cause a destruction of the drilling BHA because of severe vibrations and the like. The aim of this project is to introduce an innovative instrument for down-hole real-time measurement of drilling parameters, especially dynamics. Demonstration in drilling operation should prove both the tool's integrity and functionality as well as the economic benefits of the new technology. The new measuring instrumentation shall establish a closed information loop between the down-hole drilling process and the surface drilling supervisor. Since effective drilling parameters will be fully under control, the whole process can be optimized by adjusting the drilling regime as required for highest penetration rate and long-term durability of BHA members. Thereby the drilling costs for the operating company as well as the impact on the environment in terms of time of drilling can be substantially reduced.L% Considerable enhancements made to the design of the pilot series tool, providing more and more useful measurements. Additionally the process of memory dump was strikingly improved, thereby adding to the user's acceptance of the CoPilot service. Surface system field verification has been completed by means of real well tests with CoPilot prototype tools. The Drilling Efficiency service will provide real-time display of down-hole drilling characteristics on the rig floor. This will allow the driller to take corrective measures to optimize drilling parameters and to reduce the occurence of undesired drilling phenomena. After the well has been drilled, the customer will be provided with a log plot (and digital record) that can be used both for the post-well analysis of the drilled well, and in the pre-well planning of a future well. The Drilling Efficiency system will also record down-hole drilling forces and motions that improve the understanding of the down-hole drilling environment. The new service will utilize high frequency data from a variety of down-hole sensors including weight-on-bit, torque and bending moment strain gauges, magnetometers, axial and lateral accelerometers and internal and annular pressure sensors. Algorithms embedded in the down-hole tool will process sensor data, compare the actual outputs to pre-determined benchmark values and communicate any variances as a measure of drilling conditions. The information will be presented in real-time, on the rig floor, to enable the driller to take any corrective action. down-hole data will be combined with data from surface sensors to provide further indications of drilling conditions. In addition to real-time information, the Drilling Efficiency service will provide averaged statistical and severity level memory data. Down-hole software requirements are those inherent to providing Drilling Efficiency service, e.g. statistical processing, flagging of drilling diagnostics (severity levels) and tool diagnostics. Diagnostics are tool status logic and data which, in real-time and in memory, inform the user of tool health.

It covers both ends of the scale relevant for food production, viz., precision farming and the perspective of a sustainable agriculture in the context of integrated agri-environment management. It aims at developing innovative and new farm capacities that help the intensive farm sector optimize their external input (nutrients, water) management and use, with the vision of bridging sustainable crop production with fair economic competitiveness.  Our comprehensive strategy covers five interconnected levels: a modular technology package (based on the integration of Earth observation and wireless sensor networks into a webGIS), a field work package (exploring options of improving soil and input management), a toolset for multi-actor participatory processes, an integrated multi-scale economic analysis framework, and an umbrella policy analysis set based on indicator-, accounting- and footprint approach.

However, the species of this family are notoriously difficult to identify because of the great variability within the species and the ease with which they hybridise. At present there is no univ ersally accepted classification of Salicaceae s.str.  The project will characterise both genera, Salix L. and Populus L., of Salicaceae s.str. comprising about 620 species worldwide. It will result in the creation of a comprehensive database of characters, taxonomically validated names, synonyms, bibliographic details, geographical distribution, illustrations and taxonomic comments. On the basis of this database, a checklist will be created and published as a book and on the Internet. An interactive key will also be made available on the Internet. Using the collected morphological data, a worldwide classification system will be constructed, for the first time, for these two genera.  This classification will be combined with the results of a molecular genetic analysis of the species using both plastid and nuclear genetic markers, which will also establish phylogenetic relationships within these two genera. In doing so, DNA from species acquired from the field and from contacts and herbaria around the world, will be added to the DNA bank at the host institution. The project will combine one of the most experienced systematic botanists specialising in the family Salicaceae s.str. with one of the foremost botanical collections and laboratories in the world, to create a definitive classification of an economically important group of plants.

To reach the ambitious aims, it is necessary to improve the energy performance of buildings in operation. Embodied energy in materials presents a high percentage of the energy spent in the whole life cycle of a building, so new materials are needed.  Therefore we will develop within this project a novel material solution for ultra-efficient solar energy harvesting and heat exchange through an active building envelope. We thereby address the two technical applications of windows and facades, into which we will implement LARGE AREA FLUIDIC WINDOWS (LaWin). LaWin represents the vision of large-area microfluidic windows and facade elements which are based on four types of new materials: low-cost thin and strong cover glasses, microstructured rolled glasses of architectural quality, a glass-glass compound comprising microfluidic channels and a heat storage liquid designed for transparency and/or active functionality in facade and window implementation. LaWin devices will be designed to build on existing platforms and geometries used in triple glazing and facade elements to enable rapid market access and acceptance. Expected impacts: - Reduction of embodied energy and CO2 to 0 for window surfaces after four months of using (possible because of using regenerative energy with windows for climatisation of buildings, high insulation) - Reduction of at least 123 000 t CO2 per year for heating (goal: at least 2% of window furnaces in Europe) - Improving thermal insulation figures for window surfaces by at least 20% - Reduction of total costs-Purchase price is higher, but running costs are really low  - Demonstration of at least a 10% reduction of the energy spent during the whole life cycle of a building; - strengthen competitiveness for all project partners  - Clear and transparent information to facilitate better decision making - High quality and environmentally friendly alternative for the build",0,0
781,211814,No,New Nuclear Medicine Imaging Radiotracer 64Cu(II) for diagnosing Hypoxia Conditions Based on the Cellular Copper Cycle,"Imaging of hypoxia is important in many disease states in oncology, cardiology, and neurology. Hypoxia is a common condition encountered within the tumour microenvironment that drives proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy. Despite on-going efforts to identify hypoxia, until now there is no clinically approved imaging biomarker, due to both low tumour uptake, and a low signal to background (S/B) ratio that affects the imaging quality. Nuclear Medicine is using labelled radio-isotopes for PET/CT and SPECT imaging. These radio-tracers diagnose the metabolic processes in the body. Among these tracers, 18F-FDG is the most routinely used as a marker of glucose metabolism. However, not all tumours consume glucose, and glucose consumption is not specific only for malignant tumours, which limits its application. Copper is a nutritional metal, recently examined as a radiotracer for hypoxia, owing to its to the oxidising environment. Clinical and in-vivo studies on various 64Cu(II)-PET radiotracers resulted in controversial reports on the specificity of the current tracers for hypoxia imaging due to non-selective bio-distribution & low S/B ratio. This multidisciplinary proposal focuses on the discovery of comprehensive signal pathways of the cellular copper cycle using advanced biophysical methods and a proprietary design of 64Cu(II) radiotracer. This radiotracer will be incorporated in the cellular copper cycle, and will enable to selectively target the oxidising environment in tumours. The design of the new radiotracer is based on systematic structural & functional mapping of the copper binding sites to the various copper proteins and the visualisation of the transfer mechanism. This new copper tracer should increase the selectivity of tumour uptake, stability, and improve bio-distribution. This project assimilates cold and hot chemistry and biology, while emphasising the clinical unmet need in metal based radiotracer that form stable complexes.",0,0
569,37775,No,Structure of free and complexed IF2 and search for a new target for anti-microbial drugs,"The discovery of new anti-microbial agents has become a problem of crucial importance in light of the acquired resistance of many pathogens to most of the available antibiotics. The new industrial trend in antibacterial R&D is focused on the high through-put screening of select, appropriately chosen, broad spectrum macromolecular targets. In the present programme, we plan to develop a new class of antibiotics directed against bacterial translation initiation factor IF2 or interfering with the interaction of this protein with its main ligand initiator fMet-tRNA, which, unlike elongator tRNAs, is not present in eukaryotes. In fact, IF2 and the IF2-fMet-tRNA complex are endowed with all the properties required by an ideal target for rational drug design. High through-put screening tests will be applied in the search for both natural and synthetic compounds interfering with the various functions of IF2. The positive hits will be subjected to secondary screens and the most promising compounds will be improved by combinatorial chemistry and rational drug design based on the target's 3D structure which, in the meantime, will be elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Indeed, one of the main aims of this proposal is to characterize the 3D structure of initiation factor IF2, both free and in complex with its ligands (fMet-tRNA and guanosine nucleotides); more precisely, we envisage the elucidation of both crystal and solution structure of the two domains which contain all the IF2 activities required for translation (i.e. the central G-domain containing GTP binding site, GTPase catalytic center, 30S and 50S binding sites and the C-terminal domain containing the fMet-tRNA binding site). The perspectives for elucidation of the 3D structure of IF2, both alone and complexed with some of its ligands, are good. In fact, important progress in this direction has been made recently with the production of co-crystals of Bacillus stearothermophilus IF2 C-domain-fMet-tRNA complex and of good quality crystals of the G-C-domains. The former crystals diffract with close to 3.0 A resolution and native diffraction data sets as well as different heavy atom derivatives enabling phase determination by different techniques are already available. Furthermore, good quality 2D NMR spectra of 15N-labeled IF2 C-domain have been obtained and a promising screening test to select for IF2 mutants defective in fMet-tRNA binding has been worked out. An important aspect of our proposal is that it places a great emphasis on the study of RNA-protein interaction, a topic about which relatively little is known compared to protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The results obtained will not only enable us to clarify the molecular nature and the spatial organization of the active sites of IF2, thus enabling us to shed more light on the mechanism and regulation of translation initiation, but will also contribute a better understanding of the architecture and mode of action of the important superfamily of G-proteins of which IF2 is a member.",0,0
639,48037,No,Oxidative attack by necrotophic pathogens new approaches for an innovative and non-biocidal control of plant diseases,"This research collaboration aims at creating the knowledge basis for a significant innovation in protecting plants from fungal diseases.   Currently, the control of fungal diseases in all major crops is based on fungicides possessing biocidal activity against the target organism(s). A reduction in the use of such biocidal plant protectants can be achieved by two strategies:  I) improvement of plant resistance by plant breeders, or  2) interference with specific fungal pathogenicity factor(s), which are responsible for fungal aggressiveness and infection.   The second strategy requires a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of the infection mechanism. We have located severe gaps in the science of plant pathology and plant protection concerning the 'attack weapons' of the very important necrotrophic pathogens. Necrotrophs need to kill the plant tissue before invading and colonising it. The process of killing (necrotisation) is the crucial step that determines the success of infection. For several economically important pathogens such as the grey mould fungus, Botrytis cinerea, the necrotising factors are not known. B. cinerea causes severe losses in a wide range of crops such as rapeseed, sunflower, beans, cabbage, onions, lettuce, strawberries, ornamentals, grapevine and it also represents a post-harvest problem of many fruits.   The threat imposed by this fungus requires the intense and constant use of fungicides in many of these crops. This research proposal builds on the recent discovery that oxidative forces are involved when B. cinerea infects the plant. We demonstrated that aggressive infections trigger an early 'oxidative burst' in the infected plant cells which leads to rapid host cell death and thus enables the infection. As opposed to biotrophic pathogens, which are hindered by this socalled 'hypersensitive response' (HR), infection by necrotrophs appears to benefit from this plant reaction. We have shown that aggressive 'active oxygen species'(AOS), such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals are generated in the early phases of infection but the sources and pathways of their production are completely unknown.   The processes underlying this oxidative attack are highly complex and their elucidation requires experts from the different disciplines of plant science, such as plant pathology, fungal and plant genetics, biophysics and biochemistry.   We have gathered a group of eminent scientists from Europe and Israel covering these areas, who are dedicated to combine their expertise and make a significant contribution to our understanding of oxidative processes in plant diseases.   The immediate objectives, which can be achieved within this research project are   - characterising the oxidative events during infection,   - identifying sources and induction pathways of active oxygen species,   - establishing the role of the fungus and the plant in oxidative burst events   - pinpointing sites for a potential disruption of the infection process.   The long-term objectives, which can be achieved in succession to the 3-year work programme, are   - transferring the described principles of necrotrophy to other necrotrophic pathogens,   - developing novel strategies of non-biocidal disease control based on inactivated pathogenicity,   - collaborating with industrial partners to exploit the knowledge for novel disease control strategies and   - developing non-biocidal technologies of plant protection against necrotrophic pathogens.   This research proposal describes a highly innovative approach to create the basis for a durable and smooth way of protecting cultivated plants from necrotrophic pathogens. The results from this research will stimulate the producers of plant protectants to design new strategies of control which will meet even tighter environmental requirements than those existing today. Additionally, plant breeders may benefit from this research in their efforts to discover and utilise sources and markers of resistance.",0,0
299,74252,No,Advanced - Techniques for Evaluation of Sustainability Assessment Tools,"To realize progress towards the ambitions on Sustainable Development (SD) the EU and others should set wise objectives and ensure effective implementation. This requires proper policies and a consistent implementation process. To make equitable and ambitious decisions on which policies to develop and to review the progress made towards the SD goals, tools (i.e.methods, models, approaches and appraisals) are needed that support strategy development, ex ante sustainability impact assessments (Seas) as well as policy reviews. This project will assist in improving both Seas and the SD strategy definition, by high-level validation of the tools using consistent and comprehensive evaluation framework. First, a draft evaluation framework and key aspects of SD will be formulated. Then a catalogue of state of the art tools will be made and a preliminary evaluation of the tools in the context of different policy questions will be carried out based on literature reviews. In this phase the project will focus on water, climate and agriculture & land-use policy questions. Then an array of tools will be tested in one case study on agriculture& land-use. This will lead to a final evaluation framework that indicates how the tools relate, the merits of each tool, the circumstances under which they can be used, the pros and cons and the extent to which they integrate externalities of policies. Moreover, the evaluation framework will show which tools are useful for answering which key aspects of SD and will identify the trade-offs of using the different tools for addressing the three pillars of Dafter this project there will be a better insight for policy-makers and those carrying out Seas, what tools they can best use in decision-making or assessment processes, given the available resources and the desired scope of the process. This can clearly improve the quality of the decision-making or assessment process, and thus improve Seas and SD strategy definition.",0,0

81,4556,Yes,"Les espèces d'armillaria dans les forêts d'Europe: comportement, pouvoirpathogène, méthodes de lutte","Damage due to Armillaria root rot is serious in all EEC countries, particularly in plantation monocultures of conifers, fruit trees, ligneous ornamental and floral cultures. It is also found in more natural ecosystems, even deciduous forest, especially if trees have been stressed. The last decade of research has shown that in Europe there are six species of Armillaria differing in their pathogenicity, ecological and host specialisation. Two EEC research projects have for the last two years expanded such knowledge and indicated in which directions continued research is necessary.  The ultimate aim of reducing loss due to Armillaria root either by ecological, biological, genetical, or in some cases chemical control depends on a thorough understanding of this fungus.   In this project 6 contractors and 6 subcontractors propose three main topics of research: the differences between and identification of species; the pathogenicity of different species; control methods.   Characteristics of the different Armillaria species in Europe.   Differentiation of a species in the laboratory: studies will be made with a scanning electron microscope of undifferentiated mycelium. Fruiting and morphology in culture will be further investigated. An immunological test based on monoclonal antibodies will be developed.  Ecological role in the forests of southern Europe: surveys in Italy about the distribution and role of Armillaria species will be extended. The first studies of this kind will be undertaken in Greece.  Equilibrium between the different Armillaria species in nature: the equilibrium established between different Armillaria species found in proximity will be examined in different ecosystems, taking into account the effect of human intervention and other factors modulating competition among species.   Pathogenicity of the different Armillaria species in Europe.   Determinants of pathogenicity (enzymes and toxins): those enzymes (cellulases, xylanases, suberinases, pectinases and proteases) involved in the cell wall degradation of a ligneous host will be studied. Toxins (low molecular weight molecules targeting host cell protoplasm) will be extracted from pure fungal culture or dual cultures where the fungus is confronted with the host. Biotests with toxins will be performed on isolated cells and tissue cultures.  The influence of stress on pathogenicity: modifications in host susceptibility to different Armillaria species in relation to varying degrees of water stress will be studied.  Intraspecific variation in pathogenicity: comparisons will be made of isolates of A ostoyae taken from sites of natural infection where differences in pathogenicity have been observed. A miniaturised inoculation method will be developed so that the pathogenicity of such isolates (to Pinus Pinaster) can be reliably but rapidly tested.   Control methods for the different Armillaria species in Europe.   Chemical control: systemic fungicides will be screened.  Biological control: lignicolous fungi antagonistic to Armillaria species will be selected. Inoculated on old stumps they would reduce the inoculum potential of Armillaria and protect young trees.  Genetical control: conifers (especially Pinus species), deciduous trees such as Quercus, Populus and Eucalyptus, fruit trees and ligneous floral cultures will be artificially inoculated and screened for resistance.",1,1

832,208525,No,Integrated rational design of cell factories for high value compounds,"Industrial biotechnology is being increasingly considered as a means to lower the dependency on oil-derived raw-materials, increase the use of renewable resources and reduce the use of water, energy and the production of CO2 emissions in the current chemical industry. However, although generally more sustainable and environmentally friendly, bioprocesses are normally not yet economically competitive. SILICO develops rational solutions for the optimization of microbes, targeted at the robust and cost-effective production of target compounds such as bio-fuels, food ingredients, chemical building blocks or biopolymers.  After more than six year working closely with leading chemical, materials, agriculture and synthetic biology companies as a development partner to maintain their market edge in increasingly competitive markets. The main current challenge of the company and central objective of this innovation action is to move from a purely service provider company into a product provider company, working in the integrated development of bio-processes, from the in silico design of cell factories to the in vivo implementation by the company itself or in a joint-venture/partnership model.  The company expects that, with the collaboration of the Innovation Associate, an innovation strategy exploiting the design of optimized microbes to overproduce selected high value chemicals with high market potential will be defined, thus generating its own IP to be licensed out or used in joint ventures with industrial partners.

Their evolution is today still far from its objective, since the insufficient knowledge of their biology, a scarce co-ordination of research projects and the absence of integration of activities of the actors operating in different areas (research, industry, health products regulation and marketing). Therefore, the realisation of a multidisciplinary training programme, which integrates various scientific and technological approaches is necessary to address a real need of the community.

The course is expected to gather young scientists from industrial and academic institutions, coming from several EU and candidate countries. It will present training and scientific innovations: for the first time the various aspects of the development of vector technology from the bench to the industrial level will be provided to the community. Theoretical modules will be open to large public including industries and regulatory agencies, and the status of the art will be presented and discussed.

370,220919,No,Genome-wide surveys and functional analysis of pancreatic cancer metastasis drivers,"Metastasis is the major cause of death in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). International sequencing efforts on >800 human primaries gave comprehensive insights into PDAC genetics. In contrast, equivalent studies for “metastasis genetics” were not possible, largely because of a lack of metastatic tissue resources, particularly of treatment-naive ones. Another bottleneck is the scarcity of adequate experimental models recapitulating the multi-step nature of metastasis. As a consequence, the molecular basis of metastasis remains poorly understood.   We developed unique resources and tools for metastasis research and propose to use them at three levels to systematically interrogate the molecular underpinnings of PDAC metastasis.    We will first perform complementary genome-scale surveys for genes and pathways driving metastasis and metastatic organotropism. We will (i) sequence our unique, largely unpublished resource of 1200 metastatic mouse PDAC, (ii) will perform genome-wide in vivo metastasis screens using transposon tools and approaches, which we pioneered in mice, and (iii) will perturb the human metastasis transcriptome and epigenome.   Second, we will validate newly discovered genes using human PDAC cohorts, and through functional studies in mice. We will deploy next-generation metastasis models based on advanced somatic genome engineering. They allow rapid functional studies at an organismal level, thus capturing the complexity of the metastatic cascade.   Third, building on our recent discovery of two prototype PDAC metastasis drivers, we will perform in depth mechanistic studies to identify underlying molecular networks and vulnerabilities.  This work will unravel - for the first time - comprehensive genetic and functional landscapes of PDAC metastasis. PACA-MET thus promises to uncover fundamental novel biological principles and identify therapeutic targets for one of biggest challenges in medicine.",0,0

926,39812,No,Continous high rate liquid phase epitaxy of textured coated conductors,"Objectives and content:  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a novel process for the continuous high rate production of low cost high critical current coated superconductors on metal and ceramic substrates. The proposed programme addresses longer term scientific and technica1 objectives.  At the end of the project there will be: 1) new scientific knowledge in areas relating to high rate production of coated conductors, and; 2) novel patented technology developed to a prototype level for exploitation by European industry. The technique is based on the recent observation of very high growth rates of ReBCO (eg SmBa2Cu307 a) from a supersaturated flux by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The key feature of the new process is a patented method to obtain and maintain a high super saturation of the rare earth elements in solution at the superconductor growth interface. This enables the growth rate to be increased by orders of magnitude over both conventional melt processing and competing solution growth techniques. The method also provides novel 'boundary layer' control of liquid supply to the growing super-conducting layer.  Coated conductor research has three distinct components: (i) the substrate, (ii) the buffer layer and (iii) the superconducting layer. As a consequence a number of research topics have to be studied within this programme.  The new scientific knowledge generated will include improved understanding of: (i) extreme super saturation of the BaCuOflux with multiple rare earth elements, (ii) high rate epitaxial growth of ReBCO, including transient and steady state growth, (iii) novel control of the boundary layer in liquid supply to the substrate, (iv) innovative processes for buffer layer formation, (v) high power dynamic V-I testing for power engineering applications, and (vi) irradiation enhancement and high field measurement of the critical current of coated tapes for application in magnet technology.  The new technology developed will include, (i) novel patented high temperature LPE techniques, including a lower risk design that depends on delivery of the supersaturated liquid via a stationary porous plug and a higher risk design that depends on a rotating mandrel, (ii) development of precision porous ceramic components, (iii) differential atmosphere control of melting equilibria by dynamic partial pressure metering and electrochemical control, (iv) novel substrate materials, and (v) stress control coating.  It is expected that commercial equipment based on the new technology developed will be available within three years of the termination of the project. The equipment will be able to supply European industry with: (1) continuous lengths of 'coated conductor' for applications involving magnet technology, also (2) large area 'coated ceramic shaped elements' for current lead and fault current limiter applications.

154,4601,Yes,Risk evaluation for genetically modified soil microbial inoculants,"The objectives are: the development and evaluation of alternative vector systems without antibiotic resistance genes as selectable markers, and of suicide systems for the biological containment of soil microbial inoculants; risk assessment on the release of soil microorganisms altered in symbiotically relevant traits and evaluation of strains, recovered from inoculated fields, for genetic and phenotypic properties that may be altered since inoculation (computer assisted analysis).  First year objectives of the project were: development of vector and reporter systems; exploit the natural selection method to obtain various Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains defective in thymidilate synthase, evaluate the performance of thy vector in the rhizosphere under greenhouse and field conditions, and construction of inducible reporter systems. Construction of a suicide system for R meliloti; evaluate the performance of the R meliloti thy in the rhizosphere under greenhouse and field conditions, and genetically manipulate the Lactococcus lactis thy cartridge in preparation for a conditional expression system. Evaluation of genetically modified inoculum strains; during inoculant manufacturing process and at microcosm and greenhouse level. Evaluation of natural occurring populations; to use pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PYMS) to look for distances between isolates of Bradyrhizobium japonicum isolated from soybean plants grown in Italy, to study isolates from Italy using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization, to look at populations of Rhizobium in soil differing characteristics and from different geographic characteristics and from different geographic regions, and to look at the effect of factors such as manipulating the water table on survival.  In work to date the thy system has proved highly effective in ensuring stable maintenance of the plasmid under field conditions. This was found to be the case even though the thy mutant strain was found to revert at a rather high frequency. This demonstrates that the pressure for the thy host strain to revert to a wild type. The lac and lac/Hg{r} cassettes provide a tool which is based on a catabolic inducible reporter system without antibiotic resistance markers. The expression levels, comparable or higher than those obtainable with tac promoter, allow unambiguous detection of the genetically modified microbe. The project is continuing.  Rhizobia are widely used in agriculture as live inoculants for leguminous crops. As a consequence these bacteria represent a major class of man controlled environment impacting microorganisms. Effort was aimed at constructing strains bearing selectable phenotypic traits, namely mercury resistance and beta-galactosidase, devising a microcosm experiment to assess the survival of the modified strains involving stability of the introduced markers and lateral gene transfer to differnet soil bacteria.  The mercury resistant genes were obtained form transposon Tn1831, while the promoterless lacZ gene was from Escherichia coli. The latter is driven by a synthetic promoter to which a regulatory structure, namely the lac operator, has been added to allow inducible expression. The presence of the LacIq was also necessary for the functionality of the regulated system. All of these structures have been asembled into a cartridge. This 10 kilobase pair structure is flanked by unique restriction sites to facilitate cloning procedures. The lac operator can be easily removed, leading ot high level constitutive expression of the lacZ gene.  3 different chimeric plasmids have been prepared, based on the lac-mer catridge. They are currently in coli and are being transferred to Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae strain 1003 via conjugation. For pDG3 the cartridge is inserted in a broad host range vecotr which is a RSF1010 derivative. It is devoid of any antibiotic resistant gene. Bacteria carrying this will have the reporter genes locatedon a plasmid (ie in an unstable form). The pDG4 plasmid is the same as pDG3 except that the lac oeprator has been removed. It will allow to study the effects of a high level expression of the reporter gene on its stability within the host microorganism. The pIRL1 a pSUP102 derivative and contains a fragment of R leguminosarum deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which carries the recA gene sequence. The cartridge is inserted within the coding region thu s inactivating the recA gene. Since this plasmid is not able to replicate in R leguminosarum, the marker genes can be maintained in the host bacterium only if homologous recombination occurs. In this way it wll be possible to have the reporter genes located on the chromosome (ie in a stable form).  The commercial use of microbial inoculants in agriculture can involve the release of large numbers of genetically modified microorganisms into the rhizosphere. Following such environmental release, it is important to be able to monitor the fate of the released microorganisms. It is also desirable to be able to control the persistence and spread of the released microorganisms.  Research is being carried out into the development of suitable marker genes for the unambiguous detection and identification of inoculant strains. An alternative vector system for the introduction and stable maintenance of recombinant genes into microbial inoculant strains has been developed. This vector system is based on the thymidylate synthase (thy) gene, which is essential for de novo deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and therefore for survival of the organism (in the absence of an exogenous supply of thymidine). Attention has been focussed on the thymidylate synthase gene of Rhizobium meliloti. A stable vector system, based on a host strain defective in thymidylate synthase and a broad host range plasmid, which contains a cloned copy of the Lactococcus lactis thy gene, was evaluated. Under greenhouse and field conditions, this vector system ensured stable maintenance of the plasmid throughout the symbiotic life cycle of the Rhizobium inoculant strain.  The survival and persistence of an R meliloti thy mutant has been monitored in greenhouse experiments, in the presence and absence of the alfalfa host plant. Results from these experiments suggest that the inoculum does not persist in soil or rooting solution, but may survive at a reduced level at the root surface of the host plant.  The R meliloti thy gene has been cloned by complementation. The availability of this gene will facilitate genetic manipulation of the thy locus in R meliloti.  The population dynamics of Bradyrhizobium japonicum 902 A released as soil liquid inoculant have been monitored in the presence and absence of its host plant and at low and high water table levels.  The site where it was possible to control the water table level was selected, and the soil traits (physical chemical and biological properties) along with the cropping history were recorded. Bradyrhizobium japonicum was released at a density of 1.6 E9 colony forming units (CFU) in each of the 20 m{2} plots, in the presence and absence of the host plant. 4 repetitions for every plot were carried out; the water table was recorded daily and raised, when appropriate, up to 7 times. The inoculant strain was counted (MPN counts) at 30 days and 3 months after inoculation. Before inoculation, rhizobia were found to be below the MPN detection limit (ie less than 0.6 cells/g of soil dry weight).  The results indicated that both presence of the host plant and water table level greatly affected the survival on inoculated Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first 90 days. The survival in the absence of the host plant decreased by 90% with respect to the initial concentration when the water table was maintained at high levels.  There was a detectable interaction between the presence of the legumionous plant and the depth of the water table with respect to the overall survival rate of the inoculated strain.  Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculants from fields in Italy are being studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PYMS). For PCR analysis low temperatures are used for annealing primers, giving nonhomologous priming to regions of very similar deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence, (random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), PYMS has the advantage that it is an assessment of similarity based on phenotypic differences, whereas RAPD shows relatedness at the level of genomic DNA. Therefore RAPD is very useful for confirmation that derivatives of an inoculant are present at a site, while PYMS allows one to see whether there are changes in the phenotype from the strain introduced.  A field was inoculated with Azofix in 1986 and 1989, and nodules were isolated from soybeans in 1989. To date 28 isolates have been examined using PYMS and 8 of these by RAPD. No isolate was found to be derived from Azofix by either technique. Tho isolates were shown to be almost indistinguishable from an inoculant called NPPL which has been used elsewhere in Italy. PYMS produced 2 groups of isolates; 1 very similar to NPPL and the other similar, but distinguishable. It is assumed that the latter group represent a subset of the population that has drifted gentically.  In another field inoculated with Azofix and a Nitragin inoculant, none of the isolates were derived from Azofix even though it was the last inoculant used. These results indicate that Azofix survives poorly in these soils, or that it nodulates poorly in competiton with other bradyrhizobia.  An advantage of RAPD is that the pattern of bands on a gel is simply to recognize and thus if the patterns derived from isolates does not match the expected inoculant they can easily be compared with those derived from other strains in a collection which might have been used, as was done in this study. The combination of RAPD and PYMS also has the advantage that it gives an indicated of how closely st rains are related to each other, and hence how much they might have drifted genetically. In order to be able to make an assessment of the risks involved in releasing genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) into the environment, it is necessary to have information on the potential for such microorganisms to persist, multiply and spread.   This project will continue work started in the BAP programme to study the population of (genetically modified) rhizobia released into soils in which they are not indigenous. By isolating rhizobia from such soils it is possible to determine population, and hence survival, persistence and spread in different soils. By analysing the chemistry of the soils, cropping history and other relevant characteristics, it is possible to correlate these with the potential for the (genetically modified) rhizobia to persist. This is being done by using various computer based statistical packages.   The different tasks of the project are distributed among partners as follows: the group at the University College Cork (IE) will deal primarily with the development and evaluation of suicide systems for the biological containment of soil microbial inoculants altered in symbiotically relevant traits, and evaluation of alternative vectors without antibiotic resistance genes; the group at the University of Padova (IT) will focus on the development of vectors systems with highly expressed catabolic marker genes, without antibiotic resistance genes as selectable markers, and on the risk assessment of the GMMs released in microcosm and in the field; the group at the HELIGENETICS (IT) will mainly deal with the baseline study on introduced non-modified and genetically modified soil microbial inoculants; the group at the University of Bristol (GB) will focus primarily on collection of data on the populations and trends in relevant computer based retrieval and statistical packages. Isolated strains will be checked fo  genetic and phenotypic properties that may be altered since inoculation.",0,1
775,225084,No,Exploring strong correlations in flat bands,"'One spectacular phenomenon in quantum many-body systems is the emergence of non-local quasiparticles with fractional quantum numbers and anyonic statistics. Of fundamental interest, fractionalization also holds promise for fault-tolerant quantum computation motivating the search for such exotic phases of matter. Signatures of this phenomenon remain sparse and mostly restricted to fractional quantum Hall states, despite being predicted to also occur in other systems such as frustrated quantum magnets. An essential feature shared by both systems is the massive ground state degeneracy, or flat band, out of which fractionalization emerges. The underlying non-local topological order of such phases is an outstanding experimental challenge to detect with only local observables.  Building on my experience to study 'hidden' order in one dimensional systems, I will address the physics of strong correlations in two and three dimensional flatbands using ultracold atoms and the unique probes of atomic physics.  I propose in FLATBANDS to build a novel strontium quantum gas microscope to study both fractional quantum Hall states and highly frustrated magnets. I will first rotate mesoscopic dilute Bose gases to mimic the behaviour of electrons in magnetic fields. Using observables down to individual particles, I will study density-density correlations in the lowest Landau level, providing signatures of emerging Laughlin-like states. On the same platform, I will measure spin correlations and detect fractionalization in highly frustrated magnets. Using atoms trapped in programmable tweezer arrays and excited in Rydberg states, I will engineer quantum spin-ice and directly observe the emergence of magnetic monopoles. By following two complementary routes to address strong correlations and topological order, FLATBANDS will open fascinating perspectives with impact in quantum information, quantum computation, and condensed matter physics.'",0,0

348,195366,No,LOCAL OWNERSHIP IN SECURITY SECTOR REFORM ACTIVITIES WITHIN CSDP OPERATIONS OF THE EU,"Between 2002 and 2014, the EU has deployed 30 civilian and military operations in Europe, Africa and Asia, under its Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). For most of these operations, the EU has a mandate to do activities related to the Security Sector Reform (SSR), aimed at the provision of national and human security within a framework of democratic governance. One of the core assumptions underpinning the EU’s operations has been that SSR has to be “locally owned” in order to be successful, meaning that local agents should internalize principles and objectives of externally driven reforms. Local ownership, however, remains a neglected concept not only theoretically speaking, but it is also very difficult to be implemented in practice. The theoretical and policy gap informs three principal aims of this project. First, the project will adopt a fresh theoretical framework for the study of local ownership. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, the project will conceptualize local ownership as a technology of international security “governmentality” wherein external actors employ set of techniques with the aim of turning local agents into subjects responsible for externally-driven security sector reform agenda. Such an approach will situate local ownership of CSDP operations within a wider context of emerging liberal security governance and explain why it continuously face implementation difficulties in semi-liberal or illiberal settings. Second, the project will obtain new empirical insights into how local ownership is being practised on the ground within three ongoing CSDP operations (EULEX Kosovo, EUPOL COPPS and EUTM Mali) and into why these projects continue to face implementation problems. The third objective of the project is to develop a set of policy recommendations that will assist future policy planners in conceiving more reflexive, context-sensitive and cost-effective local ownership strategies to be applied in current or future CSDP operations.",0,0

A constant supply of novel antiretrovirals (ARVs) is needed to respond to the limitations of current drugs. By the end of 2007, the therapeutic arsenal against HIV is expected to comprise ARVs blocking all major steps of HIV replication, except for particle assembly and budding. Members of HIV-ACE were instrumental in recent breakthroughs concerning virus assembly and Envelope incorporation into virions. On the basis of novel and fully validated targets, the objectives of HIV-ACE are: i) Assay development, drug screening and pre-clinical development of small molecule inhibitors of Capsid assembly and Env incorporation, up to the stage of Early Drug Candidates with acceptable toxicity profile determined by ADME/Tox studies, activity against multi drug-resistant viral strains and primary non-B isolates, antiviral activity in primary T cells and macrophages (WP1); ii) Elucidation of 3D structures of these validated targets and rational drug design guided by molecular modelling and docking of inhibitors (WP2); iii) validation and exploitation of the HIV-susceptible transgenic rat model to allow preclinical in vivo-evaluation of novel drug candidates from HIV-ACE and to provide the European pharmaceutical industry with an efficient in vivo-platform for predictive testing of any kind of anti-HIV drug (WP3); iv) Elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for activity of the validated inhibitors, and discovery/validation of novel targets in the budding pathway of HIV-1 (WP4).

360,227060,No,An innovative peptide system for novel drugs targeting microbial Repeats-In-Toxin adhesins,"Despite progress in infection treatment in the last decades, the prevalence and mortality of infections still poses a heavy burden over humankind. The development of antimicrobial resistance and the rapid mutagenesis of bacteria that leads to inefficiency of vaccines, play an important role in maintaining infections high level of threat. Even diseases that have plagued us for centuries, such as cholera, still challenge medical professionals and cause a significant social cost. New therapeutic approaches that promise a higher success rate are a pressing need. We recently discovered a high similarity between an ice-binding protein and the RTX adhesin (FrhA) used by the bacteria of cholera to attach to and infect the human intestine. Moreover, we discovered compounds that bind to FrhA and successfully block it, suggesting these could help prevent cholera’s infection. If these can also detach already adhered bacteria, cholera could be effectively removed and cured. In this ERC PoC PEPTOX project, we aim to optimise the synthesis and characterization of the newly discovered compounds and demonstrate blockage of cholera adhesion in an in vitro cellular model.",0,0
467,95618,No,Does plant C regulate the decomposition of soil organic matter by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi?,"A major determinant of climate change is the rate at which carbon (C) accumulates in soils and whether they will switch from being a sink to a source. This depends on the fate of the C contained in soil organic matter (SOM), which is released into the atmosphere mostly through the activity of soil saprotrophic microbes. Recent circumstantial evidence suggests that mycorrhizal fungi (MF), symbionts of most land plant roots, can mobilise nutrients from SOM, contributing directly to SOM decomposition. The extent to which MF interact with SOM-C, and how this interaction is regulated, is a matter of current debate which needs to be addressed to understand plant-soil C cycling. Mycorrhizal ericaceous plant species will be used as model systems to determine the link between plant labile C input belowground and involvement of MF in SOM decomposition. This will be done using a natural invasion gradient in the UNESCO world heritage site of Tongariro National Park, New Zealand, where invasion by non native Ericaceae appears to alter the MF communities hosted in native ericaceous species. Both field and laboratory-based experiments will draw upon highly innovative molecular and isotopic approaches, and will benefit from the guidance of world experts in their field, ensuring effective implementation of the project and efficient training of the fellow. The research will provide key strategic information for the understanding of soil C sinks under future climate, a proprietary objective of the FP7 environment and climate theme. The work will further European scientific excellence within the field as well as complementary fields of ecology. Moreover, the fellowship will enable the applicant to bring back to Europe high quality, specialised theoretical and technological skills, providing a decisive opportunity for carving a unique niche in the field, an essential step towards establishment as an independent researcher.",1,0
574,198706,No,Exoribonuclease-mediated degradation of nascent RNA in Malaria Parasites: A Novel Mechanism in Virulence Gene Silencing,"Background: The human protozoan malaria parasite P. falciparum causes approximately 200 million infections and 0.7 million deaths (mainly children) per year. In the well-studied asexual blood stages, cyclic monocistronic gene activation occurs at the transcriptional level; however, relatively few transcription factors have been identified, thus other types of regulatory processes that contribute to this coordinated gene expression are believed to exist. Through the study of molecular process of monoallelic expression of immune evasion genes in P. falciparum (project funded by a previous ERC grant to A. Scherf), we discovered an entirely new mechanism of gene silencing. We demonstrated that an exoribonuclease silences genes linked to severe malaria. A non-canonical 3’-5’exoribonuclease termed PfRNase II destroys nascent RNA made from promoter regions, leading to cryptic unstable mRNA. Parasites carrying a deficient PfRNase II produce full-length mRNA and long noncoding RNA. The molecular events and the number of genes directly controlled by this novel type of posttranscriptional gene silencing remain elusive.  Aim: This proposal aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling PfRNase II-dependent gene silencing using innovative strategies such as the new genome editing technique (Cas9/CRISPR) developed in my laboratory for use in P. falciparum. We will study i) the recruitment of PfRNase II to promoter regions of severe malaria related genes using protein pull-down assays and ii) the genome occupancy of PfRNase II and two other 3’-5’ exoribonucleases to determine the total number of genes controlled by this mechanism. Impact: This project represents a major change in mainstream malaria parasite gene regulation paradigms with repercussions for other organisms. The proposed research will both open new avenues in molecular process that control severe malaria and appeal to young researchers to join this rather ‘untouched’ topic.",0,0

6,42669,Yes,Solution coordination chemistry of uranium - vi - in ternary systems,"Research objectives and content  The first step in any modeling of the chemistry in complex aquatic systems in nature is an analysis of the total concentrations of components and their chemical speciation. Chemical models are necessary for the understanding of solubility control, sorption and the transport of chemical elements in ground and surface water systems.  This proposal deals with the chemistry of uranium(VI) in aqueous sulfate solutions. The focus will be on the formation of ternary complexes. There is very little information on such species, but very good reasons to assume that they are important for speciation. In surface and ground waters were found uranium and sulfate concentrations of about 10-5M and about 3.10-2M (1), respectively. The solution chemistry of this system at sulfate concentrations > O.5M has been investigated by Grenthe and Lagerman (2) using potentiometric methods which provide only provisional information on the chemistry of the system.  In the proposed study we will investigate the system at lower sulfate concentrations and also use other experimental techniques such as 17O-NMR (3), EXAFS and TRLFS to improve the equilibrium model. The focus of the proposed study is on the fundamental chemistry of uranium(VI), but the information obtained is highly relevant for the understanding of uranium(VI) in complex aquatic systems in nature.

307,82688,No,"Design, synthesis and biological studies of novel 1,4-benzoxazepines as antitumour compounds","Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women and is the most frequent cause of cancer death. Over the past 20 years, the 5-year survival for patients with breast cancer has increased by around 10%, largely as a result of earlier diagnosis and better treatment. Nevertheless, 5-year survival rates for people with breast cancer range between 60% and 70%, and many patients still die from the disease. Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was first introduced in 1957, it remains an essential part of the treatment of a wide range of solid tumours. Although this antimetabolite is toxic, its efficacy makes it one of the most widely used agents against solid tumours. 5-FU-containing acyclonucleosides have been reported to induce myogenic differentiation in rhabdomy osarcoma cells, suggesting that these drugs might be useful for differentiation therapy in this type of tumour. Such a therapy is an attractive approach to cancer treatment, which assumes that neoplastic transformation reveals the inability of a cell popul ation to couple proliferation and differentiation signals. Following these results a series of 1,4-benzoxazepines linked to natural or synthesised bases is proposed. A library of compounds will be synthesized in solid phase to rapidly obtain the maximum structural variety. The compounds will be tested as in vitro antiproliferative, apoptotic and cell cycle drug-acting agents against breast cancer. Biological studies will be carried out to determine the mechanism of action at the molecular level. QSAR, SAR and molecular modelling studies will be developed throughout the project.

The scope for this ERA-NET has been developed under the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Animal Health & Welfare Research (CWG AHW), which seeks to build further on 2 previous successful ERA-NETS (EMIDA, ANIHWA). Twenty-eight partners from 19 countries initially seek to support one co-funded call followed by other joint activities including the update of the EU Animal Health Strategic Research Agenda and the initiation of new international partnerships. Animal diseases cause severe social, economic and environmental damage and in some cases threaten human health as well. Disease threats to the livestock industry have increased in the last decades due to globalisation, altering production methods, climate changes and increased contacts between wildlife and livestock. Effective control tools or key knowledge leading to better control is still missing for many important livestock diseases, including for African Swine Fever and animal influenza which pose great challenges in Europe and globally. Partners in this ERA-NET will address these threats through joint European research within a framework which supports multi-disciplinary research in the fields of (i) fundamental understanding of host/(vector)/pathogen interactions and the epidemiology of disease; (ii) vaccinology and (iii) diagnostics. Research and innovation coordinated through ICRAD will (i) increase preparedness and ability to respond to emerging and endemic livestock threats; (ii) provide improved vaccines and diagnostic tools and strategies; (iii) contribute to the reduction of antibiotic and antiparasitic resistance; and (iv) contribute to animal welfare by better disease prevention. By reducing the burden of animal disease and its impact on international trade, ICRAD will enhance food security and sustainable livestock production.",1,0

The participating universities design a total of five learning modules over the lifespan of the project which will be complemented by dynamic information collected by web-search agents, constantly updated benchmarking solutions, and chat facilities. In the second trial, the improved version of SMART-Up will be tested by a larger group of SMEs in order to finally create a learning tool that ensures a fast and cheap know-how amongst tourism SMEs and knwo-how producers (e.g. universities) throughout Europe.  Objectives: The main goal is to alleviate know-how gaps of SMEs in tourism in the use of IT and specified areas of tourism management, thereby rendering the enterprises more competitive. This will also benefit tourists through an improved value of tourism services. The SMART-UP network also provides a learning platform to foster the use and acceptance of the latest available IT. The project aims at creating a low cost, easy to access knowledge co-operation of know-how providers and SMEs throughout Europe, thus increasing the innovation potential. Technical objectives include the dissemination of the Intelligent Agent Technology in the field of education and training in tourism, and the design of a flexible learning tool that allows individual and constant adjustments to users needs. The main business goal is to initiate a widely accepted learning platform for European tourism SMEs.  Work description: The proposed work schedule starts with the selection of 75 suitable tourism SMEs in Austria, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, and Switzerland. In initial workshops, the participating users will be invited to specify both content and technical requirements in co-operation with Siemens and Sigma. Based on the technical requirements, SIGMA will outline a tailored IT training program for the participating SMEs including both general introduction into IT and specific training on the SMART-UP learning tool. Simultaneously, two of the participating university institutes will work on the content development of initially two virtual learning modules and the corresponding benchmarking cases covering the tourism specific areas of 'human resource management' and 'quality management'. For the second trial, learning modules on 'capacity management', 'product development' and 'eCommerce in Tourism' will be added. In the meanwhile, Siemens will deploy the SITOS(r) e-learning system as well as the intelligent agent platform. Combined with a common graphical web-based user interface, the SMART-Up virtual learning company emerges, which will be constantly adapted according to the users' feedback throughout the trial. Ongoing evaluation provides information on evaluation results and user acceptance as a basis for product improvements. No less than 180 SMEs will be involved in the second trial in Month 11. Based on the evaluation of the results regarding user acceptance and improved know how during the trial phase, the OHV and other European intermediaries (represented by the advisory board of European hotel associations) will develop effective dissemination and distribution strategies for European tourism SMEs.  Milestones: SMART-UP will modify the learning tool SITOS and the agent platforms for the specific needs of tourism SMEs. This will be achieved by performing two trials (month 6 & 11) with a number of 180 end users in Europe. Major milestones of this proposal are the delivery of 2 trial demonstration versions according to the user requirements and a conference SMART-UP demonstrator as well as a business plan for future providers.",0,0

40,204825,Yes,"Gradual and abrupt environmental change: connecting physiology, evolution and community composition","A major goal in ecology is to predict how environmental changes, including drivers of global change, affect communities and ecosystem functioning, with society demanding answers to these pressing questions. A key limitation of virtually all experimental approaches addressing such questions is that treatments are delivered abruptly, while many changes occurring in nature are gradual. Here I propose to comprehensively study consequences of environmental change when delivered abruptly vs. gradually. In order to understand and model effects of gradual vs. abrupt changes, we need to simultaneously consider physiological effects (e.g. acclimation), evolutionary changes (e.g. adaptation) and changes in community composition and functioning. Even though changes at these levels likely interact, there is no study in which physiology, evolutionary changes and community shifts have been studied in response to a changing environmental factor. This research program thus enters unchartered territory of empirical environmental research in proposing work at this nexus of physiology, environmental change and community composition/ function. I focus on soil fungi, key players in terrestrial ecosystems, testing a range of gradually vs. abruptly changing environmental factors, in a range of soils, in the field and in microcosms. We connect differential responses to species traits, apply modeling and employ data syntheses across all biomes and organisms to achieve high external validity. We carry out a set of core experiments that will afford unprecedented insight into the nature of change in a community context in response to warming, focusing on soil fungi. In these we follow evolutionary change (phenotype and genotype), test physiological shifts by re-isolation of fungi and monitor community changes. This work will have transformative character in providing not only new mechanistic insights into effects of environmental change, but will also represent a step change in fungal ecology.",1,1
405,100169,No,Towards marker assisted selection against genetic defects in pigs,"The project focuses on the rapid identification of genes underlying congenital disorders in pigs for effective marker assisted selection (MAS) against genetic defects.

For most of these defects there are strong indications for a genetic component and different research groups all over Europe have made efforts to find the underlying causative genetic mechanisms. However, the mode of inheritance seems complex and no genes or mutations have been identified yet. This project aims to group the efforts of different research groups that are currently working on inherited genetic defects in pigs. Through this collaboration a faster identification of the genes and suitable gene markers for use in marker assisted selection against defects in pigs will be obtained.

300,88031,No,Developement of robust and quantitative biosensors based on near-infrared two-dyed silicate nanoparticles,"The aim of this project is to develop quantitative biological sensors based on fluorescent spherical silicate nanoparticles (amorphous silica, zeolite beta) in controlled sizes in the range of 50 to 200 nanometers in diameter. The quantification of the analyte is based on a ratiometric detection of fluorescence from two dyes. The dyes are chosen such that the fluorescence of one dye is a function of an analyte (ion, biomolecule) concentration (sensing dye) whereas the fluorescence of the other dye is independent of variations in the medium (reference dye). Both dyes have the near-infrared light absorption property which lead to significant improvements for the detection in biological samples. The first step consists in confining a dye in the inorganic network yielding highly brilliant and photostable objects. Thus this fluorescent hybrid core can be used as the reference dye. Afterwards the ability of such material to undergo further chemical modification through the surface silanol functions and the use of coupling agents allows the immobilization of the sensing dye (commercially available or developed in the host structure).

The work will focus on the establishment of criteria for Mediterranean landscapes  management based on the trends observed in long-term environmental changes. The  research will be developed according to the following points: Territorial and chronological characterisation of the bioclimatic evolution in the critical areas; evaluation of the vulnerability of the vegetal landscape; obtention of action guidelines with regard to the protection of recoverable areas; establishment of optimisation patterns of the natural values of the landscape in relation with the confluence of bioecological, geomorphological patterns and human activities.

To examine the links between business decision-making and environmental policy and to analyze the relevance of LCA for European environmental policy.  The BIODEPTH project uses experimental and other approaches to investigate the impacts of reducing biodiversity on ecosystem structure and processes, along two intersecting transects across Europe. BIODEPTH focuses on natural and semi natural herbaceous plant communities as model systems. The project, the first of its kind to be attempted anywhere in the world, will quantify the effects on ecosystem structure and processes of reducing plant species richness in herbaceous communities. BIODEPTH is a unique experiment, combining field manipulations of biodiversity with theoretical modelling, and studies of ecosystem processes on existing diversity gradients. It directly addresses Research Task 1.2.2.3 of the Environment and Climate Work Programme. Within that Work Programme, TERI (Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Institute) seeks to quantify and predict links between biodiversity, population biology and ecosystem function. The proposal reviews the limited theoretical and empirical data currently available in this area, and defines five hypotheses that will be tested and which characterise expected responses between ecosystem function and species richness.  To achieve BIODEPTH's objectives, field experiments will be conducted in Sweden, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal and Greece; France will lead the modelling programme. The same basic experiment will be conducted in each participating country, using standard protocols. BIODEPTH mimics world- and European-wide loss of plant biodiversity by experimentally creating replicate plant communities with reduced species-richness, from the pool of native, local species present at each site. The experiments are not designed to reproduce the effects of losing particular taxa (eg species of high conservation interest) from European ecosystems. Rather, they are designed to reveal general principles, and to develop predictive ability. Models linking ecophysiology, population dynamics and ecosystem processes will provide new ways of understanding when, how and why biodiversity affects ecosystem function The proposal evaluates the risks of failure (considered to be very low), and summarises benefits and links with other planned and existing European environmental networks (CANIF, Eddy Covariance and DEPO).

816,194524,No,"Rounding the circle: Unravelling the biogenesis, function and mechanism of action of circRNAs in the Drosophila brain.","Tight regulation of RNA metabolism is essential for normal brain function. This includes co and post-transcriptional regulation, which are extremely prevalent in neurons. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs), a highly abundant new type of regulatory non-coding RNA have been found across the animal kingdom. Two of these RNAs have been shown to act as miRNA sponges but no function is known for the thousands of other circRNAs, indicating the existence of a widespread layer of previously unknown gene regulation. The present proposal aims to comprehensively determine the role and mode of actions of circRNAs in gene expression and RNA metabolism in the fly brain. We will do so by studying their biogenesis, transport, and mechanism of action, as well as by determining the roles of circRNAs in neuronal function and behaviour. Briefly, we will:  1) identify factors involved in the biogenesis, localization, and stabilization of circRNAs; 2) determine neuro-developmental, molecular, neural and behavioural phenotypes associated with down or up regulation of specific circRNAs; 3) study the molecular mechanisms of action of circRNAs: identify circRNAs that work as miRNA sponges and determine whether circRNAs can encode proteins or act as signalling molecules and 4) perform mechanistic studies in order to determine cause-effect relationships between circRNA function and brain physiology and behaviour.  The present proposal will reveal the key pathways by which circRNAs control gene expression and influence neuronal function and behaviour.  Therefore it will be one of the pioneer works in the study of this new and important area of research, which we predict will fundamentally transform the study of gene expression regulation in the brain",0,0
522,200795,No,Integrating spatial and genetic information via automated image analysis and interactive visualization of tissue data,"Digital imaging of tissue samples and genetic analysis by next generation sequencing are two rapidly emerging fields in pathology. The exponential growth in digital imaging in pathology is catalyzed by more advanced imaging hardware, comparable to the complete shift from analog to digital images that took place in radiology a couple of decades ago: Entire glass slides can be digitized at near the optical resolution limits in only a few minutes’ time, and fluorescence as well as bright field stains can be imaged in parallel.   Genetic analysis, and particularly transcriptomics, is rapidly evolving thanks to the impressive development of next generation sequencing technologies, enabling genome-wide single-cell analysis of DNA and RNA in thousands of cells at constantly decreasing costs. However, most of today’s available technologies result in a genetic analysis that is decoupled from the morphological and spatial information of the original tissue sample, while many important questions in tumor- and developmental biology require single cell spatial resolution to understand tissue heterogeneity.  The goal of the proposed project is to develop computational methods that bridge these two emerging fields. We want to combine spatially resolved high-throughput genomics analysis of tissue sections with digital image analysis of tissue morphology. Together with collaborators from the biomedical field, we propose two approaches for spatially resolved genomics; one based on sequencing mRNA transcripts directly in tissue samples, and one based on spatially resolved cellular barcoding followed by single cell sequencing. Both approaches require development of advanced digital image processing methods. Thus, we will couple genetic analysis with digital pathology. Going beyond visual assessment of this rich digital data will be a fundamental component for the future development of histopathology, both as a diagnostic tool and as a research field.",0,0

This is particularly true for the actin cytoskeleton, a major component of the internal architecture of eukaryotic cells.  In living cells, actin networks constantly assemble and disassemble filaments while maintaining an apparent stable structure, suggesting a perfect balance between the two processes. Such behaviors are called “dynamic steady states”. They confer upon actin networks a high degree of plasticity allowing them to adapt in response to external changes and enable cells to adjust to their environments. Despite their fundamental importance in the regulation of cell physiology, the basic mechanisms that control the coordinated dynamics of co-existing actin networks are poorly understood. In the AAA project, first, we will characterize the parameters that allow the coupling among co-existing actin networks at steady state. In vitro reconstituted systems will be used to control the actin nucleation patterns, the closed volume of the reaction chamber and the physical interaction of the networks. We hope to unravel the mechanism allowing the global coherence of a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Second, we will use our unique capacity to perform dynamic micropatterning, to add or remove actin nucleation sites in real time, in order to investigate the ability of dynamic networks to adapt to changes and the role of coupled network dynamics in this emergent property. In this part, in vitro experiments will be complemented by the analysis of actin network remodeling in living cells. In the end, our project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how the adaptive response of the cytoskeleton derives from the complex interplay between its biochemical, structural and mechanical properties.",0,0

18,92679,Yes,Biotic community attributes and ecosystem functioning: implications for predicting and mitigating global change impacts,"Increases in nutrient availability and temperature, and changes in precipitation patterns and biodiversity are important components of global environmental change. Thus, it is imperative to understand their impacts on the functioning of natural ecosystems. Substantial research efforts are being currently devoted to predict how biodiversity will respond to global change. However, little is known on the relative importance of biodiversity against other attributes of biotic communities, such as species cover and spatial pattern, as a driver of ecosystem processes. Furthermore, the effects of global change on the relationships between these attributes and ecosystem functioning are virtually unknown. This project aims to evaluate the relationships between community attributes (species richness, composition, evenness, cover, and spatial pattern) and key processes related to ecosystem functioning under different global change scenarios. Its specific objectives are to: i) evaluate the relative importance of community attributes as drivers of ecosystem functioning, ii) assess how multiple global change drivers will affect key ecosystem processes, iii) test whether global change drivers modify observed community attributes-ecosystem functioning relationships, iv) develop models to forecast global change effects on ecosystem functioning, and v) set up protocols for the establishment of mitigation actions based on the results obtained. They will be achieved by integrating experimental and modeling approaches conducted with multiple biotic communities at different spatial scales. Such integrated framework has not been tackled before, and constitutes a ground breaking advance over current research efforts on global change. This proposal will also open the door to new research lines exploring the functional role of community attributes and their importance as modulators of ecosystem responses to global change.",1,1
32,227167,Yes,Tropical rain forest diversification: a GLOBAL approach,"Tropical rain forests (TRF) are the most species rich yet highly threatened ecosystems on Earth. They play pivotal roles as global climate regulators and for human wellbeing. Their long term conservation is central for global climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Elucidating the evolutionary processes that underpin this immense diversity is critical for improved conservation actions. What evolutionary processes determine TRF diversity? How will human-induced species losses impact the evolutionary history of TRF? Time calibrated phylogenies retain the fingerprint of these patterns and are fundamental prerequisites to maximize the conservation of evolutionary history. However, global densely sampled robust phylogenies are lacking for TRF plants, significantly limiting our ability to properly address these questions. I will generate the largest most comprehensive datasets ever assembled for a major, ecologically important and species-rich pantropical model plant family: Annonaceae (~2500 species). First, I will test major hypotheses about TRF evolution at a global scale and what biotic and abiotic factors drove their diversification. Then, I will predict the impact of plant species extinction on the evolutionary history of TRF. Using the extensive network of European herbaria, I will reconstruct a robust time-calibrated complete species level phylogenomic tree of Annonaceae. I will compile massive morphological, chemical and geographical datasets for all species. Novel paleoclimatic data will be modelled through space at ten discrete periods over the last 100 million years. These data will then be integrated using innovative statistical macroevolutionary comparative approaches to answer the above questions at never achieved levels of precision. GLOBAL will provide improved predictions of TRF evolution informing conservation policies, and set the new standard for next generation evolutionary studies of TRF evolution applicable to other key tropical groups.",1,1
53,98500,Yes,Increasing the potential of economically valuable tree species to survive drought,"Climate change is confronting forestry with new challenges. The ideal future forest would consist of species coping well with increasing drought and concurrently provide timber of high economic value. Common beech and Douglas-fir are economically valuable species, but whether they will cope with increasing drought remains unclear. Yet, eco(physio)logical studies to assess plasticity of species in growth response and adaption to drought often concern trees from the distribution border, leading to the formulation of climate envelopes for different species. A more straightforward approach to assess growth response to drought, which is largely neglected up to now, is studying growth performance of different provenances of a species. The establishment of large provenance trials with beech and Douglas-fir in the context of the Cost Action E52 and IUFRO programs offers an unique opportunity to study provenance performance under various environmental conditions throughout Europe. The proposed study aims to designating provenances of beech and Douglas-fir that perform well under drought. Indicators for performance are radial growth dynamics, wood anatomy and water-conducting capacity. To do so, the growth response  to drought of 5 provenances per species will be studied at different locations in Europe by evaluating tree growth, wood structure and technological properties. To link wood anatomy and eco-physiology water-transport capacity is measured using NMR imaging. The approach of combining tree growth analysis, enabling retrospective analyses on the growth dynamics under drought with advanced NMR imaging to assess physiological implications of drought on tree vitality on different provenances of beech and Douglas-fir is unprecedented. Besides adding the variable ‘genetics’ to dendro-sciences, it will have practical implication if it comes to the selection of suitable plant material to guarantee sustainable ecological and economical performance in a drier future climate.",1,1

The main objective of my proposed action is to identify the role of SIK3 in the central nervous system (CNS) in the regulation of energy balance and study its suitability as a target to develop an anti-obesity therapy. To achieve this, I will use virogenetic approaches in Sik3-ex13 flox mice and a neuron-specific mutant mice line for exon 13 of Sik3 gene will be generated. The molecular characterization of the animal models will be conducted by using several cutting-edge techniques such as RNA-Seq and phosphoproteomics. The identified targets will be functionally analyzed using genetics approaches. In sum, by doing the proposed project I will expect to uncover the influence of a potential new sensor in metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, this work in combination with the one going already on in Y/F Lab in relation to sleep may allow to understand the interrelationship between sleep disorders and obesity.",0,0
963,107860,No,"Metaphysics of identity, properties, and relations in fundamental physics","This project belongs to the category of philosophical reflection on the metaphysical consequences of contemporary physical theories. The metaphysical problems that are to be considered concern the analysis of the fundamental notions of objects, identity, individuality, and properties. The central question regarding these concepts is whether and how the numerical distinctness of objects can be grounded in the differences in their qualitative properties. In the light of the recent arguments against the validity of the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles within the quantum theory of many particles, it is now common to seek the metaphysical grounding of numerical distinctness in the entire relational structures comprising the objects in question. Alternatively, the hypothesis of the primitive character of numerical identity and distinctness is considered. The project will attempt to investigate these metaphysical issues in the context of a broad range of modern physical theories, including non-relativistic quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum field theory, general relativity, and quantum gravity.  Particular attention will be paid to the notion of quantum entanglement and its numerous metaphysical consequences regarding the individuality of objects, the intrinsicness of their properties, and the supervenience of whole structures on individual objects and their properties. The hypothesis of ontic structural realism, with its emphasis on the ontological priority of relational structures over their relata, will be put to the test taking into account the recent developments in fundamental physics. This project is an interdisciplinary undertaking, combining a general metaphysical framework with logical and formal tools and concepts derived from fundamental physical theories.",0,0
684,217533,No,"Genetics of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) in children, and the childhood predictors of adulthood MHO and MUNW","Background: Recent large-scale genomic studies have provided evidence that a number of genetic variants implicate an inverse relationship between increased adiposity and an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile. So far, it is not known whether the loci showing “favorable adiposity”-like associations exert their influence already in childhood.  Objectives: The aims of the project proposed are 1.The identification of gene variants associated with increased adiposity yet a favorable cardiometabolic profile in children and adolescents and  2. Identification of the childhood genetic and environmental predictors of adult metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW).  The approach: To study, whether such “favorable adiposity” genetic effects are found already in childhood, I will perform a meta-analysis of six child populations from Finland, Denmark and England including a total sample size of 10,038 children and adolescents aged 3-18 years.  To examine associations of childhood genetic and environmental factors with MHO and MUNW in adulthood, I will utilize follow-up data from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study.  The impact: Identification of MHO and MUNW related genetic variants in children and the childhood predictors of adult MHO and MUNW will help to assess the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease as well as to target interventions in the high-risk groups. The ability to improve advice and intervention measures would help alleviate the burden of obesity-related comorbidities on health care systems worldwide.

397,54494,No,Prediction of Temperature Gradients Influencing the Quality of Electronic Products,"Many business objectives related to yield, performance, reliability or safety are functions of temperature (gradients). PROFIT aims to create methods and tools to enable a timely assessment of these objectives in all stages of the product creation process. Today's analyses are seriously hampered by the lack of methods to predict temperature gradients in time and space at package, board and system level with sufficient accuracy. The project aims to overcome these drawbacks by major improvements in experimental techniques to acquire input data, in non-linear parameter estimation methods and in transient thermal characterisation of components. Standardisation is considered an important deliverable. Ultimately, the results are suited for implementation in emerging virtual prototyping methods and physic-based reliability analysis software.   Objectives: Safety, performance and reliability of electronic products are a function of temperature. Higher accuracy in temperature predictability gives better control of design and manufacturing. Higher-quality products have a positive impact on the product's life-cycle-cost and people's quality of life.  Industrial problems: 1. Cost/weight reduction with better quality 2. Physics-based prediction of reliability 3. Yield improvement of packages 4. Awareness of problems due to the absence of useful design specs 5. Standardisation of thermal characterisation.  Solutions offered by PROFIT: 1. Significant improvements in temperature prediction for virtual prototyping 2. Accurate predictability of temperature gradients in time and space 3. Better-defined rejection criteria based on in-line quality testing 4. Dissemination of combined thermal expertise in EU through international contacts.  Work description: The work will be directed towards major improvements in thermal analysis of the whole electronic design chain, from device via package and board to system. Important data required for accurate numerical analysis are lacking: interface resistances, emissivities, local boundary conditions and local board thermal conductivities, for which test setups will be built based on transient temperature measurements. Transient measurements at device and package level will be performed to assess their quality. Analysis of the data will be treated by using novel non-linear parameter estimation methods. Software will be improved, developed and integrated to facilitate the application of the project results in performance and reliability calculations. Various demonstrators showing the final deliverables are foreseen. The EU lead in thermal characterisation of steady-state compact models will be extended to the transient domain. Yearly workshops will be organised to promote discussion amongst experts, and to facilitate early standardisation.  In short, the innovative elements are: - Novel statistical approach for the optimisation of experiments, analysis of transient data and generation of compact models. - Novel measurement techniques for the acquisition of input data. - Novel electrothermal and thermomechanical board/system level software. - New proposals for the standardisation of transient thermal characterisation.  The Workpackages show clearly the required elements of the design chain: device, package, board, system. All parties needed to fulfil the objectives are in the consortium: semiconductor manufacturers, system makers, thermal software vendors, an SME focussing on statistics, a university specialised in electrothermal analysis and transient measurements, and a major research institution contributing in the fabrication of test dies and tool integration.

272,83426,No,Quantum Transport in Nanoconstrictions made of no magnetic metals,"Ability to exploit spin transport in semiconductor promises new logic devices with enhanced functionality, higher speeds and reduce power consumption. In addition, these new devices could be fabricated with many of the tools already used in the electronic industry. Therefore, one of the current objectives in the research in Spintronics is to develop new materials of easy compatibility with semiconductor materials and processing. Development of new materials suitable for spin-polarized transport supposes to devote many efforts and resources to the quest of 100 spinpolarized materials.  The important room temperature ferromagnetic metals (Co, Fe and Ni) and their alloys have a spin-polarization of the carriers near the Fermi level of aprox. 50 %.

Spin injection is the process by which a highly spin polarization current is transmitted from the ferromagnetic metal into another material such as another metal, a semiconductor, while retaining its spin-polarization character.

An Integrated Evolutionary (complex systems) Framework for the evolution and understanding of the social, political and environmental factors contributing to environmental degradation and potential desertification, will be then developed. The following case-studies are selected.  The Vera Basin, in Southeastern Spain, is badly degraded to the point that badlands dominate and very little vegetation is left. Here, studies will be undertaken to develop methods to look at the temporalities in the physical and anthropogenic processes involved in a succession of phases of degradation/desertification, with a view to a better understanding of the concept sustainability.  The Argolid in the Southern Peloponnese in Greece, is an area where water (mis)management is responsible for the spectre of rapid and total degradation in the vary near future. This study focuses on human decision-making on the micro-scale, and notably on the dynamics between short-term and long-term perception and decision- making in the context of the choice between individual advantage and the common good. Here, dynamical models of hydrology and water management of present-day farmers'perceptions and decision making with respect to water management, which can serve to help policy implementation will be developed.  Epirus, in the Northwest Greece, is a region in which the differential impact of tectonics plays and where the difference between long-term and short-term processes comes to the force from an environmental perspective. Here, studies on long-term local climate/erosion sequence will be undertaken and a dynamical model of the tectonics of the area, and their relation to land use, degradation and desertification will be developed.

199,90442,Yes,Probabilistic Assessment of the Retention and Transport of Sediments and Associated Pollutants in Rivers,"Sediment dynamics in water bodies has been the subject of much study. Previously studies on moving sediments has focussed on their role in morphology. Recently, the transport and accumulation of sediment in natural rivers has become of interest to environmental scientists, as many pollutants are associated with sediments. Deterministic models still commonly used in engineering practice model sediment transport with average quantities. The latest research models use stochastic and now particle tracking approaches to better reflect nature. Random variable analysis is starting to be used but there is little data to test the new models. Grain scale measurements of transport have only recently been achieved as instrumental capabilities have increased. Increasing computing capability now has the potential to treat fluvial sediment systems with true probabilistic based simulations in which the fate of each particle can be individually tracked and modelled. Such a form of sediment modelling is still limited by the existing knowledge of the relevant grain scale physics rather than by computational limitations. The oldest but still most difficult questions to answer about river sediments is whether they do or do not move under the action of the flow and when in motion, where do they rest and for how long. The current proposal will use advanced instrumentation to measure hundreds of moving grains and local flow velocities. This data will be used to develop probabilistic approaches for transport rate prediction, further development of an existing discrete particle model will allow the time history of their grain movement including rest periods and their ultimate fate to be statistically described. This level of information will be required in the next generation of modelling tools that environmental scientists will need to predict the impact of pollutants associated with sediments that move and are then retained within river deposits for periods of time.",1,1

De facto, today’s scientific communication ecosystem lacks tools and practices to allow researchers to fully embrace Open Science. OpenAIRE-Connect aims to provide technological and social bridges, and deliver services enabling uniform exchange of research artefacts (literature, data, and methods), with semantic links between them, across research communities and content providers in scientific communication. It will introduce and implement the concept of Open Science as a Service (OSaaS) on top of the existing OpenAIRE infrastructure, delivering out-of-the-box, on-demand deployable tools. OpenAIRE-Connect will adopt an end-user driven approach (via the involvement of 5 prominent research communities), and enrich the portfolio of OpenAIRE infrastructure production services with a Research Community Dashboard Service and a Catch-All Notification Broker Service. The first will offer publishing, interlinking, packaging functionalities to enable them to share and re-use their research artifacts (introducing “methods, e.g. data,software, protocols). This effort, supported by the harvesting and mining “intelligence” of the OpenAIRE infrastructure, will provide communities with the content and tools they need to effectively evaluate and reproduce science. OpenAIRE-Connect will combine dissemination and training with OpenAIRE’s powerful NOAD network engaging  research communities and content providers in adopting such services. These combined actions will bring immediate and long-term benefits to scholarly communication stakeholders by affecting the way research results are disseminated, exchanged, evaluated, and re-used.",0,0
42,203485,Yes,A novel approach to determine canopy nitrification in the phyllosphere of European forests: combining multiple isotope tracers and proteogenomic techniques,"Forest canopies play a significant role in regulating carbon and water exchanges with the atmosphere, with profound effects on our climate. However, their role in altering the chemical composition of precipitation and, consequently, the nutrient cycling within a forest has been less investigated. This is particular relevant for nitrogen (N)-limited forests in the Northern hemisphere, which have been exposed to a rapid human-induced increase in Ndep over the last decades. Much of the  scientific attention has been focused on the role of Ndep in enhancing forest C-sink, while we still need to elucidate the fate of Ndep when entering forest and its contribution to N cycling. In particular, it is still not clear whether Ndep is retained, taken up and/or altered by biological transformations when interacting with tree canopies. By applying a quadruple isotope approach I recently demonstrated the occurrence of in-canopy biological nitrification of atmospheric N for UK forests at high Ndep. Hence, NITRIPHYLL intends to extend the multiple isotope approach a) to enlarge the range of conditions under which the process is demonstrated to occur, b) to investigate difference between species in the proportion of microbiologically-derived NO3 and c) the reasons of these differences. Furthermore, by using proteo-genomic techniques we aim to characterize phyllosphere microbial communities involved in canopy nitrification. We will consider i) forests along  a gradient of climate and Ndep within the well established EU-ICP forest network and ii) existing N manipulation experiments. NITRIPHYLL for the first time merges two separate research avenues, i.e., the investigation of canopy nitrification with the study of the occurrence, abundance and diversity of bacteria communities in the phyllosphere.  Thus, the project will contribute to providing  a deeper understanding of how the phyllosphere affects the N, and consequently C, cycling within forests in relation to climate and Ndep.",1,1

In addition to voice and data the transmission will include still and full motion video.  Unlimited mobility requires the use of satellite links.  The new 'high speed data' service presently being prepared by Inmarsat opens far-reaching opportunities in this area.  The aim of the research was to demonstrate the benefits of using mobile ship to shore communications to give shore based experts the opportunity of assisting the crew to solve nonroutine maintenance and repair problems. In addition to voice and data transmission, communications will include still and full motion video. Unlimited mobility requires the use of satellite links and the new high speed data service presently bing prepared by INMARSAT opens far reaching opportunities in this area. Key issues of the research included: system integration of appropriate hardware and software modules for a pilot application; selection and demonstration of realistic scenarios showing the benefits and cost effectiveness of the approach and an assessment of market acceptance.  A first phase devoted to preconceptual investigations resulted in a status quo description and an analysis of pilot application functions. One of the subsystem trials was devoted to a user oriented assessment of the potential for video support to maintenance and repair operations. This was achieved in a closed loop laboratory arrangement, which included high rate video compression. Another was related to acquiring integrated video, (data and voice transmission over Diginet, the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and EVS, even across international borders).  The configuration, the laboratory pretesting, set up and final sea testing of the microwave link between the ship and Stockelsdorf radio tower platform for the terrestrial station was carried out and a further integration of the transmission line between the model head office in Bremen and the ship; and also between Bremen and the model expert location in Helsinki was also completed. A first test of a complete loop including the space segment and the terrestrial line was demonstrated and was able to transmit compressed video in a store and forward mode. Technical Approach    For shipborne tests, a large ferry Railship III has been selected and appropriately equipped.  Performance of the pilot application must be limited to that possible using mobile equipment available today.  The technical approach is therefore to examine the intended application from two opposite sides:    . Option 1 utilises full transmission capacity at 2 Mbit/s, but has to compromise on mobility as the satellite link is replaced by microwave transmission, covering the ship only when in port and during its initial course out to sea   . Option 2 provides full mobility based on satellite transmission using upgraded Standard A ship earth terminals and a new 'high speed data' service presently operating at 64 kbit/s.    The land based network is basically the same for both options.  However, the bandwidth need not be larger than that of the ship-to-shore link.  The project will use the most economic of several potentially available options: EBIT service, the European video conferencing service, N-ISDN or Diginet.    Year 92 will be devoted to the set-up and test of the extension of multimedia conferencing to a three-partner configuration - a service going beyond the standard EVS offerings.  In addition to further tests in the context of Option 2 system integration, the system will be demonstrated at different European exhibitions.    Key Issues   . System integration of appropriate hardware and software modules for a pilot application giving an adequate representation of the future product.   . Selection and demonstration of realistic scenarios showing the benefits and cost effectiveness of the approach and assessment of market acceptance.    Achievements   A first project phase devoted to pre-conceptual investigations resulted in two deliverables: D1 giving a  status quo description; and D2 an analysis of pilot application functions.  On this basis the pilot system concept was established and detailed planning for the execution phase undertaken (deliverable D3).    Results of the preparation and execution of sub-system trials were given in further deliverables: D4.1 Status of the preparation and execution of sub-system investigations, Part 1 and D4.2 Ibid, Part 2.  One of the trials was devoted to a user-oriented assessment of the potential for video support to maintenance and repair operations.  This was achieved in a closed loop laboratory arrangement, which included high-rate video compression.  Another effort was related to acquiring integrated video/data/voice transmission over Diginet, ISDN and EVS, even across international borders.    Deliverable D4.3: Ship-to-Shore 2 Mbit/s Microwave Link describes the configuration, laboratory pre-testing, set-up and final sea-testing of the microwave link between the ship and Stockelsdorf radio tower, platform for the terrestrial station.  D4.4: Laboratory System Integration reports on a further integration step of the transmission line between the model head-office in Bremen and the ship; and also between Bremen and the model 'expert' location in Helsinki.  For Option II a first test of a complete loop including the space segment and the terrestrial line was demonstrated, transmitting compressed video in a store-and-forward mode.    D4.5: Marketing and User Acceptance Investigation collected views of relevant market participants on the expected benefits of this area of improved mobile communication to ships.  The answers are mainly positive, in particular, by the owners of larger and highly sophisticated vessels, oil rigs and exploration platforms.  In addition, the consortium produced a video tape describing the system concept and demonstrating elements of a typical maintenance and repair scenario supported by multimedia conferencing.    Expected Impact   The pilot application will demonstrate to participants in the shipping business what advantages could be gained by the use of advanced mobile and land-based communications concepts.  The investments to be made are moderate.  A first generation of this new service addresses the 14000 ships with Standard A satellite terminals which could be upgraded and be used for the benefits of the new concept in the very near future.    In addition, as new light-weight mobile terminals become available, the application may be extended to any remote maintenance activity in remote areas.",0,0
957,108309,No,Capacity and Energy Efficiency Limits of Wireless Communications for Heterogeneous Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) Deployment,"Approaching new horizons of capacity and energy efficiency is foundational for next-generation broadband wireless communications. Toward this goal, the IOF proposal “Career LTE” pursues fundamental research with inter-disciplinary efforts, and integrates the outcome with engineering practice, to push forward the state-of-the-art of performance and energy efficiency for heterogeneous Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) deployment.  Capacity and energy have been dealt with from the perspectives of information theory, optimization, physical layer technologies, and networking. To go beyond the cutting edge, the time has come to depart from each of these perspectives alone, toward producing new knowledge by synergizing these fields.  The outgoing phase develops computational models for analyzing emerging capacity-enhancing concepts, and investigates fundamental performance-energy tradeoffs. Here, the fellow extends his knowledge with information theory, and cross-layer and green networking, and fuses them with his strong background in optimization and industrial experience in 4G radio access. Integrating the molded knowledge with the fellow’s experience in European industry, the return phase develops new methodologies for energy-efficient heterogeneous LTE-A deployment.  The applicant has an excellent track record in publications and funding, along with industrial experience. His professional achievements so far demonstrate his ability to quickly absorb new knowledge and develop leadership skills. In addition to the scientific objectives, the IOF project benefits: 1) the fellow’s long-term career goal of becoming a world-class ICT research leader, 2) a long-standing European-USA research and educational link for life-long learning, 3) the formation of a knowledge-dynamic team to attract young and talented researchers for careers in ICT Europe, 4) European industrial competitiveness by turning scientific findings into innovation via the fellow’s background at Ericsson.",0,0
27,2716,Yes,Heavy metal toxicity to soil microbes,"The objective is to establish which metals, and at which concentrations, can result in the negative effects observed in symbiotic nitrogen fixation, functioning of VA mycorrhiza and the turnover of carbon and nitrogen through the microbial biomass in soils contaminated with metals. Also to evaluate the need for revision of the maximum permitted metal concentrations in agricultural soils, as stipulated in CEC directive 86/278/CEC, on the basis of the observed metal toxicity effects on soil microorganisms and soil microbial processes.  Standardization and evaluation of methods have been carried out to examine the relative toxicity to microorganisms of a range of contained soils collected from throughout Europe. Metal salt spiked soil has been used to determine the relative toxicity of metals in soils. Chemical characterization of soils from different regions of Europe has been undertaken. Solution systems have been developed for the testing of metal toxicity to isolates of soil microorganisms. The numbers of indigenous rhizobium in a number of metal contaminated soils was determined. There was some indication of a reduction in numbers with increasing soil metal content, but no large effects. Numbers of introduced rhizobium decreased with increasing soil zinc content after 18 months incubation in a gradient of metal contaminated heavy clay soils. MPN determination of rhizobium numbers indicated survival in uncontaminated soil. Methodology for the examination of rhizobium diversity has been finalized and isolations of Rhizobium made. Determination of metal tolerance of a number of species and strains of rhizobium using a water based method proved unsatisfactory. A system involving the growth of zea mays in acid washed sand was used to examine the effect of zinc, cadmium and copper on the formation of arbuscular mycorrhiza. Mycorrhizal formation was inhibited by 500 um copper; 1000 um zinc and 30 um cadmium in nutrient solution and was more sensitive than plant growth for cadmium and copper. Spore germination was examined in a soil spiked with up to 100 mg per kg{-1} of zinc. There was no inhibition of spore germination with increasing soil metal content. Sampling of respired carbon and biomass carbon indicated that any effects of environmental stress are most evident in the long term. However due to the limited buffering capacity a method of evaluating relative metal tolerance employing an ion exchanged resin was developed and evaluated. Preliminary results using the technique identified differences in the growth rate of sensitive and tolerant rhizobium strains at free cadmium concentrations as low as 1.4 ug/l. Results so far suggest that toxic effect on soil microorganisms occur in the longer term and cannot be assessed in the short term and current research addresses this. For each of the biological systems to be examined, namely Rhizobium, mycorrhiza and the functioning of the microbial biomass, there are 4 main tasks:  to develop and standardize methods for evaluating toxicity to the microorganisms in metal contaminated soils;  to develop and standardize methods for examining the relative toxicity of different metals and what concentrations are toxic (essentially laboratory based studies);  to use the methods developed in the first 2 tasks to examine toxicity to microorganisms in a range of contaminated soils in Europe;  and to evaluate the extent to which populations of microorganisms in contaminated soil have become resistant to the elevated concentrations of metals.   These main tasks will be accompanied by the following supporting activities:  provide chemical characterization of the contaminated soils;  develop solution systems for the testing of metal toxicity to isolates of soils microorganisms;  and collect contaminated soils from different regions of Europe.",1,1
262,206076,No,Peer learning on ways to enhance good practices in SME innovation support using the Seal ofExcellence,"The recent EC decision to rely on a “Seal of Excellence” to recognize Horizon 2020 proposals with outstanding (but non-funded) projects, caused significant constrains for national agencies responsible for managing Structural Funds.  To address this issue, we propose a “Peer learning on ways to enhance good practices in SME innovation support using the “Seal of Excellence” (PEER FOR EXCELLENCE)”.  PEER FOR EXCELLENCE aims to produce a Design Options Paper for the implementation of financing mechanisms (public and/or private), that will help all European, national and regional funding agencies to harness the potential of the distinction provided by the “Seal of Excellence” to successfully fund high impact innovation projects.   PEER FOR EXCELLENCE will be based in the sharing of experiences and practices analysis supported by the twinning advanced methodology. This will allow the leveraging and systematization of the knowledge, not only of the members of the consortium, but also of all of the relevant European process stakeholders.  This work will be supported by an initial assessment of existing practices in European countries, and will compare them with the ones adopted by the national/regional authorities in each of the participating countries. This comparison will be made based on both the explicit and the tacit knowledge that exists in the participating organisations, thus enabling a process of peer learning among them (and with other interested parties that have similar challenges).  The submitting organizations have a relevant stake in the national/regional funding mechanisms in their country, where they also play a significant role as host organizations of the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), supporting several SMEs that were already distinguished with the “Seal of Excellence”.

308,92642,No,Development of foods containing nanoencapsulated ingredient,"The preservation of bioactive food ingredients through product processing and storage, and their controlled release in the gastrointestinal tract is yet a major obstacle for the full exploitation of the health potential of many food bioactive components. In addition, conventional microencapsulation solutions often affect the textural sensory properties of the food. The overall objective of the NANOFOOD project is to develop and the validate the efficacy of a new generation of healthy foods based on nanocapsules technology. Tailored nanocapsules able to deliver omega-3 fatty acid and silymarin complex into the lower gut will be designed and produced by a specialized Israeli SME in collaboration with Technion, Haifa. These nanocapsules will be incorporated as bioactive ingredients into dry pasta by an Italian SME and into typical bread products by a Turkish SME. The development and characterization of these products will be supported by food scientists operating in leading research centres. Finally, the efficacy of the developed food products will be assessed by a human clinical trials on patients affected by Intestinal Bowel Disease, where the anti-inflammatory properties of the selected ingredients could be highly beneficial.

25,211844,Yes,Microclimatic buffering of plant responses to macroclimate warming in temperate forests,"Recent global warming is acting across ecosystems and threatening biodiversity. Yet, due to slow responses, many biological communities are lagging behind warming of the macroclimate (the climate of a large geographic region). The buffering of microclimates near the ground measured in localized areas, arising from terrain features such as vegetation and topography, can explain why many species are lagging behind macroclimate warming. However, almost all studies ignore the effects of microclimatic buffering and key uncertainties still exist about this mechanism. Microclimates are particularly evident in forests, where understorey habitats are buffered by overstorey trees. In temperate forests, the understorey contains the vast majority of plant diversity and plays an essential role in driving ecosystem processes.  The overall goal of FORMICA (FORest MICroclimate Assessment) is to quantify and understand the role of microclimatic buffering in modulating forest understorey plant responses to macroclimate warming. We will perform the best assessment to date of the effects of microclimates on plants by applying microtemperature loggers, experimental heating, fluorescent tubes and a large-scale transplant experiment in temperate forests across Europe. For the first time, plant data from the individual to ecosystem level will be related to microclimate along wide temperature gradients and forest management regimes. The empirical results will then be integrated in cutting-edge demographic distribution models to forecast plant diversity in temperate forests as macroclimate warms.  FORMICA will provide the first integrative study on microclimatic buffering of macroclimate warming in forests. Interdisciplinary concepts and methods will be applied, including from climatology, forestry and ecology.  FORMICA will reshape our current understanding of the impacts of climate change on forests and help land managers and policy makers to develop urgently needed adaptation strategies.",1,1
368,38267,No,POLYGLYCEROLS CHEMISTRY - ECOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS OF POLYGLYCEROL ESTERS,"Development of industrial productions on set-aside lands has encouraged non-food uses of vegetable oils such as rapeseed or sunflower. Several industrial applications are currently under development in oleochemical pla biodiesel and lubricants through esterification, soaps and surfactants through saponification or selective hydrogenation,.. Such production could be highly beneficial to Europe regarding environment impact through biodegradable renewable materials, as well as regarding landscape maintenance thanks to set-aside lands exploitation improvement of the trade balance thanks to fewer petroleum imports. As a general scheme, the valorization of a raw material reaches an optimum when secondary products are exploited. The main secondary product of oleochemistry is glycerol with a growing up contribution issued from industrial vegetable oils. Therefore, it is important, from that point of view, to find new applications for glycerol, that are worthwile regarding both market and environment impacts. Over the past years, glycerol has become an attractive raw material for the preparation of specialty products. Due to its unique structure and chemical behaviour, glycerol could potentially be used as the hydrophilic componer surfactants. Glycerol as such is not suitable as a primary constituent of the hydrophilic part of the surfactant. Furthermore hydrophobic balance of the product needs to be adjusted in order to optimize performances. To increase hydrophilicity, glycerol needs to be polymerized to polyglycerols. Conventional methods for polymerizing glycerol require drastcic process condibons including high temperature caustic content. Therefore, the molecular composition is very difficult to determine and correlations betw structure and performances cannot be established which limit the rational design of optimized structures.

899,100759,No,Engineering the POlicy-making LIfe CYcle,"The e-POLICY project presents a multi-disciplinary research effort whose goal is to support policy makers in their decision process across the engineering of a policy making life-cycle. The life-cycle integrates, in a unique way, global and individual perspectives on the decision process, bringing to the policy maker's attention both global concerns (e.g., impacts, budget constraints and objectives), and individual concerns (i.e. opinions, reactions), giving guidance towards better policy implementation strategies. An innovative game theoretical approach guides the interaction and conflict management between these two levels. In addition, the e-POLICY project proposes the evaluation of the economical, societal and environmental impacts of policy at both the global and individual levels. Societal impacts are derived from data retrieved by e-participation and Web2.0 tools. Both policy maker and citizens are assisted in the decision-making and participation processes through visualization tools. From a technological perspective, leading-edge optimization and decision support techniques contribute to global policy making, while agent-based simulation tools will perform a social simulation at the individual level, with game theory being used to manage conflicts and regulate the interaction between the two levels. Subsidiary, but no less important, techniques will aid the decision-making process by using opinion-mining from e-participation derived data and advanced visualization tools.<br/>The project proof of concept will be an open source decision support system where the above components are implemented, integrated and evaluated with a realistic target: that of a real-world regional energy plan.

230,108323,Yes,"Acquiring extremely high resolution maps of water use efficiency of Australian forests to assess the effects of drought, species composition and stand structure","Instantaneous ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of gross primary production (GPP) to evapotranspiration (ET), is an important integral trait of plant and ecosystem productivity and a key variable for modelling and understanding the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Unfortunately, the influence of climate change on ecosystem WUE is difficult to predict, because the underlying mechanisms that cause variation in ecosystem WUE are largely unknown. A major limitation so far in the research on ecosystem WUE is the current impossibility to measure WUE at sub-ecosystem (ie single tree or plant) level. The aim of this research proposal is to generate ET, GPP and WUE maps of extremely high resolution of three Australian forest biomes. The remote sensing imagery needed for this will be acquired by applying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with thermal, visual and near infrared cameras. These maps will allow us to investigate how the ET, GPP and WUE of single plants and of entire ecosystems is affected by drought, and how species composition and vegetation structure affect this relation. Two innovative new algorithms to estimate ET and GPP will be developed. These algorithms benefit from two key advantages that UAV-remote sensing offers, namely the unprecedented spatial resolution and the possibility to construct highly precise 3D maps of the canopy, thanks to the large image overlap. Measurements will be performed in three representative Australian forests, which will be monitored regularly during an entire year. Spatial and temporal analyses will be performed to assess the influence of stand structure and species contribution on GPP, ET and WUE and how these factors evolve in time, particularly during drought periods.",1,1
796,61270,No,REal COst Reduction of Door-to-door Intermodal Transport,"(RECORDIT will: 1) design a comprehensive methodology for the calculation of real (internal \external) costs of intermodal freight transport and for the understanding of cost formation mechanisms, 2) validate this methodology through its application to three meaningful European corridors (including CEEC), 3) analyse current charging and taxation systems to understand price formation mechanisms, 4) carry out a systematic cost comparison for intermodal and all-road alternatives 5) assess current imbalances and inefficiencies, 6) develop a decision support module to foster generalisation, 7) identify and analyse technical and organisational cost reduction options, 8) formulate recommendations on public policies and business actions to reduce real costs and to internalise external costs, 9) promote consensus building among operators and users, 10) disseminate project findings (2 workshops, a website). The key RECORDIT outcomes are relative to the cost analysis at corridor level and the policy simulation for reducing intermodal costs. Concerning the former outcome, the three corridors analysed are: The freight freeway between Patras - Brindisi - Milano - Munich - Hamburg and Gothenburg; The tri-modal transport chain between Genova - Basel - Rotterdam and Manchester; The door-to-door intermodal chain along the corridor Barcelona - Lyon - Torino - Verona - Budapest and Warsaw. Total internal costs for the movement of a 'Class A container' (including taxes and charges) are summarised in the table below: Corridor Intermodal All-road euro/km Genova-Manchester 1.08 1.48 Patreas-Gothenburg 0.96 1.36 Barcelona-Warsaw 1.02 1.26 The intermodal option is consistently cheaper than the all-road alternative, despite being longer. Its competitiveness is however severely undermined by the poor performance of intermodal transport in terms of trip duration, which is between 70% (Patras-Gothenburg) and 400% (Genova-Manchester) longer than for all-road. A similar comparison for marginal external costs confirms the better performance of intermodal transport. Concerning the policy options for reducing intermodal costs, the analysis is based on the identification of the most critical cost factors (drivers), and on the priority measures advocated by the White Paper, three main policy packages have been simulated with the RECORDIT DSS.  The first concentrates on the reduction of internal costs associated to terminal and transhipment operations. It features the elimination of rail-rail transhipment (interoperability), a 15% improvement of manpower productivity in terminals, and a 33% cut in capital costs. The aggregated result is a 6% reduction in total resource costs (average value for the three RECORDIT corridors).  The second scenario focuses on Pre- and Post-haulage. An optimisation of the load factor (from 60% to 90%) is the main component of this package, and yields expected savings, in terms of resource costs, evaluated in the range of 2-4% (as expected, shorter routes perform better under this scenario).  A third policy package concentrates on rail haul improvements, also with reference to the 50% reduction in rail electricity consumption advocated by the White Paper. Such an ambitious objective may be approached through a combination of measures including an increase of the number of wagons per train, a reduction in the number of stops, an increase in the load factor (up to 95%) and the generalized use of energy efficient locomotives. Altogether, this package achieves a 16% reduction in resource costs (average value between two corridors). An attempt to extrapolate these results to the Europe-wide level shows that total resource costs can be saved in the order of 82 MEuro, 173 MEuro and 59 MEuro respectively for the three scenarios, while the increase in intermodal demand induced by lower prices is estimated in 3.3, 8.5 Gtkm, and 2.4 Gtkm respectively.",0,0

A total of 29,OOO incident cases of non-fatal MI will be recruited through population registries in five European cities (Augsburg, Barcelona, Helsinki, Rome, Stockholm), and will be followed for at east one year to evaluate subsequent hospitalisation for a new MI or mortality (sudden deaths). Simultaneous measurement ofultrafine particulate matter will be conducted. The associations will be evaluated using a case-crossover approach. Since the unit of observation will be the individual, the study will be able to explore which characteristics of these patients confer major susceptibility to air pollution. A pooled analysis will be carried out. The results are relevant for European initiatives to implement targeted prevention strategies on air pollution, to release evidence-based guidelines for susceptible subgroups, and to develop dedicated early warning systems.

208,81971,Yes,"Soil C cycling and ecosystem processes: effects of plant diversity, plant community composition, N deposition and herbivory on soil C storage dynamics","Human actions are causing (1) declines in biodiversity, (2) increases in atmospheric CO2 and (3) increases in N deposition. The interactive effects of these factors and their consequences on ecosystem processes are unknown, though they play a critical role in global soil C storage dynamics. Recent data from well-replicated, long-term studies on the effects of plant diversity on both ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration show that enhanced biomass accumulation is positively related to plant diversity. Moreover, preliminary work suggests that plant species composition may be as important as species diversity in affecting soil C sequestration. Finally, biotic factors such as herbivory through indirect effects on plant roots, affect long-term fate of C and below-ground processes. Hence, the present project aims to address the effects of (1) plant diversity, (2) plant community composition, (3) N deposition, and (4) herbivory on soil C storage dynamics. The study will make use of a well-replicated, long-term study design that has been established in 1994 at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, US, as well as glasshouse experiments using isotopic techniques in the UK. Soil and plant material will be measured for C and N. Data on plant productivity, N mineralization rat es, C:N ratios, and nitrogen use efficiency will be collected according to different treatments. The research project is the first, to our knowledge, to test the effects of varying biodiversity, species functional composition and N fertilization on soil C storage dynamics at the ecosystem-scale being part of a well-replicated, long-term factorial grassland biodiversity experiment. Therefore, the overall results of the study will contribute to the important ongoing scientific research, which focuses on the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, with a particular bias towards those mechanisms involved in the global C storage dynamics.",1,1

105,11972,Yes,ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION AND FOREST DECLINE IN THE FRENCH MOUNTAINS,"TO IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRATED AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PROGRAMME ON FOREST DECLINE IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE OTHER SPECIALIZED EUROPEAN RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.  The French programme Deperissement des Forets et Pollution Atmospherique (DEFORPA) was set up to study the different possible causes of the forest decline, including atmospheric pollution. The studies consisted in field measurements of air pollutants and investigations on the mechanism of formation and deposition of pollutants.  Research was carried out on the following: measurements of air pollution levels in the Vosges mountains; mechanism of formation and deposition of pollutants in the Vosges mountains (involving local levels of ozone and peroxyacylnitrate (PAN) in air and deposition of small particles on a forested surface); meso scale modelling of sulphur dioxide sulphuric acid conversion in cloudy air masses.  The research carried out on atmospheric pollution in the Vosges mountains within the DEFORPA programme indicated that this region is strongly influenced by polluted air masses coming from North and East industrialized and urban areas. The role of atmospheric pollution on forest decline in the Vosges mountains could not be firmly established. It was only stated that the seasonal high concentrations of ozone observed may produce physiological troubles to vegetation.

7,209217,Yes,Rol of obligate bacterial symbiosis in the diversification of a globally distributed aphid genus,"Plant-feeding insects represent a significant part of earth biodiversity but also encompass many plant pests that cause major losses to agricultural crops. One key factor in their evolutionary success probably resides in the mutualistic associations they have established with bacteria that reside in their cells. These endosymbionts metabolize some of the nutrients lacking in their host diet and can be essential for successfully shifting to new ecological niches. However, intracellular lifestyle also often results in severe genomic erosion for endosymbionts that limits their metabolic versatility and in fine affects their host adaptive potential. In this project we aim at deciphering the role of bacterial endosymbiosis in the long-term evolution of plant-feeding insects. The main question we want to address is whether the evolution of obligate bacterial endosymbionts played a significant role in the diversification (speciation and extinction) of their hosts. Using the genome sequences of the main bacterial endosymbionts associated with a globally distributed aphid genus, we will: 1) reconstruct the history of aphid/symbiont associations by conducting phylogenomic analyses; 2) identify the footprint of selection and genetic drift in bacterial genomes by comparing patterns of molecular evolution within and between symbiotic bacterial lineages; 3) illuminate how changes in the endosymbiont community metabolic capabilities have accompanied aphids evolutionary transitions (host plant shifts, climatic tolerance, rates of speciation) using phylogenetic comparative methods. Using the data from an ongoing large sequencing project, this project will combine recent methods in phylogenomics, metabolic network analyses and the study of macroevolutionary processes. With this fellowship, the applicant will lead an exciting and innovative multidisciplinary project, supervised by international experts in microbial evolutionary genomics and insect macroevolution; this project will cre",1,1
253,96342,No,Structural and functional insight into the biosynthesis of endogenous lipidic messengers by the N-Acyl Phosphatidylethanolamine Phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD),"Imbalances of human major lipid signaling pathways contribute to progression in inflammation, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Among lipidic messengers, the family of bioactive N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) is agonist at cannabinoid and nuclear α-type peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The ability of NAEs and their metabolic enzymes to modulate neurotransmission and a variety of pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, appetite, pain and mood, provides unique chances for drug discovery. Upon stimulation, bioactive NAEs are generated from cell membranes in a two-step pathway, which involves an N-acyltransferase and an N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). NAEs bearing saturated and monounsaturated long acyl chains are significantly decreased in NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice suggesting this enzymes as  key regulators of the NAE-mediated signaling potential. Very little is known about the molecular architecture of NAPE-PLD and the specific functional role of its N- and C-terminal domains. If given a chance, I will study domain trafficking in activated cells and to solve the X-ray structure of this membrane-bound protein. I will characterize the thermodynamics and kinetics of enzyme interactions, which are essential in understanding how NAPE-PLD synthesizes NEAs and controls their cellular level. Findings will be used for a rational approach in the design of potent and selective NAPE-PLD ligands, which can be exploited pharmacologically to modulate the level of NAEs in inflammation, pain, and neurodegenerative disorders. These aims are a common goal of cell biology, structural biology, pharmacology, and medicinal chemistry, which could give an invaluable blueprint for the design of selective inhibitors, thus strongly impacting both EU scientific research and EU molecular medicine. The Drug Discovery and Development Unit of the Italian Institute of Technology is a unique working environment for their achievement.",0,0
295,198366,No,Compact REtrofit Advanced Thermal Energy storage,"The CREATE project aims to tackle the thermal energy storage challenge for the built environment by developing a compact heat storage. This heat battery allows for better use of available renewables in two ways: 1) bridging the gap between supply and demand of renewables and 2) increasing the efficiency in the energy grid by converting electricity peaks into stored heat to be used later, increasing the energy grid flexibility and giving options for tradability and economic benefits.  The main aim of CREATE is to develop and demonstrate a heat battery, ie an advanced thermal storage system based on Thermo-Chemical Materials, that enables economically affordable, compact and loss-free storage of heat in existing buildings. The CREATE concept is to develop stabilized storage materials with high storage density, improved stability and low price, and package them in optimized heat exchangers, using optimized storage modules. Full scale demonstration will be done in a real building, with regulatory/normative, economic and market boundaries taken into account. To ensure successful exploitation, the full knowledge, value, and supply chain are mobilized in the present consortium. It will be the game changer in the transformation of our existing building stock towards near-zero energy buildings.

225,213923,Yes,Spurring INnovations for Forest ECosystem SERvices in Europe,"One of the major challenges relating to the management of Europe’s forests is to balance the provision of distinct forest ecosystem services with broad societal demands. If markets and existing governance arrangements fail, forest owners and managers struggle to meet societal needs. There is a necessity to explore new approaches to connect profitable forest management with changing societal demands. Against this background, innovative mechanisms (IM), including novel policies and business models, have the potential to align ecosystem services supply and demand. SINCERE will, first, systematically map the existing knowledge and practical experiences with IM at the European scale. Second, it will, in a joint effort of practice partners and researchers, design, implement and subsequently evaluate a complementary set of innovation actions that explore novel IM in different regional contexts. These actions encompass a broad spectrum of forest ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity, climate change mitigation, water supply, recreation), governance mechanisms (e.g. new business models, ‘reverse auctions’ with forest owners, participatory governance) and regional settings (e.g. intensively managed commercial forests in Finland versus little-managed forest land in Spain). Third, a Learning Architecture will connect these innovation actions across countries to incentivize cross-case fertilization and learning between research and practice. Finally, practice partners, policy makers and researchers will jointly draw lessons learnt from the innovation actions, including the upscaling of successful IM to be replicated elsewhere. The project will also push for innovations at the interface between policies and on-the-ground IM, and will deliver concrete suggestions for a coordinated European policy framework that supports IM. Target group-specific communication and dissemination activities will ensure SINCERE’s impact throughout the entire project duration.",1,1
959,34188,No,"European network of excellence in computational logic, Compulog net iii","The aim of the network is to support all phases of technological change associated with the research, development and application of logic-based techniques and methods in all areas of computing.  The research fields of Compulog Net encompass every aspect of computational logic, though special emphasis is currently placed on: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning; Concurrent and Constraint Logic Programming; Logic-Based Databases; Program Development; Language Design, Semantics and Verification Methods; Implementation Technology and Parallelism; Automated Deduction Systems; (Computational Logic and) Machine Learning; (Computational Logic and) Natural Language Processing; Spatial and Temporal Reasoning.  Logic-based approaches to computing have a vast potential for industrial exploitation and are currently applied in such diverse sectors as manufacturing, engineering, transportation, distribution, telecommunications, banking, finance, insurance, data management and medicine, as witnessed by numerous case-studies presented at the network's industrial seminars, at network sponsored conferences such as the Practical Applications of Prolog (PAP), the Practical Applications of Constraint Technology (PACT), as well as at the Japanese Symposium and Exhibition on Industrial Applications of Prolog (INAP).  The network is structured into three distinct but interrelated frameworks:   - Research Co-ordination; - Industrial Action; - Education and Training;  together with a fourth framework supporting each of the others:   - Information and Infrastructure. - Research Co-ordination is supported by the activities of Research Area Coordinators for each of the Areas mentioned above. These include the organisation of technical meetings and workshops, support for related events and conferences, and information collection and dissemination. The number of Research Areas has been increased, to give the network a broader scope and to promote newly-emerging areas with high potential for industrial exploitation. Some of the new Areas are to be jointly coordinated with other Networks of Excellence. - Within the framework of Industrial Action a programme of activities is carried out jointly with industrial nodes, software developers and vendors, and includes conferences, workshops and special industrial seminars. Industrial Task Forces and Special Industrial Interest Groups help to identify industrial needs and to focus reactive research and technological development. - Education and Training coordinates and promotes the training and mobility of researchers within the network using schemes such as TMR. It is planned to set-up distributed Masters and PhD programmes in Computational Logic, which will make use of both advanced distance-teaching methods and equipment as well as student visits to network nodes. A section of the annual European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information is co-organised and supported by the network, to provide further opportunities for acquiring skills and training. - Infrastructure and Information provides the essential communication frameworks for rapid information dissemination and exchange, efficient co-ordination, as well as environments to sustain remote computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) between nodes of the network. Major nodes will be equipped with advanced CSCW workstations to enable video conferencing, advanced communication, cooperative work and information exchange.",0,0
752,102102,No,European Multicentre Tics in Children Studies,"This project will undertake pre-clinical and cohort studies that address susceptibility factors for paediatric and adolescent tic disorders, with a particular focus on comorbid obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, from clinical, epidemiological, genetic, microbiological and immunological angles. EMTICS aims to elucidate the complex aetiology of the onset and clinical course of chronic tic disorders and associated obsessive-compulsive symptoms, through disentangling the interplay between environmental factors and genetic background; translate research findings into clinical applications by developing disease prediction models and investigation of a treatment strategy; and will establish a Pan-European infrastructure for the study of tic disorders. We hypothesise that the onset and/or exacerbation of tic and comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorders is associated with increased preceding occurrence of Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) infections of specific molecular subtypes, and that this association is based on genetic susceptibility factors and mediated through immunological mechanisms related to psychosocial stress and immunological factors in host and GAS strains. Large-scale cohort studies will involve affected patients and at-risk first-degree relatives within an integrated, multidisciplinary research strategy. Treatment effects of active surveillance and standardized antibiotic treatment of GAS colonisation, thus addressing one of the main environmental factors involved (GAS infections) will be evaluated. Our approach will result in the identification of genetic and environmental susceptibility factors and will greatly contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tic disorders, with a focus on elucidating the role of autoimmunity. Our consortium brings together the highest expertise in the field of tic disorders across Europe in academia and industry, including a number of SMEs and a professional management company.",0,0
686,210956,No,"Combining wood and polymers to produce a translucent, reinforced and ecological material","The project POLYWOOD (Combining wood and polymers to produce a translucent, reinforced and ecological material) is mono-partner, lead by French startup WOODOO, and responds to the call topic “Coordination and support actions, H2020 SME Innovation Associate”. WOODOO has developed a breakthrough patented technology, focusing on wood modification at the cellular and molecular scale. It starts from native wood, removing lignin and impregnating the cellulosis matrix with selected monomers, polymerizing in situ to create much stronger bonds between the wood native fibers. The result is a translucent wood, three times stiffer than natural wood, much more durable, water and fire resistant. Research has been done before on de-lignification and on the monomeric impregnation of wood, but never have they been combined in the way WOODOO does, with a direct and highly promising application potential across various industries. The industrial development of this process could establish Europe as a world leader on the market of bio-based materials. In alignment with the new EU forest strategy (EC, 2013), WOODOO will help unfold the potential of the European forest. This bio-based, low-carbon material will help tackle the urgent need of lowering the carbon footprint in the building industry. WOODOO offers a 12 month position to a European material science researcher, with a strong knowledge of functional monomers, wood structure, and industrial processes, in order to reach its next objective: bringing the technology from the lab to the market. The research associate will take full advantage of WOODOO international team, as well a use an occasion to show polyvalence, leadership and commitment in the exciting environment of a booming startup, awarded with multiple innovation awards. The POLYWOOD total grant request to the EC is 79 375 € and the total eligible project budget is of equal amount. The project will be conducted over 12 months in close alignment with the overall WOODOO needs",0,0
708,102323,No,In vivo dynamics of antibody responses to lymph-borne viruses,"Objective. Our objective is to elucidate how neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against live viruses are generated in vivo within lymph nodes (LNs). To this end we will make use of state-of-the-art imaging technology (i.e. multiphoton intravital microscopy [MP-IVM]), fluorescent replication-competent viruses and dedicated mouse models. Background/Rationale. nAbs are critical for virus control, prevention of re-infection and protection conferred by available vaccines. Thanks to the recent advent of MP-IVM, several cellular and molecular events by which LNs orchestrate humoral immune responses have been clarified. As none of these studies employed live viruses, further work is required to extend these results to a more relevant natural setting. Also, the mechanisms by which cytopathic viruses (e.g. rabies virus in humans and vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] in mice) induce early high affinity nAb responses while non-cytopathic viruses (e.g. hepatitis C virus in humans and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV] in mice) fail to do so remain poorly understood. Our rationale is based on the notion that, by bringing together unique reagents and advanced technology, we can - at last - address these issues experimentally. Description of the project. The spatial and temporal constraints whereby virus-specific naïve B cells encounter viral antigen, interact with different LN cells and differentiate into plasma cells will be dynamically dissected in the various LN sub-compartments of mice infected with live cytopathic (VSV) and non-cytopathic (LCMV) viruses. Anticipated output. We will provide the first complete in vivo imaging survey of virus-specific B cell activation, from the first minutes of viral entry into LNs to the generation of high affinity nAb-secreting cells. We will also identify virus-induced mechanisms interfering with nAb responses. This new knowledge will provide insight into aspects of viral immunity that may lead to novel rational vaccine strategies.",0,0
780,57459,No,Testebed for a Worldwide Agent Network,"Agentcities NET will create an open dynamic service environment based on Agent technology by supporting users wishing to deploy agent platforms and services that connect to an extensible Internet based testbed. The project will also enable technology transfer by bringing together key players from related industries (potential users of the technology) and those developing testbed infrastructure and services - potential technology providers but also early take up users - with the testbed as a focal point for collaborative work. The trial will open to encourage Europe-wide participation and has over 40 pre-registered contributors. Concretely, the trial will involve a set of coordinated 'actions', designed to support these activities: information days, a deployment support program, a competition, student exchange support and focused working groups.  Objectives: The primary objectives of this project are: I) creation of a Europe-wide, extensible, open testbed network of agent platforms, to enable users to connect up their own systems at will to grow the network and begin to explore the potential of the technology, 2) support technology transfer by facilitating discussion, input and feedback on all aspects (technical, scientific, legal, business) of the evolving open network.  The project expects to produce a valuable public resource for agent research and pre-competitive commercial exploitation, bring together key players from related industries (tool vendors, hosting services, portals, e-commerce solution providers, content providers).  Work description: The project will work closely with an associated project Agentcities.RTD (Proposal number IST-2000-28385) which will develop a backbone of 14 Agent platforms worldwide. This project will build on the Agentcities.RTD effort to enable other users to extend and exploit the initial backbone.  Concretely the trial will be based on a series of actions: 1. Information days: providing for quick and easy access to testbed developments. 2. A deployment support programme: supporting new users deploying network nodes. 3. A competition aspect: to encourage the development of innovative new services. 4. A student exchange programme: to support short collaborative projects and begin/support the process of education required for take up of a new technology. 5. Focused working groups: supporting discussion and feedback channels for users and technology suppliers in selected testbed issues.  To enable Europe-wide take up, a fundamental aspect of the trial will be its openness with interested parties able to join and contribute throughout the lifetime of the project. Members joining the trial will be able to participate in actions active in the project. It is worth noting that the member interest and support is world-wide with a central core from Europe.  Milestones: The project is expected to have the following results: 1) a live testbed with an active user group providing real utility in research and commercial testing/exploratory projects - with the possibility the environment will evolve to supporting commercial services, 2) significant technology transfer between technology suppliers, universities and users to proactively advance the European commercial activity for incorporation of related technologies and results into future products and services.",0,0
561,55446,No,Transmitter integration of next generation TETRA systems for PMR and public safety applications in a CMOS-based SiGe technology,"The objective of this proposal is the development of the first 800-900 MHz integrated TETRA transmitter using SiGe technology. TETRA trunked radio systems are being implemented in the 380-430 MHz frequency spectrum within Europe. Driven by cost, technical and size considerations integration of transmitter functions via Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) onto Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) using BiCMOS technology is occurring. Future European TETRA capacity requirements will not be met by the current frequency allocations, allocations that are not available/already allocated to other services outside Europe. Frequencies between 800-900 MHz are more common worldwide. Within Europe, National administrations are reviewing the availability of 800-900 MHz spectrum.
