529,222714,No,The Visual Politics of Recognition: Understanding the Role of Images in Recognition Encounters,"Images are an important component of recognition between states: official photographs of high-level summit meetings, or images circulated by state representatives over Twitter, are used to visualise positive or negative interstate relationships that reflect, or challenge, established recognition dynamics. Despite the political importance of recognition, there are currently no studies on the visual politics of this process in International Relations. The purpose of the VISUAL project is to take the field a step further through the development of an innovative and original typology for the visual politics of recognition.   In VISUAL we have the unique opportunity to advance our knowledge of the role images play in global politics. Using a theoretically-driven, exploratory analytical methodology employing a mixed-methods approach, the project theorizes and conceptualises successful and failed recognition by situating images within a process we know is politically significant: EU, NATO and G7 summit meetings and the acrimonious Iran-US relationship. In addition hereto, VISUAL explores the role of gender in the visual politics of recognition, developing a feminist visual methodology, the first of its kind in International Relations. Using the 'case plus study' methodology, VISUAL will address three main research questions across three sub-studies: 1) What are the visual modalities of recognition, successful and failed? 2) How are rival interpretations of recognition in the Iran-US relationship visualised? 3) How are gender norms reproduced or challenged in images signifying successful or failed recognition?  I will significantly benefit from a placement at the Department of Political Science at the University of Copenhagen, under the supervision of Professor Lene Hansen, as it is the premiere international institution for the theoretical and empirical study of images in the field of International Relations.",0,0
421,43535,No,Chronic microvascular disease in the brain and mechanisms of age related functional impairments,"Objectives:  The project would test the following hypotheses concerning the mechanisms leading to deve!opment of leukoaraiosis:  1. Leukoaraiosis results from diffuse decreases in subcortical capillary density that lead to chronic subcortical ischaemia.  2. Axonal damage or loss is a major cause of the chronic functional impairments associated with leukoaraiosis  3. Microvascular disease leading to leukoaraiosis is associated both with altered coupling of local haemodynamic responses to neuronal activation and with altered functional connectivities between cortical networks activated during cognitive tasks.  Chronic microvascular disease of the brain is a major cause of motor impairment and dementia with aging. Early diagnosis and treatment have been limited by the lack of reliablenon-invasive markers of disease. Although widespread periventricular white matter changes described as leukoaraiosis are characteristic of the MRI brainscans of affected individuals, the significance of these changes is uncertain, as they also can be found with apparently healthy aging. Such variable severity of clinical deficits associated with similar appearances by conventional imaging must reflect considerable pathological heterogeneity underlying the changes of leukoaraiosis. This proposal would link expertise in four European research centres for the coordinated application of positron emission tomooraphy (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) for better characterisation of the pathophysiology of aging-related chronic microvascular disease of the brain. The healthy aging patients with leukoaraiosis with or without dementia and patients with chronic hypertension who are at risk of developing leukoaraisosis would be studied. Correlations would be made between neuroimaging measures and clinically-relevant functional impairments.  The project would test the following hypotheses concerning the mechanisms leading to development of leukoaraosis: 1. Leukoaraiosis results from diffuse decreases in subcortical capillary density that lead to chronic subcortical ischaemia; 2. Axonal damage or loss is a major cause of the chronic functional impairments associated with leukoaraiosis; 3. Microvascular disease leading to leukoaraiosis is associated both with altered coupling of local haemodvnamic responses to neuronal activation and with altered functional connectivity between cortical networks activated during cognitive tasks.  In the course of our work we would assess whether PET or advanced MR techniques could be used as sensitive and specific surrogate markers for monitoring the progression of this disease process. Availability of such markers would provide a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of drug development studies and for assessment of the risks of disability from this disease. By working together, the project partners would be able to integrate clinical data and technical expertise to an extent not possible in any single European centre. The partnership would enhance research training, particularly in the areas of neuroimaging and image analysis. Positive results from the work would encourage the dissemination of sophisticated new brain imaging technologies currently being developed and marketed by major European industries.05 05",0,0
63,80062,Yes,Fostering the public debate on university support of female scientists to start a business,"Entrepreneurship now enters European universities through curricula and start-up support systems. Women represent around 50% of students at universities but are very much un-represented in terms of scientific or entrepreneurial careers. Which specific problems prevent women in science choosing this career? Why are entrepreneurship support structures in universities unable to encourage women to think about an entrepreneurial career?  FemStart aims to foster public debate on this issue based on the experience of the EU Network ProWomEn, which investigated the promotion of women entrepreneurship in general but could not consider the issue of women scientists starting a business in detail. Public debate on women entrepreneurship is very controversial as common opinion is that there is no need for special support structures for women. But statistics on the number of women starting a company or receiving start-up support show a vast under-representation of women compared to their part in the working world and similarly for women in science and female scientists starting a company.  Research on these issues gives clear evidence that women do need special encouragement and are a target group for specific support measures to get involved in entrepreneurship. By organising a series of events at 6 universities in different European regions (South Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Latvia, Poland and Romania), FemStart will start a debate by inviting experts on entrepreneurship support and education, public body representatives and administrations from the local regions and nearby countries and regions.  Female scientists will be invited as well as male representatives from the university and public/private sectors. FemStart will raise awareness for the issue, deliver good practices and allow discussion among experts and non-experts on how to adapt existing measures to integrate women scientists in entrepreneurship support actions at universities better.",1,1
566,108491,No,"Material cultures of care and emotion in Britain and Spain, 1890-1940","It is widely recognised, both within and outside the medical professions, that the huge advances in bio-medical science experienced during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have risked reducing medicine to an impersonal and mechanistic discipline, in which treatment is reduced to set of pharmaceutical and surgical interventions which pay not attention to the patient’s personality and cultural context. There has been a concerted attempt in recent medical practice to counteract that reductive tendency, and to recognise the importance of treating the whole person, including their mind and their emotions, and to pay attention to the physical and cultural environment as an intrinsic part of medical treatment. These ideas about ‘care’ more broadly conceived all have historical precedents, and it is the aim of the proposed research project to uncover some of them and to think about their relevance both to contemporary practice and to our understanding of the past. The project aims to reconstitute the affective lives of both patients and care-givers through an analysis of the material cultures, physical spaces, and culture representations that were involved in creating their experiences. It is thus aims to use a comparative cultural history of care as a way to enrich our historical understandings of the spaces, objects, and emotions involved in producing health and disease in the modern world.",0,0

Expected Outcome  * A greater understanding of the full range of benefits that health systems can and do produce, the relative importance given to each, and how much peoples' assessment of what is important for a health system to produce varies between different population subgroups.  * An indication of the areas where health systems in developing countries are failing to produce the benefits expected of them by the population, and whether governments' or donors' objectives in health sector reform programmes accurately reflect the expressed desires of the population.  * Development of techniques for measuring the full range of benefits produced by health systems including methods to enable different forms of utility to be weighed against one another.  * A test of the applicability of these new techniques as means to measure and monitor the health system performance of different countries, health systems or regions within countries in terms of the utility they generate.  * A test of the applicability of these new techniques to the development of policies which will maximise aggregate health system utility. * Ten focus group discussions, two in each of the countries (Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica) interviewing extremely diverse socio-economic groups of different age and sex composition as to the different forms of utility that they currently obtain from the health system in their country, and other forms of utility that they are not currently obtaining, or would like to gain to a greater extent.  * Quantitative surveys in each of the five developing countries to determine the relative importance given to the different forms of health service-derived utility identified through activity 1.   * Document review and semi-structured interview with key informants to determine the stated and unstated aims of health sector reform programmes and their relative priorities.  * Analytical desk-work contrasting the implications of results from activities 2 and 3 in terms of the congruence or incompatibility of government and donor policy objectives for the health sector with the desires of the population as a whole and certain key subgroups within it (the poor, women, ethnic minorities etc.).  * Series of pre-tests and pilot studies to identify a set of objective and subjective indicators which can be used to obtain quantitative measurements of the extent to which the major forms of health system-derived utility are being produced by the health sector. Analysis to assess the consistency and validity of these various indicators.  * Experimentation with trade-off, willingness to pay, standard gamble and other methods for measuring utility, in order to develop a technique which would enable the indicators developed in activity 5 to be weighted so that their sum provides a valid composite index of total health system-derived utility.  * Application of the utility measurement and weighing techniques developed in activities 5 and 6 to the definition of a 'basic package' of health services which when provided by the public sector would maximise total health system-derived utility. This will be done by in-depth interviews with the 10 different social groups identified in activity 1. The composition of such a package will be compared and contrasted with other existing or proposed packages defined by policy-makers or technicians seeking to maximise health gain.  * Application of the utility measurement and weighing techniques developed in activities 5 and 6 to a quantitative assessment of the aggregate health system-derived utility for a defined population within each of the five developing countries participating in the study. This would entail a population-based survey using a structured questionnaire.",0,0
697,197099,No,Defining hormonal cross-talk and the role of mutations in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer,"Estrogen Receptor (ER) is the driving transcription factor in ~75% of all breast cancers. ER antagonists are routinely used for treatment, but significant variability exists in clinical response. We are interested in explaining this heterogeneity and exploiting the mechanistic insight. We have recently identified important, but previously uncharacterised cross-talk between ER and the progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways, both of which are commonly expressed in ER\ tumours. Recently, ER has been shown to be mutated in ~18-55% of metastatic breast cancers. In addition, two key ER-chromatin regulatory proteins, FoxA1 and GATA3, are mutated in primary ER\ disease. Finally we have discovered three previously unknown phosphorylation events on FoxA1.   Aim 1: We will comprehensively explore the cross-talk that exists between ER and PR and AR pathways to determine the physiological effects on ER function. Aim 2: We will recapitulate the key mutations observed in ER, FoxA1 and GATA3, to assess the impact on ER-DNA interactions, ER transcriptional activity and cell growth and drug response. This will be explored under different hormonal contexts to identify how the mutational spectrum influences the cross-talk between ER and the parallel PR and AR pathways. Aim 3: We will identify upstream kinase pathways that influence FoxA1 and GATA3 function. Aim 4: We will establish a novel single locus chromatin purification method for isolation of specific chromatin loci, followed by Mass Spectrometry to characterise the potential role of PR and AR variants and to identify unknown regulatory factors.   Given recent biological discoveries and technological advances, we are perfectly positioned to apply cutting-edge tools to glean mechanistic insight into the factors that determine variability within ER\ disease. This proposal aims to advance our understanding of ER\ tumour heterogeneity, revealing ways of exploiting this in a clinically meaningful manner.",0,0
905,109452,No,CONnecting EXcellence to UC3M,"The Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) proposes a new fellowship programme for incoming mobility, called CONEX - CONnecting EXcellence to UC3M. The main objective of CONEX is to provide excellent training and career development opportunities to researchers, so that funded researchers can make significant steps in their scientific careers. Through CONEX, researchers who are not resident in Spain are enabled to carry out extended periods of research in one of UC3M’s research institutes or research groups. Following 2 calls for proposals, the CONEX programme aims to offer 8 fellowships with a duration of 36 months to Very Experienced Professors (>10 years research experience) and 20 fellowships with a duration of 36 months to Experienced Professors (4 – 10 years research experience). Researchers are fully free in the choice of their research topic, institute and supervisor/mentor, to allow for a maximum benefit of the fellowship on their career development. To support the researchers in their career advancement, all researchers will have a supervisor or mentor and are required to set up and evaluate a Personal Career Development Plan. An ethical issues policy is put in place, in line with the FP7 rules on ethical issues. The evaluation is based on a peer-review process. The evaluation process and criteria are transparent and are communicated to the applicants through openly accessible applicant’s documentation and support mechanisms. The CONEX Programme is complementary to and coherent with other UC3M supported initiatives that currently facilitate mobility. CONEX is also expected to have positive effects on UC3M, in particular through its policy of ‘Concentrating talent’ and on the Spanish landscape in general. CONEX supports the objectives of the activity heading Life-long learning and Career Development and other European policies, such as the Innovation Union.",0,0
938,102499,No,How force regulates cell function: a molecular and cellular outlook,"Force is ubiquitous in nature and physical stimuli are crucial for cell function. How cells process forces determines key physiological processes such as cell growth and differentiation, in which cells divide or differentiate according to the chemical and physical cues cells receive from the extracellular matrix. Physical stimuli have also been involved in the development of pathological processes, especially those in which cells lose the proper physical communication with the environment, such as cancer and metastasis formation. The major components of the mechanotransduction signaling pathways that transmit and translate these physical messages will most likely to be the molecules that directly sense force from the extracellular matrix. These molecules are integrins and the proteins that link them to the cytoskeleton. Here, I propose a multidisciplinary approach aimed to elucidate how force can modulate cellular behaviour. The project will focus on (i) determining how cells sense, produce and interpret forces and (ii) the cellular outcomes resulting from these processes. First, a nanotechnological suite composed of magnetic tweezers, and siRNA technology will be developed and employed to determine the roles of the molecules involved in these mechanical pathways. Second, the molecular mechanisms that trigger the interaction of proteins under force application will be studied. Several biophysical techniques such as magnetic tweezers, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF), and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) will be used here. Finally, a comparative study of the effect of force in normal and malignant cells will be accomplished. It will be tested whether or not these pathways are involved in the expression of genes in the nucleus, and the ability of normal and malignant cells to respond to external forces and to apply forces on their substrates. Magnetic tweezers, and elastic pillars will be used here.",0,0

This effort should ultimately lead to improved mother and child health and better control of sexual transmitted diseases. The proposal is therefore structured in seven work packages:  1. Management and coordination 2. Maternal & newborn health research 3. STI research 4. HPV research 5. Antibiotic resistance 6. Public Health and Social Health Protection 7. Clinical, epidemiological and public health research  This project will brings partners together from Europe, Morocco and South Africa that have common research interests but that work in very different settings. Several partners have already been collaborating with each other but mainly on an ad hoc basis and not as a network:  1. The International Health Research Centre of Barcelona (CRESIB), Spain 2. The Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp, Belgium 3. University Mohamed V Soussi – Rabat, Morocco 4. University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah of Fez, Morocco 5.

University of Southampton, United Kingdom 9. The Bordeaux School of Public Health (ISPED), University Bordeaux Segalen, France  For European researchers and professionals, the interaction with Moroccan and South African national health systems and research groups can contribute to a better understanding of common health challenges, including health related topics with human mobility and migrations between both continents and access to care for migrant groups in Europe. This collaboration involving several high profile groups (Europe, Morocco, South Africa) strengthens a global perspective on key maternal, newborn and reproductive health topics.'""",0,1
990,44468,No,Interactive total support and guidance for effective management of health and safety in manufacturing smes,"The aim of the ITSAFE project is to develop a practical software-based toolset to support daily management of health and safety management in small companies, and thereby improve their health and safety performance. Health and safety issues are very important to many small companies, as the costs due to inadequate health and safety management can be very large. It is estimated that losses due to inadequate health and safety management in Europe are over 10 billion ECU per year. In response, the EU and member state government agencies have greatly increased the amount of legislation, guidelines and regulations on health and safety. SMEs have to comply with the legislation as do larger companies, but without the depth of resources, which causes a lot of problems. SMEs need a practical set of tools to cope with the health and safety management and help them to comply with legislation. The results of the project will be a software-based toolset which will fully support the operational management of an effective health and safety management system. This will bring with it, benefits of a structured approach to health and safety management, more efficient working and access to the most up-to-date relevant health and safety information. The ITSAFE toolset will comprise an simple enterprise description module and health and safety planner to assist SMEs in setting up an efficient health and safety system. SMEs will be able to document their procedures and guidelines using the ITSAFE system. Having done this, they will be able to monitor the health and safety activities and ensure that personnel are correctly trained for the health and safety tasks which they have to perform. ITSAFE will also have an up-to-date health and safety reference model, consisting of the EU and national regulations and containing all the sector-relevant further legislation and guidelines. The SMEs will therefore have a one-source access to the health and safety information they need. The results will also include a guidance module which will provide on-line assistance for all of the daily health and safety management tasks. Benefits will be that small companies would be able to manage their Health and safety procedures better. This will provide benefits to the workforce in terms of safer and better working conditions. The companies would also benefit in taking less risks in terms of prosecutions and the potential major costs of inadequate health and safety. The project participants will cooperate with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and will disseminate the results of the project widely. This project has substantial potential in the extremely important area of health and safety. The project partners will cooperate to produce a marketable product and will jointly exploit the results of the project during the post-project commercialisation.",0,0
526,104346,No,"The Development of Cypriot Greek in Individuals with Down Syndrome: Their Morphosyntactic profile, and the effects of Phonetics and Phonology","This project investigates the developmental grammar of Cypriot Greek in young individuals with Down Syndrome (CG-DS) and in children with typical language development (CG-TLD) in three specific areas: tense, agreement, and case. Similarities and differences will be compared between the two populations to determine whether DS presents acquisition stages parallel to TLD (but delayed), or whether it presents a fundamentally different development. Previous work has shown that before fully acquiring a language, children with TLD across languages are able to use only certain aspects of grammar at various stages of their language acquisition process. For example, in early development they have been argued to have an under-specified tense feature and use infinitives in environments where tensed verbs are required. A parallel stage was proposed with atypical populations like Specific Language Impairment or DS, who experience the same phenomenon though at an older age. In the only existing study on language abilities in CG-DS, it was shown that adult CG-DS and 7- to 8-year-old CG-TLD frequently perform similarly with regards to tense, agreement, and case with accuracy rates over 95%. The linguistic differences (i.e. consonant & word omissions and production of different inflectional features than those targeted) are not due to a syntactic impairment, as previously suggested for English DS. Instead, differences lie in articulatory restrictions, and use of default features rather than the targeted ones. This study will provide information on the stages of language acquisition in CG-TLD and CG-DS, with specific reference to tense, agreement, and case — the first study of its kind, for CG and beyond. Therefore, this project constitutes innovative research with regard to different stages of (a)typical language development in CG. We further aim to provide sufficient information for therapists for the development of new tools to improve linguistic performance in populations with DS.",0,0

898,214322,No,Bringing a health claim to information: Measuring the impact of health data on the health outcomes of European citizens,"European Union Members States (EU-MS) share similar levels of development and access to care. Yet, key population health indicators vary widely across countries. The societal burden of these inequalities is high, and leveraging evidence to achieve better health outcomes is a priority. Within countries, Health Information Systems (HIS) are the cornerstone of public health interventions. In Europe however, health surveillance data are fragmented: EU-MS report different items to different international data collection exercises; there is variation between countries with regard to the amount of data collected, how it is generated, and its quality; and there are gaps in information. Whereas we have good mortality data, we are weak on morbidity data, on the quality of care for chronic conditions, and on evaluating patients’ experiences of disease. Overall, there is heterogeneity in the level of evidence that can be used by key stakeholders and in specific health-domains; and we do not know the extent to which differences in health information (HI) capacity might influence on the population burden of disease. This post-doctoral project aims to provide a “HI Impact Index” that could be used by EU public health agencies and policy planners to measure the uptake of evidence into policies and care, and ultimately their impact on population health overall and in priority areas for Europe: maternal and child health, chronic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, injury prevention, and patient reported outcomes and experiences. The research will be hosted at the Belgian Federal Research Institute for Public Health under the supervision of Professor Herman Van Oyen, coordinator of the upcoming European Joint Action on Health Information.

494,212763,No,"Genetic, behavioural and cognitive mechanisms underpinning the association between mother and offspring mental health problems: mental (M) health (H) intergenerational transmission (INT) -(MHINT)","Despite decades of research, and the introduction of parenting interventions, children of mentally ill mothers remain substantially more likely to have mental health problems themselves. I propose to shed new light on why mental health problems in a mother are passed on to her child, and help break this reinforcing cycle of mental health risk across generations. In order to harness the potential of modifying parenting for the prevention of child mental health risk, I will study parenting using more detailed, ecologically valid and genetically sensitive designs than have been done before. Objectives: 1: To investigate the respective role of genetic and environmental (chiefly parenting) mechanisms in explaining associations between mother and child mental health. HOW: using a consortium of international cohorts with intergenerational genetic and phenotypic data (n>10,000) and, for the first time, modeling genetic risk which is and is not transmitted from mother to child to test alternative hypotheses. 2: To identify behavioural manifestation of maternal mental health, in observed mother-infant interaction, in an ecologically valid way. HOW: recording 300 mother- child dyads at home, using novel wearable cameras, in the next generation of a key cohort (ALSPAC-G2). 3: To identify cognitive underpinnings of maternal behaviour. HOW: including cognitive tasks (with eye tracking) as new measures in ALSPAC-G2, applying computational models to cognitive and (uniquely) real life data (measured in 2).   4: To establish whether modification of maternal parenting (highlighted in 1-3), changes child mental health.  HOW: systematic review of parenting intervention trials and new synthesis methods to extract which intervention components reduce child mental health problems.  My study will provide critical new evidence regarding the nature of parenting interventions that have potential to improve child mental health and break intergenerational transmission of mental health problems.",0,0

In order to do this it will examine: 1) what is women's current place in decision making and the reasons for sex inequality in political representation; 2) the impact of the informal political sphere (NGOs etc) on the decisions of elected representatives as well as women's role in this type of activity; 3) the effects of shifts in the forms of government (weight of inter-communal bodies, interaction between local and EU level) and the way in which these influence gender relations.",1,0
580,51906,No,Investigation on thyroid cancer and other thyroid disorders in NIS countries affected by the post-Chernobyl nuclear accident,"Foreseen Results  The present proposal provides the basis for increasing our understanding of the situation and reinforcing ongoing collaborative research programs between the EU and the NIS countries. A strong relationship will be instituted among the three CIS countries in a way that the epidemiological results in one country may serve as control of an other country. The Chernobyl reactor accident was unprecedented in scale and in size of the population exposed. Belarus is the most affected country, with nearly 400 cases of thyroid cancer in children and nearly 100 cases in adolescents. Nearly 250 cases have been reported in Ukraine, while a lower, but still significant increase has been reported in the Russian Federation. Preliminary study carried out provided important achievement in understanding the clinical and biological features of radiation-induced thyroid cancer, but further researches are needed to answer several open questions. The aim of the proposal is to develop basic and clinical experimental design to reach the following objectives: evaluation of the biological and clinical behavior of radiation-induced thyroid carcinoma as compared with non-radiation-induced thyroid carcinoma. This will allow to assess the response to surgical and medical treatment and, on the basis of the results, to define more appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. In particular, the following aspects will be studied : the incidence of post-surgical complications; the assessment of disease-free interval after primary surgery and radioiodine therapy; the hormonal, metabolic and immune status of thyroid cancer patients according to type of operation and hormonal treatment, including treatment for post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Study of autoimmune diseases in children exposed to post-Chernobyl fall out. Beside thyroid cancer, it is important to assess whether other radiation-induced thyroid disorders, including thyroid autoimmunity has taken place as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident. Assessment of the effectiveness of l-thyroxine suppressive therapy in childhood thyroid cancer. L-thyroxine (L-T4) is an essential part in the treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. However, L-T4 suppressive therapy in children with thyroid cancer may be a difficult task, because the threshold for feedback regulation of TSH by thyroid hormones is higher in children than in adults. In view of the above consideration, the aim of the research programme is to establish the optimal TSH-suppressive doses of L-T4 to be administered in children and monitor L-T4 treatment in order to avoid drug overdose of incomplete suppression of TSH. Assessment of iodine deficiency and the need for iodine supplementation in the prevention of radiation-induced thyroid disorders. Dietary iodine deficiency is the major cause of goitre and may result in a number of other disorders, inclosing hypothyroidism. Evidence to date strongly suggests that the secondary rise in TSH in iodine deficiency may play a role in thyroid carcinogenesis. Implementation of molecular studies. Investigation of oncogenies and other molecular alterations is another major objective of the proposal, which will be carried out in frozen tissues or in paraffin embedded archival material. Cell cultures from post-Chernobyl thyroid carcinomas will also be established in order to perform cellular and molecular investigation in vitro.",0,0
812,100554,No,Linking Pathogen Evolution and Epidemiology,"The goal of the proposed research is a comprehensive understanding of how evolutionary potential of pathogen populations interacts with epidemiological dynamics in natural populations. The empirical work will be conducted on the specialist fungal pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis and its host plant Plantago lanceolata in a large network of host populations. I will address the key theories of pathogen evolution, involving life-history trade-offs, competition for resources under multiple infection, and sexual reproduction. This project takes advantage of the exceptional research opportunities offered by the focal study species to test models that have not been validated with respect to realized population dynamics and the persistence of pathogen populations. I have studied the coevolutionary dynamics between P. plantaginis and P. lanceolata for several years. Unique epidemiological data have been collected annually on the occurrence of the pathogen in a network of 4000 host populations since 2001. Recently, I have generated an EST library for the pathogen that allows and facilitates genetic studies. In the planned research, I will combine laboratory experiments with large-scale population surveys, genetic studies and mathematical modelling to achieve the objectives of this proposal. The proposed research has potential for groundbreaking results on pathogen evolution and epidemiology through: i) Simultaneous study of multiple forces driving pathogen evolution and their importance in natural populations, with direct connections to epidemiology. ii) Development of new methodology for the study of obligate parasites like P. plantaginis. iii) Construction of a stochastic, spatially explicit epidemiological model predicting pathogen occurrence from one season to the next with applicability to a wide range of pathogens. iv) Identifying critical life-history stages and mechanisms for virulence evolution yield much needed insights and tools into the battle against disease.",0,0
272,13409,No,MUTATION STUDIES UPON SPERMATOGONIAL STEM CELLS OF MAMMALS AND GENETIC TESTS FOR NON-DISJUNCTION IN THE MOUSE,"This project is a continuation of Contract Number B16*0173 (Dr C Tease), Karyotypic analysis of spontaneous and radiation-induced chromosome anomalies in mouse foetuses, which has been combined with BI6*0143.   The aim of the present work is to examine further the various factors that influence the response of mouse oocytes to radiation-induced genetic damage. Such information should prove of value when using data from female mice for human genetic risk estimations.  Studies upon strain differences in genetic response to radiation may facilitate extrapolation of mouse data to man. The 101/H strain gives a different response from other mice tested. The basis of this difference is being studied.  The results of a 3 \ 3 Gy study have shown that 101/H males had far longer sterile periods than the standard hydrid indicating higher levels of stem cell killing, but the specific locus mutation response was not significantly different.  Whether the stem cells remaining in the testis 24h after population depletion by X-rays or chemical agents are uniformly sensitive to genetic damage and cell killing and wherther the stem cells present in the testis 4 or more days after population depletion are in the process of repopulating the germinal epithelium are both questions that have been answered by giving hydroxyured (HU) pretreatments (500 \ 500 mg/kg, 3h interval) 3h prior to 6 Gy X-irradiation. Population depletion was brought about by TEM treatment (2 mg/kg). Translocations were the genetic end pooint, and cell killing was assessed by reduction in recovered testis weight. Comparison of treatment groups show that the HU pretreatments enhanced cell killing 24h after population depletion suggesting that not all cells were in a sensitive non-dividing state but that some cells were in the S phase and therefore subject to killing by HU. However, no associated increase in the translocation yield was observed. The TEM \ X-ray 24h treatment gave a much higher yield than obtained in prrevious studies. Therefore, an heterogeneity may, overall by indicated. Comparison of groups also show that the HU enhanced the level of cell killing 4 days after population depletion, again indicating that a substantial proportion of cells must be undergoing division. In this instance an enhanced translocation yield was obtained consistent with enrichment of G1 phase cells that are sensitive to translocation-induction by X-rays.  Research has been carried out into the development of 2 systems of genetic (complementation) tests using Robertsonian (Rb) translocations in tester animals to detect nondisjunction and chromosome loss events in normal mice. The 2 methods are being evaluated for detecting chromosome 11 loss, with 1 method being used to compare the frequency of chromosomes 11 and 13 loss following X-irradiation of males and females.  The Rb tester method, used to detect chromosome 11 and 13 loss following X-irradiation o chromosomally normal males or females, employed the Rb(11.13)4Bnr translocation carried heterozygeously in the tester animals. The chromosome 11 and 13 markers were estigial tail (vt) and satin (sa), respectively. Following irradiation with 4 Gy X-rays the normal wild type animals were mated for 1 week to the tester mice and the progeny screened for the vt and sa young, these indicated chromosome 11 and 13 loss events. The same mating regime and X-ray dose was used with monobrachial homology (MBH) tester method but here the tester animals carried both the Rb(11.13)4Bnr and RB(10.11)8Bnr translocations heterozygously. Chromosome 11 loss again was detected using vt as the marker.  Chromosome 11 loss was detected in all 4 types of cros but the frequencies were generally lower than found with several other chromosomes previously tested. In females at least, the MBH tester system appears to be more effective than the Rb tester system for detecting chromosome 11 loss. Difficulties were encountered in breeding from Rb tester females, necessitating reestablishment of the stock on a more vigorous background. This has now been achieved and the experimental work is in progress.  An understanding of factors that influence the response of mouse oocytes to radiation induced genetic damage may assist human risk assessment. It is not known whether a strain dependent variability occurs with female germ cells, as found in males. A study has therefore been initiated to compare the incidence of structural chromosome anomalies following X-irradiation of oocytes in 2 inbred strains. Female mice of the inbred strains C3H/HeH and 101/H were given either 2 or 4 Gy of acute X-rays. 14 days after treatment the females were induced to ovulate and metaphase I stage cells collected for assessment of induced chromosome damage. Age matched unirradiated females were used as controls. The slides prepared from control and irradiated females were coded and randomized prior to analysis. As analysis is not yet complete, the experiment has not been decoded.  Female mice of the F1 hybrid type C3H/HeH x 101/H were induced to ovulate and 3 h after human chorionic gonadtrophin (HCG), when the oocyts were at diakinesis of meiosis, they were given 1 Gy of acute X-rays. The females were mated overnight to males of the genotype Rb(8.19)1Ct ru/ Rb(9.19) ru and their offspring screened for the ru phenotype which occurs when maternal loss of chromosome 19 is complemented by paternal gain. The data clearly demonstrate the ability of X-rays to induce chromosome 19 loss in immediately preovulatory oocytes. The rate of chromosome loss is greater than that found in earlier experiments where dictyate stage oocytes were given 4 Gy of X-rays. This trend is consistent with the expectations of cytogenetic analyses which have shown that immediately preovulatoryoocytes are considerably more sensitive to radiation induced structural chromosome anomalies than cells at earlier stages of germ cell development. Firstly, the influence of mouse strain on oocyte radiosensitivity is being investigated. Two inbred strains, C3H/HeH and 101/H, are being used initially; information from F1 hybrid females between these strains is already available for comparison. The animals are being given either 2 or 4 Gy of X-rays and the effect of the treatment is being assessed by analysis of metaphase I stage oocytes for chromosome aberrations.   Secondly, induced loss of chromosome 19 is being examined using a genetic complementation test. Female mice are being given 1 Gy of X-rays a few hours prior to ovulation; germ cells are known to be extremely radiosensitive at this point of development. The induced incidence of chromosome 19 loss can be estimated from the frequency of genetically marked offspring resulting from complementation. This information will be useful for :  assessing the importance of chromosome size as a factor influencing induced genetic damage;  comparing the radiosensitivities of oocyte at different stages of follicle development;  determining the relative sensitivities of different assays to detect radiation-induced genetic damage in oocytes.",0,0
332,193278,No,Models of Child Health Appraised,"Children’s health affects the future of Europe – children are citizens, future workers, parents and carers. Children are dependent on society to provide effective health services (UN Convention on the Rights of the Child). Models of child primary health care vary widely across Europe based on two broad alternatives (primary care paediatricians or generic family doctors), and a variety of models of school health and adolescent direct access services. There is little research to show which model(s) are best, implying that some are inefficient or ineffective, with sub-optimal outcomes. MOCHA will draw on networks, earlier child health projects and local agents to model and evaluate child primary care in all 30 EU/EEA countries.  Scientific partners from 11 European countries, plus partners from Australia and USA, encompassing medicine, nursing, economics, informatics, sociology and policy management, will: • Categorise the models, and school health and adolescent services • Develop innovative measures of quality, outcome, cost, and workforce of each, and apply them using policy documents, routine statistics, and available electronic data sets • Assess effects on equality, and on continuity of care with secondary care. • Systematically obtain stakeholder views. • Indicate optimal future patterns of electronic records and big data to optimise operation of the model(s).  The results will demonstrate the optimal model(s) of children’s primary care with a prevention and wellness focus, with an analysis of factors (including cultural) which might facilitate adoption, and indications for policy makers of both the health and economic gains possible. The project will have a strong dissemination programme throughout to ensure dialogue with public, professionals, policy makers, and politicians.  The project will take 42 months (36 of scientific work plus start up and close), and deliver major awareness and potential benefit for European children’s health and healthy society.",0,0
569,96297,No,Sex in the Early Modern City: Musical Eroticism in Rome,"This project examines the role of music in Rome in creating, circulating, reinforcing, policing and subverting norms of gender and sexuality. The methods by which sexuality and the erotic are transmitted by music (of any age) are not wholly understood; through this investigation we learn more about the affective nature of music, and how music can be used as a political and cultural tool. The research identifies eroticism in music in secular song, drawing on madrigals as well as a repertory of strophic song that is marginal within the discipline of musicology, and then, with reference to settings of the Song of Songs and to the liturgy of women saints, explores eroticism in sacred music. A key aspect is the examination of how early modern women and men interacted with music and fashioned diverse identities that were distinguished by class, ethnicity, race, region, religion, gender, and sexuality. The project argues that some aspects of the European project originate in early modern history. The project promotes awareness and understanding of diversity in the history of gender and sexualities and responds to European legislation against discrimination. It is vital to make clear the long history of sexual diversity in Europe, and the long history of music’s role in sexualities, as a means to work against discrimination on grounds of sexuality and to support and encourage a healthy attitude to diversity. This project will be carried out in Los Angeles, New York and Cork. The initial stage of data collection and analysis will take 12 months, with the remaining 24 months spent writing and developing a monograph, hosting an international, interdisciplinary conference in Europe and developing advance research training networks.",1,0

The issue of underrepresented groups participating fully in astrophysics has been a long-standing concern of astrophysicists worldwide. Astrophysicists recognize the importance of mobility in building a scientific career, but social science research revealed that women astrophysicists have to move more often & stay abroad longer to achieve the same career rank as men (analysis has not been done for astrophysicists embodying other forms of underrepresentation). ASTROMOVES examines the careers of astrophysicists (men, women & the gender diverse), their career decision-making and the role of mobility. 50 astrophysicists (European or worked in Europe) more than 8 years past their doctorate (>two career relocations), will be interviewed using semi-structured interviews focused on each of their career moves & their underlying decision-making process. Of interest is if their decision-making includes perceptions of scientific reputation, discrimination/bullying, family friendliness & career enhancement and how each astrophysicist ranks these. Training includes learning the latest qualitative analysis software for analysing the interviews and the latest visualization techniques for showing career moves consecutively. The research results will inform policies to support & enhance the careers of underrepresented astrophysicists with broader implications for STEM in Europe. Project deliverables include peer-reviewed articles, scholarly presentations, public lectures & a documentary film. The project will be based in the STIS department at UEDIN, proximate to the UK Royal Observatory. My career goal is to obtain a position in an interdisciplinary department similar to STIS.",0,0

481,101182,No,Sex-specific genetic effects on fitness and human disease,"Darwin’s theory of natural selection rests on the principle that fitness variation in natural populations has a heritable component, on which selection acts, thereby leading to evolutionary change. A fundamental and so far unresolved question for the field of evolutionary biology is to identify the genetic loci responsible for this fitness variation, thereby coming closer to an understanding of how variation is maintained in the face of continual selection. One important complicating factor in the search for fitness related genes however is the existence of separate sexes – theoretical expectations and empirical data both suggest that sexually antagonistic genes are common. The phrase “two sexes, one genome” nicely sums up the problem; selection may favour alleles in one sex, even if they have detrimental effects on the fitness of the opposite sex, since it is their net effect across both sexes that determine the likelihood that alleles persist in a population. This theoretical framework raises an interesting, and so far entirely unexplored issue: that in one sex the functional performance of some alleles is predicted to be compromised and this effect may account for some common human diseases and conditions which show genotype-sex interactions. I propose to explore the genetic basis of sex-specific fitness in a model organism in both laboratory and natural conditions and to test whether those genes identified as having sexually antagonistic effects can help explain the incidence of human diseases that display sexual dimorphism in prevalence, age of onset or severity. This multidisciplinary project directly addresses some fundamental unresolved questions in evolutionary biology: the genetic basis and maintenance of fitness variation; the evolution of sexual dimorphism; and aims to provide novel insights into the genetic basis of some common human diseases.",0,0
515,208604,No,The Role of the Ethnic Majority in Integration Processes: Attitudes and Practices towards Immigrants in Catalan Institutions,"This project proposal aims to take research on diversity management and integration further by focusing on how ethnic diversity is represented in three central Catalan institutions: the public school system, the Catalan police force and the City council of Barcelona. The case of Catalonia appears particularly relevant for an empirical study on the actual representation of diversity given its pronounced intercultural policy focus, while socio-economic inequality between natives and immigrants is vast, and many immigrants live in situations of precariousness and marginalization.   The proposal addresses key priorities set by the H2020/Europe in a changing world-Inclusive, innovative and reflective societies program, and contributes to European excellence in the social sciences by proposing a research program designed to i) increase knowledge on diversity management and obstacles for the participation/representation of immigrants in societal institutions, and ii) develop an action strategy to address shortcomings in this area, based on the view that research on social challenges as inequality and discrimination to a greater extent should contribute to combat these problems through practical implementation. The proposal is based upon the assumption that there is broad awareness of the problems with misrepresentation and discrimination of immigrants within Catalan institutions, but that these problems are merely addressed at the discursive level; what is lacking are measures to accomplish better practices.  At the theoretical level, the concept of interculturalism will be critically examined and de facto representation will be introduced as a central, complementary concept. The knowledge and action strategies generated through this project will be transferrable and useful in other contexts, also at the European level.",0,0

MAGEEQ will provide a conceptual framework to understand and manage the dimensions of gender equality policy frames. A comparative analysis will show shifting patterns in similarities & differences between Member & Candidate States, disconnections between national & EU frames, and patterns of exclusion that result from dominate frames.

915,98190,No,"Functional characterization of Shoot Growth 1, a novel QTL-based epiallele","Natural variation is widely used as a source of biodiversity to identify alleles controlling various traits. In the Institut Jean Pierre Bourgin (IJPB, INRA, Versailles) several groups are interested in the analysis of Arabidopsis natural variation. Classical approaches involving sets of Recombinant Inbred Lines (RIL) were developed and the genes explaining the QTLs were identified by map-based cloning and/or candidate gene approach. Interestingly, these very classical approaches led to the discovery of natural epialleles such as epiQTLs. The objective of the present project is to use my experience in the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying naturally varying traits to study one of the very first examples of epiQTL allele isolated from crosses between natural populations of Arabidopsis. This project builds upon the work of Dr. Daniela Vlad, a former PhD student in Dr. Olivier Loudet’s lab, who identified a novel natural epiallele named SG1. The proposed project will focus on a further characterisation of this particular epiallele and of the underlying gene function. The specific aims of this project will be to: • Understand how variation at SG1 results in a dramatic effect on fitness; • Characterize the epigenetic status of the SG1 locus and its impact on the genome to gain a better understanding of the interplay between different epigenetic mechanisms leading to the regulation of plant growth. The results from this study are likely to provide important insights into the regulation of gene expression controlled by DNA methylation, and we expect they will also improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which plants integrate internal cues to adjust growth.",0,0
754,44921,No,Cellular proliferation and apoptosis in the parathyroid glands - effects of phosphate in vivo and in vitro,"Research objectives and content  Most patients with chronic renal failure develop secondary  hyperparathyroidism, characterized by increases of parathyroid gland size and serum parathyroid hormone levels. Since secondary hyperparathyroidism is frequently associated with serious complications like renal osteodystrophies, atherosclerosis, soft tissue calcification, anemia, myocardiocytic fibrosis, etc., it's essential to prevent it. Furthermore, secondary hyperparathyroidism can be present even after renal transplantation, with frequent development of persistent  hyperparathyroidism, characterized by refractoriness to the usual therapies. Hyperphosphatemia is a very common finding in chronic renal failure. We have studied the role of hyperphosphatemia in the impairment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and have demonstrated direct effects of phosphorus increasing parathyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, and inducing a hyperplastic pattern in the parathyroid gland with an evident increase in the gland volume. Since the mechanisms leading to parathyroid gland hyperplasia are poorly defined, it's extremely relevant to study in depth the molecular and cellular mechanisms of parathyroid cell proliferation and programmed cell death. This project includes: i) the study of the effects of phosphate on molecular markers of parathyroid cell hyperplasia, to provide additional knowledgment about the genesis of this pathology, ii) the investigation of a possible phosphate-induced monoclonal pattern of proliferation, by which refractoriness to therapy can be explained, and iii) the assessment of the role of phosphate and calcitriol on programmed cell death (apoptosis), which could contribute to develop new treatments of hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  This project is an extension of my Ph.D. project, that will make possible studies which cannot be achieved at the University of La Laguna due to it s limitations. For this project, my previous experience with the phosphate-induced hyperparathyroidism rat model will be useful to carry out the experiments in vivo, and my training with the human parathyroid cell culture protocol developed by Dr. Drueke's group will be essential for the studies in vitro. The accumulative experience in the study of processes such as cell proliferation and programmed cell death will be important contributions upon my return to my present laboratory.",0,0
759,218934,No,The MarginGuide: a medical device to improve the results of cancer surgery,"SurGuide is a medical device company which aims to improve the results of oral cancer surgery. In the operating room, the surgeon has to rely on his hands and eyes to distinguish tumour from healthy tissue. This is very difficult. In only 15% of the cases, the tumour is removed with an adequate margin. When after surgery, during histopathological assessment, an inadequate margin is detected, the patient will receive adjuvant treatment (i.e. radiotherapy, additional surgery). This often causes lasting additional morbidity, with a negative effect on the quality of life. A fast and reliable methodology is needed to assess tumour removal with adequate margin, during surgery. The MarginGuide is being developed to meet this clinical need. It is a novel tool based on Raman spectroscopy; an optical technology. The MarginGuide consists of a Raman spectroscopic work station, a user-interface, and a fiber-optic probe employing disposable fiber-optic needles. It will be used to rapidly inspect the resection surfaces of the tissue that has been removed by the surgeon and will pinpoint locations where additional tissue should be removed to obtain an adequate margin. A proof-of-concept instrument is currently being tested. SurGuide expects to raise the success rate of oral cancer surgery from the current 15% to over 50%. No other device is able to measure the surgical margin in oral cancer surgery, which gives SurGuide a unique market position and the possibility to gain a dominant market share. Although, this is an ideal starting point, some market barriers still exist. In this project, SurGuide carries out a feasibility assessment covering a business feasibility study and partly a technological feasibility study. The objective of the feasibility assessment is to refine the business plan and the implementation plan for successful commercialization and to optimize the optical technology for the MarginGuide.",0,0

It focuses on the first three decades of development of photomechanical technologies, i.e. the era between the introduction of photography in the late 1830s and the outset of industrial mass-production of photography-based images in the 1860s. It centres on the UK, France and the Austrian Empire, as countries which played leading parts in the photomechanical research and practice from the 1840s onwards. Considering the state of the art of existing scholarship, as well as the amount and variety of preserved sources, the research will comprise collection and archival surveys, visual, material and contextual analysis and interpretation of original objects (prints and matrices), as well as close reading of correspondence, manuscripts and period publications. In order to understand the circumstances and cultural contexts in which different photomechanical technologies emerged and developed, the project will also look at social structures and networks of inventors, supporters, critics, and users. Great attention will be paid to theoretical period discussions on potential and the future of photomechanical printing. More elaborate knowledge of these phenomena will help to understand not only history of photography, but also history of art and science, and to consider more carefully different perspectives on development of photography-based technology and its interpretation. Through close collaboration with the supervisor and the partner institutions, the fellow will be able to extend her research beyond history of photography, and to enhance her complex research capacities, inter-sectoral collaboration, networking, leadership, managerial and publication skills. Advanced training through research, dissemination and communication activities will contribute significantly to the fellow’s professional and career development.",0,0
923,201316,No,"Peers in ECEC centres: who are they and do they matter? An empirical analysis on ECEC group composition, its drivers and its effects","Early childhood education and care (ECEC) services are increasingly seen as holding the promise of promoting more equal life chances for children by supporting their development and encouraging parental employment. Research shows that ECEC can fulfil such potential, as long as provision is of high quality and reaches the most disadvantaged children. Yet there is ample evidence that disadvantaged children are less likely to attend ECEC institutions. When they do, they are enrolled into settings with lower quality and/or settings catering mostly to other children from disadvantaged families. This latter aspect, relating to settings’ composition, is rarely investigated, but the few existing studies suggest that disadvantaged children “do better in settings with a mixture of children from different social backgrounds”. This research project seeks to offer new evidence on the composition of ECEC settings, to explore the drivers of different levels of concentration of disadvantaged children, and to measure the impact of such levels of concentration on child development. The composition of ECEC settings will be measured in relation to migration status, a salient dimension of educational disadvantage in several European countries. The project focuses on the specific case of Germany, where ECEC attendance varies markedly in relation to both socio-economic status and place of residence. The analysis will draw on different data sources, combining survey data on children and the ECEC they attend with information at a highly disaggregate regional level in order to account for the neighbourhood context in which families live. By combining three levels of analysis – families, ECEC settings, and neighbourhoods – the study develops an multilayered approach which will enrich the child development literature on ECEC services as well as our understanding of educational disadvantage. The findings will strengthen evidence-based knowledge in policy making and service provision in Europe.",0,0
978,79189,No,Marie Curie training Conferences and Workshops on Clostridia,"The economic impact of Clostridium pathogens on European human and veterinary health is escalating. Mortality due to C. difficile is increasing due to the emergence of a highly virulent clone, the withdrawal of antibiotic growth promoters in feed stuffs ha s led to a dramatic increase in necrotic enteritis in fowl due to C. perfringens and there are heightened public concerns over the use of C. botulinum by bioterrorists. Novel strategies are needed to counter these threats. However, the European clostridial community is fragmented, and lacks the necessary critical mass. Moreover, the perceived difficulty of working with anaerobes has deterred young scientists from entering the field. To be internationally competitive, it is crucial that an enlarged European network of clostridial researchers is formed. This will be brought about through a series of educational conferences and workshops aimed at young researchers. Our objective is to educate and inform young European scientists on the biology of the clostridia and the diseases they cause. This will: 1) elevate European clostridial research to the international forefront, and establish long-term research synergies within the EU to increase mobility and improve the career prospects of young researchers; 2) ensure re-location of the International ClostPath symposia to Europe in order to gain a competitive advantage over the US; 3) encourage young researchers to combine the knowledge from genetics and genomics with human and veterinary clinical aspects, and; 4) educ ate young researchers in presentational, teaching and practical skills. By training young researchers in topics strongly developed in Europe (genomics, toxinology, diagnostics) and by presenting the main achievements developed elsewhere (pathogenesis, new epidemiological methods, countermeasures) we aim to create a new generation of clostridial researchers that will ensure that Europe is able to out-compete the USA and Japan.",0,0

This also presents major health, social and economic challenges to wider society. Our International Network unites leaders from academia, policy, practice, business and community organisations from the EU and US. Each partner has an impressive track record of leading evidence-based policy and programme development at a national level and each has pioneered participation in research of people with lived experience of mental health problems. This transatlantic network will share and build upon state of the art knowledge in four key areas of social inclusion: citizenship, recovery, stigma and public policy.  Our collaboration will enable new knowledge, synergies and solutions to emerge by connecting our diverse national and disciplinary perspectives with the lived experiences of people with mental health problems. Through the network we will enhance the skills and career opportunities for researchers and practitioners, and contribute towards the sustained inclusion of people with lived experience. This grant will enable us to share our learning in profound ways to understand ‘what works’ in very different social contexts, including through interaction between the four themed work packages. There is a strong commitment amongst partners to maintain the network long term. As partners we have considerable experience in supporting participatory mental health research with migrant citizens, people who are homeless and diverse ethnic minorities. Social exclusion is often intensified for women who encounter gender-based discrimination and cumulative adversity. Therefore, throughout this proposal, we will pay particular attention to issues of intersectionality in relation to gender, and consider how promoting social inclusion, citizenship and rights must take account of social identities.",0,0
774,95781,No,Identification of Clinically Useful Biomarkers for IGF-I Receptor Signalling n Cancer,"The Insulin-like Growth Factor I Receptor (IGF-IR) is widely expressed on human tissues and has been shown to promote the growth and invasiveness of cancer cells. It is a potentially important therapeutic target for several major cancers including breast, lung and colon, and has attracted major interest from pharmaceutical companies and clinicians. Currently, at least 70 clinical trials are underway to test several different IGF-IR kinase inhibitors and blocking antibodies. However, unlike some other growth factor receptors the IGF-IR is not amplified or over-expressed in cancer. One of the major challenges to targeting the IGF-IR in cancer is the lack of suitable biomarkers that will a) assess IGF-IR activity in tumours, b) facilitate selection of patients and subsets of tumours that are most likely to respond to inhibitors, and c) monitor responses to IGF-IR inhibition. This programme aims to address this problem by identifying and validating biomarkers for the IGF-IR signalling pathway in cancer. This programme involves a collaboration between researchers at University College Cork who are experts in IGF-I signalling and researchers at Almac Diagnostics who are experts in pharmacogenomic approaches to biomarker discovery in cancer. The research plan will take two complementary approaches: 1) explore the potential of a list of candidate genes that have already been identified in a screen for IGF-IR activity in cancer; and 2) carry out an unbiased genomic screen using a combination of cell models selected as models for IGF-I signalling and proprietary databases that have been collated from different sources, including patient data. The research programme is highly collaborative and includes extensive transfer of knowledge and experience, and exchanges of researchers between the University and Almac.

977,89077,No,Developing Europe's Rural Regions in the Era of Globalization: An Interpretative Model for Better Anticipating and Responding to Challenges for Regional Development in an Evolving International Context,"Globalization is one of the key challenges facing rural regions in Europe, bringing significant social, economic, cultural and political changes. Current studies on the impact of globalization on rural regions tend to focus on specific sectors or processes or localities. The absence of an overarching integrative analysis has resulted in the inability of regional development strategies to cope with these challenges. The objective of the DERREG project is to produce an interpretative model that will enable regional development actors to better anticipate and respond to the key challenges for disadvantaged regions arising from globalization. In doing so, it will expand scientific knowledge and understanding, inform policy development, and identify examples of best practice. The project is innovative in adopting an integrative approach that synthesises research across four key themes and nine case study regions in different types of rural regions to produce an overarching analysis of the impact of globalization on rural Europe. The research will involve both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. It will develop new methods in areas such as business network analysis. A further innovation is the linking of the scientific analysis with practical application through the development of an interpretative model. The consortium comprises 9 partners with expertise in rural and regional research, focusing on Eastern Europe. The consortium has been assembled to provide an appropriate combination of expertise in the areas examined in the project, including rural businesses, migration, sustainable development, capacity-building and gender.  The proposed research will enable policy makers and other stakeholders involved in regional development to better anticipate and respond to the challenges of globalization. It will support initiatives to increase the capacity of rural businesses to engage with new opportunities and to enhance social cohesion.",0,0

Group care is evidence-based, transforms the delivery of maternal, newborn and child health care and reduces inequities in services utilization, improves the quality of services, and makes a significant positive impact on the health and wellbeing of mothers, families and children. No evidence-based guidelines exist for health systems to establish and sustain this transformative model.  Care in a group changes the user(s)-provider experience, encourages self-care, is empowering and enables end-users to learn to increase healthy behaviours for themselves and for their children. It breaks the vicious circle of poor quality and inadequate utilization of services by offering comprehensive antenatal and postnatal care that meets the needs of the end users, care providers and health systems by combining quality clinical care with health promotion and health information activities.  GC_1000, demonstration sites in 4 low- and middle-income countries, as well as in 3 high-income countries in settings that serve the most vulnerable women and girls, will deliver group antenatal and postnatal care throughout the project.

Implement group antenatal and postnatal care in selected demonstration sites in collaborative ways that set the groundwork for sustained service delivery and possibilities for scaling- up;   2.            Analyze within country data that emerge from the implementation process to create country-specific blueprints for scale-up; 3.            Use cross-country synthesis to develop a global implementation strategy toolbox for the adaptation, implementation and scale up of facilitated group care within the first 1000 days, particularly to reach the most vulnerable groups of women and girls globally.",0,0
236,207213,No,Healthy minds from 0-100 years: Optimising the use of European brain imaging cohorts,"Our main objective is to identify determinants of brain, cognitive and mental health at different stages of life. By integration, harmonisation and enrichment of major European neuroimaging studies of age differences and changes, we will obtain an unparalleled database of fine-grained brain, cognitive and mental health measures of more than 6.000 individuals. Longitudinal brain imaging, genetic and health data are available for a major part, as well as cognitive/mental health measures for extensively broader cohorts, exceeding 40.000 examinations in total. By linking these data, also to additional databases and biobanks, including birth registries, national and regional archives, and by enriching them with new online data collection and novel measures, we will address risk and protective factors of brain, cognitive and mental health throughout the lifespan. We will identify the pathways through which risk and protective factors work and their moderators. Through exploitation of, and synergies with, existing European infrastructures and initiatives, this approach of integrating, harmonising and enriching brain imaging datasets will make major conceptual, methodological and analytical contributions towards large integrative cohorts and their efficient exploitation. We will thus provide novel information on brain, cognitive and mental health maintenance, onset and course of brain, cognitive and mental disorders, and lay a foundation for earlier diagnosis of brain disorders, aberrant development and decline of brain, cognitive and mental health, as well as future preventive and therapeutic strategies. Working with stakeholders and health authorities, the project will provide the evidence base for policy strategies for prevention and intervention, improving clinical practice and public health policy for brain, cognitive and mental health. This project is realized by a close collaboration of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) and major European brain research centres",0,0
22,196793,Yes,Agents of Change: Women Editors and Socio-Cultural Transformation in Europe (1710-1920),"This project examines a neglected aspect of the social and cultural life in Europe in the modern period: the impact of women editors on public debate. From the 1700s on, European women actively participated in the cultural arena through the journals that they edited. This project advances the hypothesis that periodical editorship enabled these women to take a prominent role in public life, to influence public opinion and to shape transnational processes of change. In order to test this hypothesis, the project will bring together a multilingual and multidisciplinary team of six researchers who will combine methodologies from literary studies, (women’s) history and the social sciences to map the transnational networks of intellectual exchange in which women editors participated, with particular attention to practices of textual transfer (including translation, adaptation, reprinting and reviewing) across language boundaries and historical periods. The project has two parts: 1) a database will take stock of women editors and their periodicals, make available new material and provide a data source for socio-textual network analysis; 2) five thematic subprojects will study the impact of women editors on some of the most significant processes of socio-cultural transformation in modern European history: the beginnings of the periodical press, the rise of the novel, domestic ideology, consumer culture and women’s rights. By examining how these processes unfolded in the press through practices of textual transfer both among women and in the larger publishing landscape, the project will not only initiate a shift in our thinking about the participation of women in society and print culture but also pave the way for pan-European research on the periodical press.",1,1
817,196586,No,Contentious Rights: A Comparative Study of International Human Rights Norms and their Effects on Domestic Social Conflict,"Contentious Rights: A Comparative Study of International Human Rights Norms and their Effects on Domestic Social Conflict   Over the last 60 years, a broad set of international norms gained importance as instruments to regulate a globalising world. Enshrined in human rights conventions, these norms contribute to strengthen a platform for social mobilization and voice. The introduction of human rights standards at the domestic level, however, has also been responsible for the generation of new tensions on the interpretation and application of these norms. Yet, this type of conflict and polarization among social and political actors remain widely unexplored. This project will examine how ‘human rights act in practice’ in the post-ratification phase using a multidisciplinary perspective and an empirical comparative approach. More precisely, it addresses the task of identifying the conditions under which international norms generate consensus and cooperation or fragmentation and conflict between domestic social and political actors and the consequences in terms of human rights practices. The candidate fellow Dr. Lorenza Fontana will focus on a comparative analysis of two conventions (International Labor Organization’s Conventions 182 on Child Labor and 189 on Domestic Workers) in two countries (Bolivia and Philippines) and lead an interdisciplinary collaboration between Prof. Jean Grugel (University of Sheffield, SIID), and Prof. Beth Simmons (Harvard University, WCFIA). This project will greatly increase our understanding of the effects of human rights norms on domestic societies and provide policy relevant results.",1,0
275,197487,No,MicroRNA determinants of the balance between effector and regulatory T cells in vivo,"T lymphocytes display potent pro- or anti-inflammatory properties, which typically associate with distinct effector (Teff) versus regulatory (Treg) cell subsets. Based on published and our preliminary data showing a major impact of microRNAs on T cell differentiation and (auto)immune pathology,  my proposal aims to dissect the miRNA networks that control the balance between Teff and Treg subsets in vivo, in various experimental models of infection and autoimmunity.   We will focus on three critical  mediators of T cell functions: interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and interleukin-17A (IL-17), highly pro-inflammatory Teff cytokines; and Foxp3, the transcription factor that confers Treg  suppressive properties. To track the activity of these key genes, we will generate a new Ifng/ Il17/ Foxp3 triple reporter mouse, from which we will isolate Teff and Treg subsets to determine their genome-wide miRNA profiles and specific signatures in vivo. We will investigate both natural (thymic-derived and present in naïve mice) and induced (in the periphery upon challenge) Teff and Treg subsets, as they make distinct contributions to the immune response. We will identify miRNAs selectively expressed in Teff (Ifng\ or Il17\) versus Treg (Foxp3\) subsets of various lineages (CD4\, CD8\, gamma-delta or NKT) in each in vivo model; assess whether they are induced during thymic development or upon peripheral activation; and determine the robustness of subset-specific miRNA profiles across various in vivo challenges.   We will then use loss- and gain-of-function strategies to define the individual miRNAs that impact Teff or Treg differentiation and  disease pathogenesis; dissect the external cues and intracellular mechanisms that regulate miRNA expression; and identify the mRNA networks controlled by key miRNAs in Teff and Treg differentiation. I expect this project to provide major conceptual and experimental advances towards manipulating miRNAs either to boost immunity or to treat autoimmunity.",0,0
828,83541,No,Evolutionary Consequences of Demographic Perturbations in Plant Populations: A Theoretical Study,"The genetic consequences of landscape alterations are a central concern in plant conservation biology. Both the FP6 thematic priority Sustainable Development, Global Change and Ecosystems, and the EU 6th Community Environment Action Programme explicitly en courage action to investigate the interaction between genetic resources and human activities, including the development of modelling and forecasting tools.  In this spirit, this project aims at developing a predictive model of the evolution of neutral and adaptive genes in plant populations subject to demographic perturbation. We will combine population genetics theory with realistic plant demographic dynamics, trying to overcome the spatial and dispersal restrictions of previous studies.  To achieve so, we w ill formulate an individual-based model that accounts for non-uniform distribution of individuals in space and time, different dispersal distributions, and stochastic demography. The model will be parameterised using information from available field studies.  A coalescent algorithm, conditioned on the demographic history of the simulated populations, will be implemented to estimate the effective population parameters, evaluate their evolution under demographic perturbation, and contrast the results with those obtained from simple analytical approximations. Finally, the effects of accumulating mildly deleterious mutations in small plant populations under restricted dispersal and fluctuating density will be investigated.  Based on the results, we will formulate practical recommendations for conservation planning. From a training point of view, the project will add complementary mathematical and evolutionary dimensions to the applicant's current empirical background in molecular ecology.  He will have the chance to develop analytical skills through collaboration with a world-leading group in theoretical evolutionary biology, building a better-rounded multidisciplinary approach to his career.",0,0

The overall aim is to deliver targeted cross border services to highly innovative entrepreneurs, start-ups and SMEs in the ICT sector in order to accelerate their growth. The ACE programme is supported by cross border finance experts and European innovation support networks EBN and ENOLL.<br/>To test the ACE concept, a pilot programme will be implemented involving  highly innovative companies from each partner region. The emphasis will be  on achieving tangible outcomes for companies in terms of investment and new clients.  To achieve these outcomes, ACE will put in place operational schemes to connect companies with international networks of investors and to establish a network of potential clients (in both the public and private sector).   Central to the ACE programme will be the establishment of a collaborative platform supporting open innovation between participating companies and the ACE support network.<br/>ACE does not propose a 'one stop shop' approach to internationalisation.  Companies will be assigned an experienced mentor in their own country who will analyse their internationalisation strengths and weaknesses and in response put together a customised programme of support measures drawing on the facilities, services and  local expertise and knowledge of  partners in other countries.  Support measures may include for example; Living Lab validation in another country, hands on technical/ market assistance, preparing companies for pitches for cross border investment.<br/>Virtual international support teams for each company will be formed and a competitive element will be introduced with an award for the most successful companies at the end of the programme.",0,0
767,185372,No,Connectors – an international study into the development of children’s everyday practices of participation in circuits of social action,"Participation – defined in this project as the social practice of engaging in personal and social change – links private and public life, biography and history, and forms a mechanism for social action. Twenty years after the ratification of the United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child (1989) the international community is no closer to identifying what constitutes a ‘good enough’ model for understanding and supporting the development of children’s participation in public life. The project asks game changing questions about the emergence of children’s orientation towards social action through qualitative, longitudinal and cross-national research. Building on biographical interviews with children, relational and geographical mapping techniques, selective participant-observation with children, and children social research workshops in three cities (London, Athens, Mumbai), the project examines the meaning of personal and social change in middle childhood (6-11 year olds), the circuits of social action that children tap into in an attempt to make changes real, the extent to which privilege, marginalization and economic crisis shape children’s practices of participation, and the ways in which encounters with difference (gender, ethnicity, race, religion) challenge children’s orientation towards social action. By sampling children from a diverse cross-section of each city the project will collect and follow a total of 100 children over a five-year period. The project will provide a rich data sources for making within and between country comparisons and in doing so enable the development a theoretical paradigm for understanding children’s participation that is derived from the bottom-up, that is generated in diverse settings, including non-Western, and that takes advantage of the current rupture to established socio-economic realities to ask questions about the future of social action.",0,0

Although this kind of technology is the only one existing, it does not produce good quality patterns due to the human factor and also the low resolution patterns produced. The use of these techniques in wider area patterning for pseudo-3D-patterns is very expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, patterning in colour of glass, both on the surface and in the bulk material, involves chemical and/or thermochemical procedures that are expensive and produce simple patterns. Over the last years, lasers have found many industrial applications particularly in machining and material processing. Most of these applications concern the treatment of metals and alloys. Lasers offer the advantage and photon energy may be provided in a temporally and spatially controlled manner and in a contact-free and clean process. In this proposal, laser-based patterning techniques will be evaluated and the potential use of the most promising will be fully exploited, both technically and financially. Two different approaches will be investigated. The first one is the 'laser-based surface dry etching' of the glass surface that gives the possibility to produce pseudo-3D-patterns. The other one is the 'laser triggered colour change' of the glass either on the surface on in the bulk material. During this project, a demonstration pilot machine cell will be developed and tested in order to evaluate the technology developed under working conditions. This prototype will form the basis for future development and production o f machines that use laser for decorative purposes on various materials (glass, marble, wood, metal etc.)",0,0
177,216034,No,Emergent Ethics of Drone Violence: Toward a Comprehensive Governance Framework,"The increasing use of armed, uninhabited aircraft (drones) is a serious political challenge with implications for security and justice worldwide. Drone technology is attracting high levels of investment, drones controlled remotely are becoming more numerous, and technological momentum toward drones controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) is building. Many human lives are at stake in this, so the violent use of drones continues to raise ethical questions. DRONETHICS will systematically address an urgent need to clarify the morality of ‘drone violence’, defined as violence involving a weapon system that is radically remote from its immediate user. Such remoteness is achieved through extreme physical distancing or the devolution of agency from humans to machines, so drone violence disrupts traditional expectations about war and a warrior’s exposure to risk. In turn, the disruptively innovative premise of this project is that such violence does not necessarily fall within the remit of the Just War framework according to which war is traditionally judged and governed. Moving beyond state-of-the-art Just War thinking, the project opens up an ethical inquiry into drone violence conceptualised as either war, law enforcement, interpersonal violence, or devolved (to AI) violence. An interdisciplinary research team, incorporating international relations, moral philosophy and computer science perspectives, will conduct rigorous analysis of documentary sources and engage closely with officials, drone operators, and roboticists. Through innovative exploration and application of alternative frameworks for governing violence, DRONETHICS will produce: the first integrated conceptual framework for explaining ethical concerns arising from current and potential forms of drone violence; concrete recommendations for policy-makers on how to manage this violence ethically; and a new normative vision for shaping the longer-term trajectory of drone violence for the good of all humanity.",0,0
945,227073,No,A novel medical device for the treatment of Endometriosis,"Endometriosis is one of the most prevalent, impactful and undertreated disorders to affect European women. The condition is defined as an estrogen-dependent disorder, where endometrial tissue forms lesions outside the uterus resulting in chronic pain and infertility. Endometriosis affects an estimated 10% of European women in the reproductive-age group (176 million women worldwide and 10.7 million in the EU) with significant impact on their physical, mental, and social well-being (This impact is exacerbated by the fact that the correct diagnosis is made as late as 8–11 years after symptom presentation. Treatment delays are due to a lack of a reliable non-invasive diagnostic test, and the fact that the reference diagnostic standard is laparoscopy (invasive, expensive and not without risks). As there is no permanent cure for endometriosis, current therapies have three main goals: (i) to reduce pain; (ii) to increase the pregnancy rate for women who desire to have children and (iii) to delay recurrence for as long as possible. The EndoSolve project will develop the first medical device to treat the underlying mechanism of endometriosis, providing a long-term non-pharma treatment for the chronic disease.",0,0
53,197298,Yes,Gender Diversity Impact – Improving research and innovation through gender diversity,"The impact of gender diversity on research productivity, quality and innovation is very unevenly evidenced.  Incremental insights from gender studies,  team science and research evaluation exercises do not transcend these separate areas and are therefore of restricted analytical value. This can be seen, for example, in the understanding of 'gender' as simply concerned with the numerical representation of the two sexes in most quantitative analyses. This not only factors out the gendered hierarchies and social processes that condition science in general and work group dynamics in particular, but severely hampers systematic comparisons of research performance impacts. Using innovative methods for the analysis of the diversity-research productivity relationship, Gedii will develop a reliable diversity measure that is sensitive to power, status and information sharing differentials within teams and across public & private organisations. This Gender-Diversity-Index (GDI) will thus provide a much more nuanced and realistic measure of the impact of gender diversity on research productivity, quality and innovation across countries and sectors.  GDI scores will be explored in relation to a flexible set of performance indicators, including patent and bibliometric measures, combined with new indicators of social impact. Gedii's evaluation framework thus responds to the growing concern with responsible research and innovation. To address the social relevance and utility of our research, Gedii will engage stakeholders early and often: through advisory groups, virtual challenges, and theme-based innovation testimonials. By combining disparate conceptual approaches to gender diversity with an innovative assessment tool, Gedii will for the first time provide clear and comprehensive evidence for the link between gender diversity and research performance and enable research policy- and decision-makers to significantly enhance the capacity of European research.",1,1
677,227935,No,Sub beati Petri et nostra protectione suscipimus: Re-framing the relations between Rome and the kingdoms of Portugal and Aragon (eleventh-thirteenth centuries),"My research project will examine and compare the relations of the Papacy with Portugal and Aragon from the pontificate of Alexander II (1061-1073) to that of Innocent III (1198-1216). Portugal and Aragon have been chosen because were the only political realities in the Iberian Peninsula to enjoy the protection of St Peter in these centuries. These relationships have been interpreted as a feudal bond, but recent studies have started to challenge this image. This analysis will fit into and expand recent discussions of the relations between centre (Rome) and periphery, focusing on an ecclesiological perspective. To whom was the Apostolic See writing? And who was writing to Rome? Why? Did the letters concern practical or theoretical matters? What language and images were adopted by Rome to assert its primacy over Portugal and Aragon and what ecclesiological ideas? Was there ever a feudal bond between these political institutions and Rome? Or was the papacy only reacting to events, claiming a role that it could not play? Was there a particular style in use when writing to the pope? Did ecclesiastics and lay powers adopt similar or distinct formulas when writing to the Apostolic See? These are some of the questions the project aims to answer. Letters issued by the papal chancery are the main source for this kind of analysis because they always entailed the official view of the Roman church on a specific matter, showing the communication strategies and the ecclesiological ideas adopted by the Apostolic See to assert Roman primacy. Missives sent to the popes also played a decisive role in the creation of papal images. This project will shed light not only on the papacy and on the strategies adopted to support its claims of primacy, but also on views of the Roman church from a frontier of Christianity, which may (or may not) have been shared by the papacy itself.",0,0

Estimated costs are €43 billion/year for IBS, mostly derived from comorbid IBS. Our hypothesis is that comorbid IBS represents a distinct clinical entity, arising from distorted brain-gut communication with a unique, specific, but undefined pathophysiological origin, differing from IBS alone. DISCOvERIE was created to advance the understanding of its causative mechanisms. Identification, validation and comprehension of these mechanisms will help stratify these patients into distinct clinical phenotypes, improving disease management, increasing quality of life and reducing socioeconomic costs. In particular, we will deliver specific comorbid-IBS physiopathological knowledge as clinical guides and protocols for newly created, hospital-based, transversal and multidisciplinary units for implementing personalized management and wellbeing of European citizens and to position Europe as a global leader in comorbid IBS personalised medicine. We will also deliver prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers and patents, technological innovation via e-health tools for personalized assessment of clinical/nutritional/physical activity and disseminate new knowledge widely. Impact will be assessed by recording media presence, scientific publications and by monitoring health-related quality of life of patients and promoting cost-effective care. To this end we have created a user board involving patient associations, clinical specialists, European healthcare experts, large pharma and SMEs representatives. We will also promote the creation of a European Reference Network for comorbid IBS involving healthcare providers across Europe.",0,0
25,208113,Yes,"Context, Identity and Choice: Understanding the constraints on women's career decisions","There has been vast improvement in workplace gender equality, but there remain marked differences in the roles in which women and men work. Explanations for this inequality have focused on the barriers women face. However, as women begin to enter male-dominated roles, a new explanation has arisen: that remaining gender inequality must reflect fundamental differences between women and men, including differences in (a) ambition and desire for power, (b) needs for work-life balance, and (c) willingness to take career risks. Central to this analysis is the assumption that the glass ceiling is broken and thus inequality must be due to women’s active choices. This explanation downplays the fact that social context continues to be a barrier to women’s success and places responsibility for gender inequality on women themselves. Indeed, there has arisen the suggestion that gender equality necessitates women overcoming ‘internal obstacles’, ‘leaning-in’ and altering their choices (Sandberg, 2013), rather than challenging the status quo. I argue that diametrically contrasting structural barriers with women’s choices is unhelpful. Instead, I suggest that women’s choices are shaped and constrained by the gendered nature of organisational and social contexts and how women see themselves within these contexts. I propose a programme of research, across 3 integrated streams, that investigates how social and organisational structures define identities and constrain women’s choices in relation to ambition, work-life balance, and career risk-taking. I have four key objectives: (1) to clarify how organisational and social contexts define identity and constrain women’s choices, (2) to use an interdisciplinary, multi-methodological approach, to produce innovative theory and data, (3) to work collaboratively with stakeholders, and (4) to inform practical interventions designed to facilitate the increase of women’s participation in hitherto male-dominated roles.",1,1
1037,195594,No,Developing next-generation tools for mitochondrial dissection with cell-specific resolution.,"Mitochondria generate most of the energy cells require to function. Deficits in the mitochondrial energy-generating machinery affect 1:5,000 children and cause progressive, debilitating, and usually fatal pathologies collectively known as primary mitochondrial disease. To date, there is no cure for mitochondrial disease and existing treatments are highly ineffective and mostly palliative. High-energy-requiring cells, such as neurons, are especially affected in mitochondrial disease.  However, not all neuronal populations are equally affected. Furthermore, the molecular determinants of neuronal vulnerability to mitochondrial disease have not been adequately elucidated, representing a challenge for the development of efficient treatments for these pathologies. To improve on current knowledge on mitochondrial disease and to provide better therapeutic targets, this proposal focuses on developing ground-breaking molecular biology tools that will allow the identification and dissection of the molecular determinants of neuronal vulnerability in mitochondrial disease with unprecedented definition. I will develop novel techniques to isolate the mitochondrial translatome by using ribosomal tagging, as well as to assess intact mitochondrial function, with cell-type specificity. These novel approaches will have a high impact in mitochondrial disease research, with the overall aim of identifying novel therapeutic targets that will lead to effective treatments for mitochondrial disease. Furthermore, the high applicability of the tools generated will allow significant breakthroughs in the research of other pathologies with mitochondrial affectation such as diabetes or neurodegenerative processes.",0,0
319,83849,No,The linguistic and cognitive processing of space in signed and spoken language,"The project investigates the relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive processes in a comparison of spoken and signed language. Because signed and spoken languages differ with respect to the use of iconicity (i.e. visually motivated forms), comparison between language modalities can provide valuable insight into the nature of the interface between different cognitive processes. Specifically, the project focuses on the dimensions of size, shape, and location and seeks to explore effects of differences in the linguistic treatment of these domains in spoken and signed languages on visuospatial cognitive processes. In an interdisciplinary approach combining linguistic and psycholinguistic methodologies, we will assess signers and speakers linguistic coding of these spatial dimensions to investigate the effect of linguistic structure on conceptual representation. Crucially, this study will take into account differences in both modality and language typology (i.e. variation between languages) to examine their relative contribution.  The project will: (1) document and classify the use of structural devices in signed and spoken language in the spatial domain, (2) evaluate the effects on memory and attention of different linguistic treatment of spatial information in signed and spoken language in a cross-disciplinary approach, and (3) gain insight into the relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive processing.  The results will enhance our understanding of the language and cognition interface and will have implications for both linguistics and psychology.

Our breakthrough research will focus on the development, pre-clinical and clinical validation, and industrial demonstration of a unique all optical cancer prognostic system that will determine presence of cancer cells in the breast lymph nodes and characterize them, which correlates with presence of metastasis and bad prognosis. HypoSens prognostic system will consist of a non-invasive Near-infrared imaging device able to register signals through scattering media enabled by the implementation of wavefront shaping,that will process data collected by injected tumour-targeted body antibody functionalised nano-particles containing porphyrin sensors that will determine local oxygen concentration and local temperature distribution in the cancer cells.The HypoSens imaging system is strategically designed to offer a non-invasive alternative to the Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy,the current surgical procedure for breast cancer staging. With an approximate cost of 60,000€ per device unit and additional 5,000€ per patient, the device is an affordable, accurate, easy to use prognostic solution for clinicians towards more accurate and fast diagnostics and personalised treatment options.The initial target of the project is metastatic breast cancer, with potential later involvement in other cancer markets, e.g. vulval, renal, colorectal, gastric etc (via the use of different tumor-targeting moiety).With an estimated 1.7 million new cases each year, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide.Its low cost will enable a wide and fast take-up by clinicians and hospitals leading to an important reduction of the economic and societal burden related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",0,0

538,84370,No,Ascending placentitis in the horse - involvement of sialidases and mucinases,"Ireland is Europe's largest producer of thoroughbreds, accounting for 42% of EU total output. The thoroughbred broodmare industry contributes 198.4 million euro to the Irish economy per annum. From 18000 broodmares at stud in 2003, only 11000 foals were produced in 2004. This poor reproductive performance stems largely from infection ascending into the uterus from the vagina and poor clearance of this infection. In humans, the normal flora of the tract and the mucociliary apparatus play major roles in prevention and clearance of infection in the reproductive tract. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women is a condition in which abnormal bacteria that colonize the reproductive tract during pregnancy produce enzymes which degrade mucus, breeching the cervical mucus barrier. Resulting ascending infection of the fetal membranes leads to preterm birth.  Ascending placentitis (AP) is an apparently analogous condition in broodmares, which causes major losses to the equine industry from abortion, birth of weak, septic foals and delayed return to breeding. As yet, the normal flora and the main polymeric constituents of the mucus of the mare reproductive tract, the mucin-glycoproteins (mucins), are uncharacterised. Mucinase production by equine reproductive pathogens has not been investigated. We will characterise mucin gene expression in the mare reproductive tract during the oestrus cycle and pregnancy. Expression of mucins in other species is affected by hormone status. Therefore, blood samples will be collected at the time of tissue sampling for hormone assay. The normal flora and pH of the mare's reproductive tract will be characterized and compared with the flora and pH observed during ascending placentitis. We will attempt to detect bacterial markers of ascending placentitis in the mare.",0,0
143,198287,Yes,GRACE: Gender and Cultures of Equality in Europe,"The aim of the GRACE (Gender and Cultures of Equality in Europe) project is to systematically investigate the cultural production of gender equalities within Europe. Extending the success of GEMMA, the Erasmus Mundus ‘Masters of Excellence’ in Women’s and Gender Studies, the central objective of GRACE is to become the programme of reference for innovative interdisciplinary doctoral training for early career researchers. Previous scholarly work focuses on European gender equality policies. GRACE draws on innovative and interdisciplinary methodologies to investigate an under-examined aspect of those processes, namely the production of cultures of equality that underpin, enable and constrain those changing policy and legislative frameworks. Our methodological approach understands culture as neither normative frameworks nor ways of representing the world, but more fundamentally as the process through which people create the worlds they inhabit. The GRACE project will recruit, employ and provide advanced training for 15 ESRs who will research the production of cultures of gender equality across five specific sites where cultures of gender equalities are produced and contested by differently situated social agents. These five sites form the core of our research and training Work Packages, and are focused as follows: mediated cultures of gender equality (WP 1); urban cultures of gender equality (WP 2); intellectual and activist cultures of gender equality (WP 3); textual and artistic cultures of gender equality (WP 4); employing cultures of gender equality (WP 5). In sum, GRACE is designed to: equip the next generation of ESRs to play a leading role in developing advanced techniques for investigating the production of cultures of gender equality; translate creative and critical capacities into innovative cultural practices within and beyond academia; and enable them to take up positions as experts in producing new gender equalities cultures.",1,1

If successful, the app would: (1) increase access to mental health care by providing links to relevant existing services; (2) increase access to relevant evidence-based mobile health interventions and to address barriers to care and (3) allow individuals to review services they have used and provide feedback which can be accessed by other app users.  Insufficient awareness of available services and treatments and how to access them, and the stigma associated with using treatment, are two of the most significant barriers to mental health care for young people. As part of the ongoing ERC  APPLAUSE project, we have already collected data from a prospective community cohort of young people and found that among those with mental health problems, 40% wanted help but were not aware of how to get it. Thus, despite perceived need, many young people fail to find support.  The ERC APPLAUSE project cohort provides us with a unique opportunity to understand how and whether the app can change service use patterns. We will randomise cohort participants with mental health problems to intervention and control conditions in order to understand changes in service use in addition to estimating short- and long-term economic impacts associated with the app intervention.  Treatment can enormously improve outcomes for young people with mental health problems. Mental health problems experienced by young people can have many and often serious adverse effects, both early on and across the life-course. This app could help improve access to intervention and support, and hence alter developmental trajectories in a way that could improve the lives of these individuals and generate immediate as well as longer-term societal and economic benefits.",0,0
660,96015,No,"COMMUNITIES, GOVERNANCE AND PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN AMAZONIA","This proposal is for a study of the local governance implications of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), especially hydrological services, in the Amazon basin. Such payments, which may also take the form of development projects, compensate local actors for the opportunity costs of maintaining their rainforest environment through sustainable practices - in the case of indigenous peoples in Amazonia, this implies maintaining traditional livelihoods. As PES are increasingly accepted as a solution for REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) in the context of international negotiations over measures to reduce the harmful effects of climate change, there is an increasing trend for such payments to be made on an international scale. PES is therefore quickly becoming a significant international development model. However, for it to be effective in reducing deforestation and therefore in mitigating climate change, and for it effectively to reduce poverty and improve wellbeing, it is vital that problems of local governance in the remote rainforest regions concerned by PES be well understood. However, no previous primary research has focused on the sociopolitical and governance implications of REDD projects. The fellow, a social anthropologist, will collaborate with an expert in environmental governance to gather original data on PES projects in Amazonia and develop a theoretical framework for studying the problems of environmental governance that they raise. He will produce three articles and a monograph, organise an international conference, and issue policy recommendations based on the research results. In addition to research training, he will gain interdisciplinary skills (training in political ecology) and organisational, collaborative and intersectoral experience (by collaborating with international development organisations), which will prepare him for a leading position at the interface of academia and international development practice.",0,0
468,94850,No,Development of universal vaccinal dendritic cells lines for cancer treatment,"The development of efficient vaccines for the treatment of cancers is a major public health issue but remains a challenge. The induction of cytotoxic specific T cell able to recognize and lyse malignant cells is the main goal of immunotherapeutic strategies based on dendritic cells. The fellow has developed a unique cell line (GEN2.2) from the new Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell (PDC) type. He demonstrated its tremendous potential in allogeneic setting to induce the activation and proliferation of specific efficient cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro (melanoma patients’ samples) and in vivo (preclinical humanized mouse model). Allogeneic PDCs therefore represents a new promising immunotherapeutic strategy to fight cancer. The project aims to create a set of universal “off-the-shelf” dendritic cell lines based on GEN2.2. The current strategy is based on irradiated GEN2.2 loaded with immunogenic peptides derived from tumor antigen presented by HLA-A*0201 allele. This strategy, however, is limited to the patients with the corresponding HLA allele and to the known peptides chemically synthesized. In collaboration with the University College London, the fellow proposes to improve this vaccine strategy by engineering genetically modified cell lines, either coding for i) the antigenic peptide to avoid the loading step, ii) the antigens as the whole protein to enlarge the spectrum of presented peptides, or iii) other HLA class I antigens to target a larger number of patients. This project is ambitious and in the scope of the developments in the immunotherapeutic field. It proposes to enlarge the patient population and the cancers for which this new and promising strategy could be used. The Marie Curie Action proposed here is an adequate opportunity for the fellow to overcome his weaknesses (genetic engineering, English language) and increase his international renown to develop his projects involving genetic aspects and to gain leadership skills for managing European projects.",0,0
778,215124,No,Deciphering the role of astrocytes in chronic depression.,"Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects 1 in 7 people worldwide. Despite coordinated efforts from researchers and clinicians alike, the neurobiological substrates of depression remain largely unknown. As a result, therapeutic options against depression are inadequate. Using a valid preclinical model, I recently demonstrated that depression alters the molecular composition of astrocytes and the organization of extracellular matrix (ECM), an assembly of molecules that are primarily synthesized and released by astrocytes. This results in disrupted information relay in the hippocampus and in cognitive impairment, both commonly seen in depressed patients. Thus, my work suggests a role of astrocytic (dys)function in the depressive state.  In the proposed project, I aim to unravel the contribution of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of depression. First, I will address how the depressive state affects astrocyte proteome, morphology and function. Second, I will address the role of astrocytes and astrocyte-derived ECM in the manifestation of depression at the molecular, cellular and the behavioural level.  To reach my goals, I will make use of genetically engineered mice that allow for visualization, metabolic labeling and targeting of astrocytes. These mice will be subjected to social defeat to induce a chronic depressive state. I will study astrocyte morphology, physiology and proteome alterations in depressed mice vs. controls. After establishing astrocyte-specific changes, I will employ i) viral vector-assisted silencing of the expression of astrocytic genes contributing to the ECM and ii) designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)-assisted modulation of astrocyte activity. I will then assess whether these interventions can ameliorate the depressive state. With this integrative approach I aim to uncover novel molecular pathways mediating the depressive state and to identify new targets for the treatment of depression.",0,0
824,108179,No,Emerging infectious disease and population genetic structure,"Emerging infectious diseases are increasing worldwide, and have been implicated in population declines and species extinctions. We know that diseases can cause major changes to the genetic composition of host populations through selection and population declines, and in turn that such changes can influence the impact of disease on host populations. We also know that diseases can lead to changes in mate choice behaviour which can alter the population structure, again influencing the impact of disease - yet this has as yet received little attention. This proposal focuses on investigating the interactions between genes, behaviour, and disease, using a model system of Ranavirus (an EU notifiable disease known to be contributing to amphibian declines) in common frogs (Rana temporaria) in the UK. Transcriptomics will be used to gain an understanding of which genes are involved in the host response in the wild to Ranavirus, and controlled laboratory experiments will be used to determine whether these genes are also involved in offspring survivorship. Sequencing of candidate genes in individuals will be used to examine how genotype influences parental mate choice, and the resulting fitness consequences of mate choice on the offspring will be determined. Furthermore, this proposal provides the foundations for a long-term study on how host genotype changes throughout the progression of an epidemic. As such, this proposal addresses fundamental scientific questions relating to the impact of disease on populations, which is critical for our understanding of the wider evolutionary impacts of disease and so for improving our ability to manage such emerging diseases. In addition, this research will directly improve our knowledge of an important driver of global amphibian declines",0,0
558,222269,No,Machine learning prediction for breast cancer therapy,"Breast cancer is the cancer with the highest incidence in women worldwide, and is the leading cause of cancer-related death, mainly due to treatment resistance. Recently, tumor heterogeneity has been described as one of the key driver in treatment failure. Indeed, tumor is not a homogeneous entity to treat, but a complex association of subclonal populations driven by their own genetic alterations, and immune and stromal cells from microenvironment. Breast cancer subtypes and tumor heterogeneity advocate for the development of tailored, personalized treatments, but so far, the discovery of efficient predictive markers has been compromised by the lack of adapted biological models and methodological tools. The recent developments of high-throughput methods for bulk and single-cell analyses has generated large ‘omics’ datasets from patients, stored in open access databases (ArrayExpress, GEO). Combining these numerous datasets will grant a sufficient statistical power to reveal a comprehensive overview of tumor complexity. However, this data mining is currently limited by methodological challenges like cross-platform normalization and the difficulty to analyze complex data structure with high dimension observations. To overcome these issues, I propose to implement a multidisciplinary project at the interface between mathematics, biology, and information technologies.  With the support of the mathematicians and bioinformaticians from the Bioinfomics unit of the regional comprehensive cancer center (ICO), I will develop and implement machine-learning algorithms in the search of predictive biomarkers for breast cancer treatment. This innovative strategy will lead to personalized medicine in breast cancer by guiding clinicians in the selection of the optimal therapeutic option. Moreover, this generated pipeline for predictive marker discovery could be further adapted for the treatment of other cancer types.",0,0
131,192003,Yes,A New Paradigm for Public Health Surveillance: Unlocking the Potential of Data to Empower Women and Health Systems,"Rationale: State of the art health registries, cornerstones of public health surveillance, have hardly capitalized on the information and communication technology revolution. Many continue to be static, fragmented, and passive data repositories disseminating outdated reports only to a closed loop of public health officials. Aim: In a radical departure from traditional science, this proposal introduces a new paradigm for public health surveillance: Maximizing the potential of data by disseminating data-driven individualized real-time information directly to women and providers to empower self-care in pregnancy and better healthcare delivery. Research question: Is routine, data-driven and automated feedback from a reproductive health registry (RHR) effective in improving health behaviour and quality of care? Plan: Based on the roll-out of a RHR in the Palestinian West Bank, four stepped wedged cluster randomized controlled trials will be undertaken to investigate the comparative effectiveness of a series of feedback modules to women and care providers. Main outcomes include adherence to evidence-based guidelines for providers, and self-care and care seeking among women. Impact: Coalescing with WHO/NIPH’s dissemination of the harmonized Reproductive Health Registries (hRHR) Initiative, the scientific horizons emerging from this proposal have potential for exceptional impact. Radically transforming public health surveillance by empowering women and health care providers with information can translate into better health care and behaviours thus saving lives.",0,1
570,91907,No,"The determinants of international migration: A theoretical and empirical assessment of policy, origin and destination effects","The main question of this research project is: how do migration policies of receiving and sending states affect the size, direction and nature of international migration to wealthy countries? The effectiveness of migration policies has been widely contested in the face of their apparent failure to steer immigration and their many unintended, perverse effects. Due to fundamental conceptual and methodological flaws, most empirical evidence has remained largely descriptive and biased by omitting crucial sending country and policy variables. This project answers this question by embedding the systematic empirical analysis of policy effects into a comprehensive theoretical framework of the macro and meso-level forces driving international migration to and from wealthy countries. This is achieved by linking separately evolved migration theories focusing on either sending or receiving countries and integrating them with theories on the internal dynamics of migration processes. A systematic review and categorisation of receiving and sending country migration policies will provide an improved operationalisation of policy variables. Subsequently, this framework will be subjected to quantitative empirical tests drawing on gross and bilateral (country-to-country) migration flow data, with a particular focus on Europe. Methodologically, this project is groundbreaking by introducing a longitudinal, double comparative approach by studying migration flows of multiple origin groups to multiple destination countries. This design enables a unique, simultaneous analysis of origin and destination country, network and policy effects. Theoretically, this research project is innovative by going beyond simple push-pull and equilibrium models and linking sending and receiving side, and economic and non-economic migration theory. This project is policy-relevant by improving insight in the way policies shape migration processes in their interaction with other migration determinants",0,0
630,32048,No,EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL NETWORK,"ENN proposes telematics support to slash the huge multi-billion ECU bill for annual treatment of headaches, sleep disorders and epilepsy in the EU. Efficient low-cost strategies to cope with these disorders are vital. With a view to developing them, the project will set up an international telematics-based network of neurological health care experts and resources to support the work of doctors in this field. They in turn will test the network and feed their own neurological case findings into its European data-base. Network cost-benefits will be assessed once the project is fully established.  Sleep disorders, headaches and epileptic disorders are common health problems in the EEC. The cost of treating these disorders is tremendous. Twenty billion ECUs are spent every year on headaches alone.  Sleep disturbances and snoring are even more common complaints, and epidemiological surveys indicate a large waste of human and financial resources to deal with these problems. The large outlay of public funds pays not only the medical expenses, but also the hidden cost of the professional and social impact of the above disorders due to absenteeism industrial and driving accidents, forced early retirement etc.  The imperative of the need for efficient, rational, low cost strategies to cope with these disorders is clear. The first priority is to appropriately educate health professionals throughout the community as how best to diagnose and treat these problems. However, the long term goal is to decrease health care expenses.  The project objective is the creation of a multimedia telematic network which can be distributed throughout the community. The ultimate goal of the project is the reduction of inappropriate expenses due to poor understanding and treatments of the above chronic ailments known to be widely distributed in the general EEC population. To achieve this ultimate goal, there must be creation of a knowledgeable force of health care providers throughout Europe. This knowledgeable force must have the support of experts and specialised laboratories.  The proposed network will encompass units located in different countries. The different units will participate in scientific exchanges aimed at developing and improving knowledge within their national borders as well as in the greater EEC. They will perform joint research and concerted efforts. These multinational collaborations are aimed at unified health care approaches and policies in the considered disorders. In the current proposal, twelve European health care providers will be involved. Diagnostic tools will be provided in each of the twelve countries and be widely available down to small centers and even individual patients' homes. The users of the network which will be developed, will be general practitioners (GPs) who will be the first to test the system and give feedback with respect to its efficacy. Users will be linked to experts. The overall network will bring to users tools that will improve diagnosis and treatment of the above health problems. Practically, the first users will consist of six groups distributed from northern to southern Europe located in the following areas: Tampere, Marburg, Paris, Bordeaux, Lisbon and the portuguese atlantic islands of the Azores. The users are faced with different cultural, social, and environmental demands that have to be evaluated continuously to develop the appropriate tools. They will associate with a multinational task force of multidisciplinary and multicentric experts who must provide appropriate responses to the users questions.  The outputs of the project will be: the realisation of an European neurological network data-base derived from users' case report; the creation of a tutorial for education of users on the indicated health problems; the creation of expert systems to bring immediate help for general practice of users as far as diagnosis and treatment are concerned; the creation of a communications network to allow users access to the above, and the experts through teleconsulting and other means. The proposed project will require creation of the above elements, validation of the prototypes by experts and assessment of their case of use, and appropriateness for users needs.  Finally, once the project is established the knowledge of users and the amount of support derived from utilisation of the network by users; as well as the cost-benefits brought by utilisation of the network will be evaluated.",0,0

679,83853,No,Characterisation of the structure of the early oligomeric aggregates on the amyloidogenic pathway of lysozyme,"Aberrant folding and aggregation of soluble proteins into amyloid-like deposits has been associated to more than 20 known human disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, spongiform encephalopathies and type II diabetes. Recent research has indicated that the early oligomers present prior to amyloid fibril formation represent the most dangerous species to the cell and that their specific conformational properties determine their toxicity. It has been therefore realised that the structural characterization of these oligomers represents a crucial step in the development of treatments for diseases associated with abnormal protein aggregation.  This objective, however, presents formidable challenges, due to the transient lifetime and the heterogeneous nature of such oligomeric species. In this fellowship application we propose to exploit the ability of specific antibodies to bind the early oligomeric aggregates of lysozyme in order to characterise structurally the initial steps of its amyoidogenic pathways. The camel single domain antibody, cAb-HUL5, significantly inhibits fibril formation in lysozyme by stabilising dimers or early oligomers, thus effectively preventing them from being incorporated into higher order oligomers and fibrils. These antibody-bound dimers will be characterised by advanced NMR methods and the structural information acquired in this way will subsequently be used in structure calculations.  We will thus be able to obtain for the first time an ensemble of structures representing the conformations populated by the antibody-bound dimeric state of lysozyme. The results of this project will clarify important fundamental aspects of the early stages of the processes of fibril formation and aggregation of proteins, and offer a basis for the development of therapeutic strategies for several debilitating diseases associated with protein aggregation.",0,0
775,220677,No,Navigating lymphatic formation and function  in health and disease,"For many years, lymphatic vessels have been viewed as inert fluid conduits whose open structure allows for passive flow of antigens, proteins and cells from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs. Yet, recent discoveries highlighting novel functions and heterogeneous origins of the lymphatic endothelium, call for reevaluation of the passive lymphatic-vessel paradigm. During the past decade, we have used the zebrafish (ZF) to detail the cellular and molecular events underlying the development of the lymphatic system. Our discoveries have greatly contributed to our understanding of the origins, specification and mechanisms of formation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the developing embryo. In line with our past achievements, we now aim towards novel directions- to transform the adult ZF into an equally convenient model for the study of lymphatic diversity. The overall goal of LymphMap is to reveal the multiple regulatory levels that coordinate the formation and functionality of lymphatic vessels in health and disease. To this end, we will carry out a comprehensive research program characterizing four distinct aspects of lymphatic biology:  1.Cellular origins and molecular signature of LECs 2.Formation and specialization of organotypic lymphatics  3.Lymphatic vessels during organ regeneration  4.Lymphatic involvement in human disease  Our experimental strategy involves the combination of high-resolution imaging, global expression profiling and regeneration models in adult ZF, with analyses of human-derived LECs in various clinical settings. The important and unique aspects of our approach are the focus on in vivo dynamics, and the cross-organ comparative analysis, which will likely provide the much-needed knowledge on lymphatic diversity in health and disease. When completed, we anticipate that this work will be part of a new paradigm – no longer perceiving lymphatics as passive bystanders, but rather as orchestrators of tissue morphogenesis and regeneration.",0,0
329,100788,No,Equal opportunities for migrant youth in educational systems with high levels of social and ethnic segregation: assessing the impact of school team resources,"Although a gap in educational performance of migrant children compared to children without a migration background is to be observed in most industrialized countries, it is particularly big in countries as Belgium, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, as has been attested by the PISA-data. Social and ethnic segregation, which is particularly high in these educational systems, seems to be one of the important explanatory factors. This project wants to disentangle what are the crucial factors by which this high level of segregation impacts on unequal opportunities for immigrant children. Going beyond the classic composition effect model (looking at peer group effects, i.e. positive or negative influences of pupils on each other), this project wants to also examine the potential impact of differentiated teacher profiles on group performance. The project wishes to test the hypothesis that the link between school composition and educational performance is a (partly) spurious effect, caused by mediating effect of teacher characteristics. We hypothesize that better skilled and more positively oriented teachers are overrepresented in schools with an 'easier' school population, while so-called 'difficult' schools (populated by working-class immigrant children) have difficulty in attracting and - especially - keeping competent and motivated staff. In order to examine this hypothesis a mixed methods approach will be used, combining quantitative statistical analysis (on new and existing data, for instance multi-level analysis of the PISA-data set and other eligible datasets), qualitative case studies and focus groups. Secondary analysis of existing data-sets (PISA, TIMMS, PIRLS) will be undertaken and new data will be collected (taking the Flemish and Francophone educational systems in Belgium as case-studies).",0,0
890,221803,No,Leave No One Behind: Youth in Protracted Crises,"Effective humanitarian programs are predicated on a detailed and accurate understanding of what is happening on the ground. So often, however, humanitarian organizations do not have access to such information, and they lack the in-house capacity to conduct empirical research in conflict-affected areas. This gap—between generating scientifically grounded knowledge and engaging in humanitarian action— results in programs that are ineffective or misaligned with the needs of crisis-affected populations on the ground. The proposed project Leave No One Behind will bridge this gap by bringing together an academic researcher with a non-governmental humanitarian organization to conduct research primarily on a vulnerable population-- adolescent girls—who are living in protracted displacement and fragile environments. Leave No One Behind seeks to answer the following overarching research questions using quantitative and qualitative methodologies 1) What are the push and pull factors for early marriage in fragile environments and what are potential local solutions to decrease this practice? 2) What are the decision-making processes of refugee families with adolescents and unaccompanied minors who seek to integrate locally or return to their country of origin and what could support durable solutions? The research will be conducted in the Sahel region of Africa and Lebanon with the support of the host organization that currently has a presence in both regions. Leave No One Behind represents an applied research, based on identified needs,  that will generate recommendations that are immediately actionable by the host organization, as well as local and international organizations involved in humanitarian action, advocacy, and policy. Beyond the actual research project, Leave No One Behind comprises a host of skills and continuous knowledge transfers between the researcher and the organization throughout the fellowship including two-way trainings, workshops, and regular consultation",0,0
1107,96245,No,The spread of pathogens in social networks: a field study,"In recent years, there have been a growing number of attempts to study wildlife diseases from an ecological perspective and to understand their dynamics and evolution in wild populations. But although there is now an increasing awareness of the impact of disease pathogens on the dynamics, structure and genetic diversity of wild host populations, empirical knowledge of the factors affecting transmission of pathogens in natural host populations is still lacking. The vast majority of theoretical models of disease evolution assume that all individual hosts have an equal likelihood of encountering infection. In many natural populations, this assumption is unrealistic because the number of potential contacts of a given host is finite, which leads to heterogeneity in the risk of infection among individuals. To date, most studies of disease transmission in social networks have focused on human populations, where complete and reliable social network data are difficult to obtain. As a consequence, current knowledge on the spread of pathogens within social networks mostly comes from theoretical models. Good datasets associating social network structure, spatial information and epidemiological data are now needed. Here I propose a multidisciplinary project aimed at the transmission routes of pathogens in populations of two model species of territorial hole-nesting birds. the project has the double aim of testing the extent to which social interactions among individuals affect the transmission of pathogens, and of using social network data to acquire knowledge on when and where individuals get infected by pathogens. We will focus on two kinds of pathogens. First, we will apply these questions to bacterial communities living in and on birds. Second, we will also focus on avian malarial parasites (genus Plasmodium), which are particularly well characterized at the study site.",0,0
846,89591,No,Britons and their Pasts,"This project builds upon international research exploring the ways people connect with the past, for example through family history, hobbies or visits to museums. Based upon a series of national surveys, this previous research showed that family history and museums were identified as the most trusted forms of historical information. However, the methodologies employed in the national surveys limited the extent to which researchers could discover what information about the past participants were receiving from these trusted sources, or the uses to which this information was being put by individuals. Through a random sample of thirty-six in-depth oral history interviews, across three generational cohorts, this project will investigate the ways in which family histories, museum exhibitions and audio-visual media frame popular understandings of the past. The construction of family history in memory, and the role family narrative plays in shaping the individual’s ‘historical consciousness’ - the ways in which the past, present and future are cognitively and symbolically linked - will be a major focus of the project. In a context where history is an integral component of contemporary political debates but adults recall their alienation from history as a subject at school, the wider questions that animate this study are relevant and timely. To what extent do family counter-narratives shape historical consciousness among the population at large, and what role do these counter narratives play in contemporary political perspectives? And secondly, is it possible to build a more participatory historical culture than exists at present, one that attracts popular interest while engaging with the past in a critical and constructive way? This research is intended as a pilot project for a larger national survey and oral history of historical consciousness",0,0

86,222271,Yes,Capitalising Public Narratives in the organising of Grassroots Roma Women,"In contrast to what social imaginary portrays, Roma women are not passive in regard to the racial and gender-based discrimination they face across Europe. They participate in various forms of political and social activism through Roma women-led civic associations, slightly achieving more representation in higher structures of power. Despite on-going mobilisations, the Roma women’s movement has faced obstacles that prevented it from being better organised. Scant scientific literature has yet analysed how existing networks of solidarity, support, or respectful listening between Roma women and other non-Roma allies, can be turned into a better-organised movement and contribute to a better strategic process as a way to enforce Roma and Roma women’s fundamental rights. Conceived as a qualitative research, Narratives4Change project will study what has been theorised as “Public Narratives”, an effective leadership practice for community organising that is used worldwide. The project’s main goal will be to examine Public Narrative as a promising theoretical and practical model of the leadership practice and organising, inquiring on how when applied by civic associations it contributes to activate members’ agency and their strategic capacity to achieve social and political impact. Special attention will be granted to those civic associations working in the field of education, health and gender equality, mainly with at-risk social groups. Drawing on this analysis, Narratives4Change will contribute novel knowledge about the conditions that need to exist in order for the Public Narrative model be capitalised by Roma women associations in Spain, informing how to advance in better organising the Roma women movement in Europe. Its theoretical contributions are of major relevance for Europe in current times.

370,96722,No,Social Information Processing and Exposure to Political Violence: Relations to Maladaptive Behavior in Preschool Children,"The project proposed here aims to expand our understanding of the origins of maladjusted behaviors in children exposed to political violence by examining the complex set of links among levels of exposure to political violence, Social Information Processing patterns, and disruptive behavior in preschool children in Israel. Exposure to political violence refers here to constant and unpredictable exposure to rocket attacks which are the result of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict; Social Information Processing (SIP) refers to the internal representational processes that guide social behavior; finally, disruptive behaviors refer to the externalizing and internalizing symptoms of preschool children. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first time that SIP is investigated in children exposed to political violence. The following hypotheses will be tested in this study: a) more exposure to both political violence and to violence at the home will be related to less adaptive SIP patterns. However, it is expected that because of the differences between the two types of exposure, the distortion in SIP patterns may be exhibited in different processes (i.e., SIP steps); b) less adaptive SIP patterns will be related to higher externalizing and internalizing problems; c) SIP will mediate the link between violence exposure and preschool children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors; and d) the quality of the mother-child relationship and the parents' psychological functioning will have a moderating affect on the complex set of links between exposure to political violence, SIP, and problem behavior. In other words, the relationships between exposure and SIP and problem behavior will be weaker in families characterized with higher dyadic emotional availability and in families where parents report of lower levels of psychological symptoms.",0,0
691,103861,No,Development of spoken language comprehension processes in a verb-final language: Incremental interpretation of case marking cues in Turkish speaking children,"In the last two decades methods have been developed to investigate moment-by-moment language comprehension in children. This research demonstrates that children’s language comprehension shares two crucial features with adults’: 1) interpretation is incremental such that each word is integrated as soon as it becomes available; 2) language comprehension at every level draws on multiple sources of information. But there is much left to learn, particularly about processes by which children combine word meanings to interpret sentences. Previous work that was mostly on rigid word-order languages like English has tended to emphasize that children’s comprehension is verb-based. The crucial question is whether the same mechanism is employed in verb-final languages. Adults in such languages have been shown to use case marking cues incrementally independent of the verb. To date, it is not clear whether children follow similar patterns. The present studies explore children’s real-time language comprehension in Turkish, a verb-final language with flexible word order and rich inflection. These studies will provide information about the sources and processes employed in comprehension, how they vary from language to language, and how they develop in early childhood. The proposal presents 3 experiments in the visual-world eye-tracking paradigm, which will be employed for the first time with Turkish-speaking children, to investigate when they develop the ability to use case marking cues to (A) predict how a sentence will unfold as it is being spoken (Experiment 1 & 2); and (B) make inferences about the verbal semantics of an event (completed/ongoing) (Experiment 3a & 3b). The main training objective of this research is to equip a European researcher with an expertise about the design, implementation, and analysis of the visual-world eye-tracking paradigm to become a competent user and trainer of this advanced methodology and to increase its availability in European psycholinguistics.",0,0
88,194329,Yes,The European network of Women web Entrepreneurs Hubs,"It is generally acknowledged that the web entrepreneurship sector can contribute significantly to the competiveness and economic growth of countries and regions.  However, Europe is clearly lagging behind given that even though there are lots of European web start-ups, most of them rarely grow up to become global leaders. In this context, the position of women seems particularly weak given that only a very small percentage of them are web entrepreneurs.   Taking into account the limited development of web entrepreneurship in Europe as well as the limited participation of women in the web economy the WeHubs project seeks to create a favourable environment for women web entrepreneurs, by linking together local fragmented ecosystems nodes, and foster networking and exploitation of synergies, into the first European Network for Women Web Entrepreneurs Hubs.  In this respect the project is aimed at providing a strong support to women web entrepreneurs and existing web entrepreneur’s ecosystems enabling the latter to provide dedicated services to women.   As a result the project will foster the creation and scaling of web start-ups created by women (impact on women), strengthen the existing web entrepreneurs ecosystems through networking and complementary services (impact on ecosystems) and support the emergence of a dynamic European ecosystem for women web entrepreneurs contributing to the formulation of relevant policies, support the implementation of start-up Europe initiative and the wider enforcement of the European digital sector (policy impact).",1,1
107,185530,Yes,Gendered  dimensions in ERC grant selection – gendERC,"The project will analyze the ERC practices and processes in the contect of gender mainstreaming especially during submission of proposals and in peer review processes. The main objective of this project is to identify and analyze gender biases related to different stages of the application and evaluation process within the ERC. Avoiding gender biases is essential to guarantee excellence and gender fairness. Therefore we will review official ERC documents, analyze the selection procedures and practices for reviewers and to study the mechanisms and practices related to peer review processes. For this purpose it is necessary to apply a set of different qualitative and quantitative methods and to assemble a research consortium which comprises the specific competences and resources needed. The results will be delivered and presented in form which allows to feed them into the strategic orientations of the Scientific Council and to apply them to the ERC´s operations.In this project, we investigate the extent and sources of gender bias in grant reviewing schemes, using ERC Starting Grants and Advanced Grants as case studies. The project focuses on the three main aspects of the schemes: the formal requirements and procedures, the composition of the reviewers and panels, and the process of application and evaluation. More specifically the following questions are answered: (i) Does the application process lead to gendered self-selection? (ii) Where in the selection process are (potentially) gender-biased  decisions made? (iii) Are the decision criteria gender-biased, and/or are they deployed in a gender-biased manner? (iv) To what extent is this due to the (gender or topical biased) composition of the panels and/or reviewers?",0,1
374,82021,No,IP flows over optical and wireless,"Despite the fact that the telecommunications and data networks are in an economic down-turn, this industry remains critical to the economic future of the world. Although it is clear that all future networks will be based on the Internet protocol (IP), there are many technical and business issues that remain open.  Proper solutions to those open issues are critical for the recovery of the telecom industry, which consequently motivated this research proposal. This proposed research and development project is focused on several IP packets flow issues through IP networks, from the optical core to the wireless edges. Thus, this project is called: IP Flows over Optical and Wireless or IP-FLOW.  In general, there are two issues concerning the transport of IP packets: (1) routing - determining the path a packet travels on from source to destination, and (2) flow control ('flow' for short)-how a packet is forwarded (and stored), primarily with respect to time, along the selected path. The Chair candidate, Dr. Ofek, is a world-class expert in data network flow control, timing and synchronization, and therefore, the proposed research will focus on the second issue regarding the flow of IP packets.  Timing and flow control are critical since they directly affect how users perceived the quality of IP applications, such as, streaming media, and how much they are willing to pay for such applications. Thus, the proposed research will establish a centre, in the host institute, to investigate of all aspects of IP flows and timing.  The IP-FLOW project will have three research areas: Research Area 1-UTC-based pipeline forwarding for IP flows for solving switch and link bottlenecks; Research Area 2-TrustedFlow: a general method for run-time authentication that guarantees correct execution of service level agreements and window flow control; and Research Area 3-Broadband GLOW for delivering high fidelity content using IP flows over wireless (Wi-Fi) to consumers with handheld devices.",0,0
129,203536,Yes,Gender Equality Plans for Information Sciences and Technology Research Institutions,"EQUAL-IST aims at introducing structural changes to enhance gender equality within Information Systems and Technology Research institutions, which have been demonstrated to be among the research sectors most affected by gender inequalities at all levels. The project aims at supporting seven RPOs from Northern, Southern and Central European countries plus a CSI country, in developing and implementing Gender Equality Action Plans. All the 7 RPOs of the EQUAL-IST consortium are at a starting stage in the setting up of GEPs and they have also ensured the support of the highest management levels both from their faculties and university as whole.  The project will combine gender mainstreaming and positive actions on 3 main levels: HR practices and management processes, research design and delivery, student services and institutional communication. For addressing and solving issues of horizontal and vertical segregation in research and administrative careers, work life balance, gender neutral-blind approaches to IST research, gender gaps in students’ enrollment, EQUAL-IST will try to operate at the same time on organizational structures, discourses and behaviors. In addition, EQUAL-IST will promote a participatory approach towards Gender Equality Policies based on co-design and at the same time ensuring the active dialogue with and involvement of top decision makers at the partner RPOs. By setting up a dedicated crowdsourcing- online collaborative platform the project will support both the initial internal assessment of the RPOs and the GEPs design process. EQUAL-IST toolkits and guidelines, lessons learned and used methodologies will be disseminated broadly in Europe and other CSI countries with a communication strategy focused on IST Research Institutions and RFOs and through collaboration with the EURAXESS network, in order to support ERA objectives in relation to gender equality in research.",1,1
390,84362,No,Physiological basis of learning and memory processes in the brain,"The proposed project concerns synaptic plasticity in relation to learning and memory. This area of research is important both for human health and basic biomedical research. Memory is essential for human identity and our ability to function socially. Its loss is amongst the most devastating aspects of brain disorders such as epilepsy, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.  A better understanding of normal memory may lead to better treatment of memory disorders. Spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity ( STDP) is a strong candidate mechanism, obeying the theoretical predictions made by Donald Hebb and sharing mechanisms with long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as long-term depression (LTD).  Two objectives are identified: - To establish whether spike timing-dependent potentiation and depression can be dissociated by NMDA receptor-subunit-selective drugs, and - to investigate the differences in Ca2\ transients induced by activation of these receptors.  The first objective would be met by conventional whole-cell patch-clamp recordings during current clamp from CA1 pyramidal neurones in rat hippocampal slices. The second objective would be met by Ca2\ imaging using confocal microscopy. Hippocampal LTP remains our best model of those synaptic changes that might underlie behavioural memory.  The recent discovery that distinct subunits of the NMDA receptor are necessary for induction of respectively LTP and LTD suggests a novel way to manipulate the conditions in ways that should favour either of these types of plasticity. We intend to use this approach to control the direction of plasticity and investigate the corresponding [Ca2\] changes.  If spike timing-dependent synaptic potentiation and depression can be dissociated pharmacologically, a more detailed investigation into their possible involvement during behavioural memory would be possible, as well as their possible involvement in brain disorders such as epilepsy and excitotoxicity.",0,0

Work description: The work will start by identifying the requirements of the users in the consortium, as well as those of a wider community. These requirements will then be traced into technical specifications, both of the system as a whole and of the individual modules. An accurate analysis of the evidenced user needs and system requirements will be the next step. The final result will be a system architectural design that follows the UML Methodology.  The development of the DISTRICT 1st Prototype will be done on the basis of the previous Analysis and Design work already mentioned. It will be carried out the implementation and integration of all the DISTRICT modules: user profiling, logistics, business management and other services depending on the specific site.  An Evaluation Plan will be produced in order to define the evaluation methodology to be used later in the project. Three main stages are envisaged: identification of stakeholders, quantification of cost benefits and the analysis of the evaluation.  The development of the first prototype will be evaluated in laboratory conditions. Issues as the integration of the modules, the compliance of the operation of the system with the technical specification, the robustness, reliability, failure recovery, etc will be assessed.  Then, the DISTRICT Final Prototype Development will be conducted by implementing the specific development made in each one of the two Evaluation sites for the further installation and evaluation of the system. It will also include the refinement require after the First Evaluation of the DISTRICT 1st prototype.  The whole integrated system will be evaluated in each site. It is foreseen that the users from each site will be the main evaluators of the results of the Projects. The final product will be exploited by the consortium partners.",0,0
542,108300,No,Upload. Urban Politics of London Youngsters Analyzed Digitally,"The main aim of the proposed study is to investigate the lived experience of cultural difference among young Londoners (between 12-18 years) of different cultural backgrounds. Internet applications such as the video sharing platform YouTube, the social-networking site Facebook and micro-blog Twitter are taken as entry points to study the juxtaposition of differences in urban, digital representations. I will theorize and produce new empirical knowledge about how digital practices become loci of intercultural encounters. Taking a comparative approach, I focus on the networked belonging of youths from lower-class (often more multicultural) and upper-class (often more homogeneous) London boroughs on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. As digital practices have become a significant part of their life, it is urgent to achieve greater insights in whether their use of Internet applications corroborates pan-European sentiments of failed multiculturalism and ethnic segregation or whether their experiences rather showcase conviviality, cross-cultural exchange and cultural hybridization. Thus far, the ways in which diverse ethnic/gender/religious identities digitally encounter, negotiate and appropriate one another across online/offline spaces have remained understudied. Innovatively bringing new media, gender and postcolonial studies into dialogue; the layered dynamics and user-generated cultural heterogeneity across Internet applications is scrutinized. The proposed study combines large-scale digital methods to study geographically tagged user-generated content, qualitative in-depth interviews with 90 youths and virtual ethnography with 30 young informants.",0,0
606,219928,No,Childhood Leukemia: Overcoming distance between South America and Europe Regions,"Cancer has become an important public health problem worldwide and inequalities in access to malignancies control result in differences in patients’ outcome. Despite the recent improvement of survival rates in childhood leukaemia, there is still a gap in survival between regions, even within well-organized international cooperative groups. Childhood leukaemia care should be addressed from a global point of view, considering not only scientific aspects, the amount of technological and human resources and the current health policies, but also economic, cultural, social, educational and environmental particularities across countries. The aim of CLOSER is to harmonize the levels of care and reduce inequalities in the outcome of childhood leukaemia patients in the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and in European countries. To do that, we will create a framework of collaborative, multidisciplinary research between CELAC and European regions. From a scientific point of view, we seek to boost a constant exchange of the knowledge on the biology and the technological approaches needed for the diagnosis and follow-up of childhood leukaemia between regions, provide additional resources to perform research and develop new simplified methods to assure a fast translation from bench to bedside. From a social and educative point of view, we will empower patients and families in leukaemia care and encourage the participation of civil society by analysing their particular needs, by promoting advocacy tools, launching a platform to exchange initiatives and experiences in patients care, always acting with the highest respect for the individualities of each country and with the objective to contribute to a better quality of life. To make sure that we approach childhood leukaemia care from an integral perspective, we will include as partners researchers, physicians, patients and families, patients’ organizations, policymakers, small and medium-sized enterprises and civil society representatives. CLOSER will allow a more fluent collaboration worldwide to improve childhood leukaemia control and the quality of life of the patients and their caregivers.",0,0
491,60511,No,School Experience in two European Multicultural Societies: A Comparative Study between Belgium and Britain,"Research objectives and content  This project aims to compare the school experience of adolescents from ethnic minorities' in different schools in Brussels and Birmingham. The way educational systems face social and cultural heterogeneity has become an important issue in Western European multicultural societies and poses the questions of their equity as well as their efficiency. The way British and Belgian educational systems deal with multiculturalism thoroughly differs, and the school experience within each context has not been thoroughly and comparatively analysed. To construct our theoretical framework we will use recent theories of ethnicity, sociology of education (educational strategies and school experience theories) and socialisation.  Our main research questions will be: .How can the strategies developed by both educational systems to deal with multiculturalism be characterized? .How do the school strategies affect adolescents' school experience? .How do the characteristics of the different ethnic groups observed influence adolescents' school experience?  After a brief review of both national and local contexts, the main fieldwork will be conducted in two similar multi-ethnic boroughs: one in Brussels and one in Birmingham.  This part will be dedicated to the comprehension of school experience, through individual interviews combined with the method of sociological intervention (Touraine, 1978, Dubet, 1995).  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  This project will provide two principal products: 1. A qualitative comparison of the way two European educational systems deal with multiculturalism; 2. A global and qualitative approach of school socialisation as a 'social experience', analysing the articulation between its different dimensions (norms integration, school career and self- construction).  The harmonisation of European educational systems requires the accumulation of comparative research.  This project will contribute to this task providing information out two important facets of the problem: efficient and democratic educational strategies with respect to social and cultural heterogeneity and the school experience of adolescents from ethnic minorities.

447,226745,No,"Later Life Intimacy: Women’s Unruly Practices, Spaces and Representations","Almost half a century ago, Simone de Beauvoir (1970) denounced what she called the ‘conspiracy of silence’ in public and scholarly debates about women growing older. Little has changed since then. In spite of the expanding number and proportion of older women in the population and the changing cultural norms regarding sexuality, older women are still often overlooked in research, and their sexuality in particular is still a taboo. Older women are supposed to become asexual and when their sexuality is considered, it is  interpreted within a medicalized and phallocentric framework that starts from young adult standards. So far, social sciences and humanities have failed to develop a viable alternative to this line of thinking. The proposed project aims to rectify this significant gap in research and break the silence around older women and sex. A multi-disciplinary team of scholars with expertise in anthropology, social geography, cultural studies and feminist philosophy will collaborate and tackle challenging research questions in order to acquire a fundamentally new, affirmative understanding of women’s later life sexuality. A radical multi-method ethnographic research methodology will be developed, (1) based on long-term participant observation in various settings and (2) with a specific focus on ‘unruly’ sexual strategies of older women across different social categories. By uncovering counter-hegemonic knowledge of older women—knowledge that usually stays under the radar of academic attention—the project has great potential to revolutionize how we look at women, old age, and sex. A shift in thinking is needed because the prevalent conceptualizations are blatantly oppressive for older women. Moreover, the project’s methodological-theoretical design that brings older women’s subversive sexual strategies to the forefront of research has also the potential to open the way for radical changes in feminist theorizations of intersectional power, sexual desire and ageing.",1,0
356,107939,No,Aiding the Neglected: Meta-Analysis of Emotional Maltreatment Prevention and Intervention Programs,"Emotional maltreatment has been called the most elusive and damaging of all types of maltreatment for a child, and represents the core issue and most destructive factor across all types of child abuse and neglect. This characteristic of negative parent-child relationship has recently received scientific attention with acknowledgments that such neglect the most frequent forms of maltreatment experienced by children and adolescents and has detrimental mental health consequences. With attention given to employment of evidence-based programs as programs with proven effectiveness, examining the effectiveness of various programs for emotional maltreatment is of high theoretical and practical importance. Programs that target other forms of child maltreatment have been subject to several meta-analyses. However, the effectiveness of programs for emotional maltreatment has not been examined under the lens of meta-analysis, and are thus still under much debate. Implementation of meta-analysis in this stage of saturated research on the emotional maltreatment is a crucial step in the further understanding of this phenomenon, and will enable concluding imperative theoretical and practical implications. Thus, the objective of the proposed research project is to conduct a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of identification, prevention and intervention programs for emotionally maltreated children. Beyond its practical implications (e.g., pointing to identification and treatment programs that are evidence-based), the proposed research may offer a theoretical contribution, heretofore unapplied, to the understanding of parental practices that have the most crucial impact on the child’s holistic well-being: mental and physical. This study will be conducted in the Berkeley School of Public Health, under the guidance of Prof. Ozer and in collaboration with Prof. Lieberman form UCSF and Prof. Katz from U. of Washington.",0,0
646,199725,No,Digital Hybrid Breast PET/MRI for Enhanced Diagnosis of Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer represents a leading cause of cancer death in women and a major socio-economic issue. With currently available methods, early diagnosis frequently fails. Moreover, beyond mere detection, there is an ever-increasing need for improved non-invasive characterisation of cancer. Targeted therapies require an in-depth analysis of cancer to select and guide appropriate treatment. Both, PET and MRI can provide molecular and functional information that may be of pivotal importance for tailoring therapy. However, current whole-body PET/MRI systems lack the necessary sensitivity and resolution for this task. HYPMED addresses this by engineering an innovative imaging tool. HYPMED will integrate an innovative fully-digital MRI-transparent PET-detector into a novel multi-channel PET-transparent MRI surface coil. The PET-RF insert will allow unprecedented imaging of breast cancer with high-resolution/ultra-high sensitivity PET, combined with high-level structural and functional MRI, and allow minimal-invasive MR- and PET-guided targeted biopsy. Moreover with such PET-RF inserts, every regular clinical MR-system can, upon demand, be turned into a hybrid system. We will evaluate the impact of this technology on breast cancer diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring/assessment of treatment response by a carefully designed clinical study that employs established and novel PET tracers in 250 patients. Imaging data will be correlated with established and novel molecular biomarkers; results will be compared to those obtained from whole-body PET/MRI and PET/CT. A multidisciplinary consortium of clinical scientists, 3 SMEs and an industry partner will pave the way for commercialization of HYPMED products for advanced clinical decision making in cancer patients. Once HYPMED is successful, we will expand this approach to other applications such as prostate cancer or cardiac hybrid imaging, and thus introduce a paradigm shift in the field of PET/MR hybrid imaging as a whole.",0,0
692,63769,No,European conference on personality,"The overall objective of the European Conference on Personality is to bring together personality psychologists from applied and basic fields and to develop efficient research networks among them. In the last decade numerous psychologists throughout Europe have initiated research programs aiming to contribute to the understanding and solution of societal problems that all European states are facing like efficient use and training of workforce, widespread stress reaction in work and home environments, criminality, prevention of physical and psychological illness, immigration, and xenophobia. The study of individual differences (personality variables) is an important facet of this research. Since there is a tendency that personality constructs are increasingly studied outside the field of personality psychology this conference aims at bringing together psychologists from European countries that are involved in personality research. Setting up research networks and enhancing the exchange among researchers in diverse fields of psychological research is the basic aim of the European Conference on Personality.  There will be an interchange between basic and applied researchers. On the one hand, this conference focuses on those aspects of personality that are important to many research programs: the structure and measurement of personality traits, personality change and development, the aetiology of personality traits. On the other hand, researchers in more applied fields will present their approaches and results. This interchange is extremely important mainly for three reasons: First, to yield a high level of expertise in applied research, second, to avoid the costly parallel development of theories and research methods, and finally, to contribute to the development and testing of theories that generalize across fields of application.",0,0
378,4010,No,MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS OF SOLID TUMOURS,"The major goal of the Concerted Action was to use molecular cytogenetics as an approach to develop diagnostic protocols and reagents for a variety of solid tumours. This required the close collaboration of medical doctors, pathologists, cytogeneticists and molecular biologists. A multinational effort is here essential for several reasons, one being the fact that various tumours are relatively rare, so exchange of data and patient material is essential for valuable studies. Research plymerase chain reaction has been carried out using molecular cytogenetics to develop diagnositic protocols and reagents for a variety of solid tumours. In collaborative studies on neuroblastoma (Nb), a constitutional reciprocal translocation {t (1;17) (p36;q12-21)} found in a patient with neuroblastoma was analysed to find out whether the putative Nb tumour suppressor gene, thought to reside at 1p36, was affected by the translocation. Somatic cell hybrids were established and the presence of the derivative chromosomes was ascertained by karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For the characterization of the chromosomal breakpoints, pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and FISH were used in collaborative studies and most available DNA markers around the 1p36 were mapped. A novel approach to the identification of chromosomes has been developed, which is based upon fluorescent in situ identification of human marker chromosomes using flow sorting and Alu element mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chromosome paints were generated to various normal chromosomes including 5, 6, 14, 19, and 22 and shown to be effective in the identification of the appropriate chromosomes. In addition, certain abnormal chromosomes were used to generate region specific paints. As an approach to molecularly define chromosome 12g13-15 aberrations observed in lipoma, myxoid liposarcoma, uterine leiomyoma and pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary gland, a molecular and cytogenetic research programme is being carried out by a multinational research consortium. The first step has been the development of cell lines for each of the 4 tumour types and the cells are being used to define molecularly the chromosome break points. In the proposed research plan the cytogeneticists will first establish, which chromosome regions are consistently involved in genetic aberrations of particular tumour types. The molecular biologists will then define on the molecular level the genetic alterations that have taken place and identify the genes that are affected. On the basis of these data, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic protocols can be set up using new and advanced molecular cytogenetic technology. Part of this technology, as was expected, had to be developed and/or improved in the context of this Concerted Action. The primary aim of the collaborative programme was the typing of solid tumours by molecular cytogenetics; subsequent correlation studies with histopathological and clinical data might then lead to the identification of prognostic determinants. %Through the Concerted Action, it was expected that not only greater numbers of rare solid tumours could be studied but also that they could be studied in greater detail. Information that would not be obtained otherwise would become available to the research and medical community.",0,0
806,227471,No,Microrobotic Gamete/Zygote IntraFallopian Transfer,"Infertility is a worldwide problem affecting ~11% of the reproductive-age population. Severe cases are currently treated by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic injection techniques (ICSI) with high fertilization rates (~95%). However, embryo transfer is still the critical stage with only 32% of the cases resulting in clinical pregnancies. Moreover, the implantation rates per embryo remain very low (~17%) and often the procedure needs to be repeated several times with no success implying a high economic and social cost. Among the different methods used to overcome this issue, gamete or zygote ntrafallopian transfer (GIFT or ZIFT) seems more promising offering appropriate physiological environment for zygote/embryo development at an optimal synchronization between embryonic and endometrial preparation. However, these methods are invasive and involve surgical procedures and anaesthesia to introduce macroscopic imaging and manipulation tools into the female body, increasing the risk of injury and ectopic pregnancies. The goal of Micro-GIFT is to seek for novel approaches to non-invasively transport and release high-quality gametes/zygotes in the fallopian tube in vivo (mice model). For that multifunctional untethered microrobots (~100 µm size) will be developed making use of smart materials and advanced microtechnologies. However, there are major challenges that need to be overcome to bring this technology close to the clinic, such as the in vivo imaging and control of such microrobots, and their removal after use. The project will also provide deeper insights on the contribution of the fallopian tube on the natural embryo development and implantation, being crucial to create more natural procedures with high success rates. The PI has contributed significantly to the field of sperm-based microbots for assisted fertilization and targeted drug delivery as well as developed a variety of novel microbiosensors for molecular and cellular analysis.",0,0

This project is about the development of algorithms for online dynamic social networks, understanding influence processes, and the study of some issues related to security on social network. First we plan to build the algorithmic basis for the problems in the social networks. Our idea concentrates on stating basic combinatorial optimization problems in new settings that are driven by applications to real-time social networks. We plan to study NP-hard problems in a dynamic real-time setting and in the setting where a universal solution has to be stored in limited memory. The study of these problems is motivated by direct applications in social networks such as message broadcasting, clustering, and service localization. The ubiquitous connections through the various social networks put us on a continuous risk. First of all it becomes hard to retain privacy, as collectively these social networks contain sensitive private information. In addition, each social network we are contained in is a new possible threat for our computer system. It might be a source of spam or an entry point of a new virus.

172,193867,No,"European Global Transition Network on Eco-Innovation, Green Economy and Sustainable Development","In the last two decades the world has experienced several crises. In light of these trends and to more effectively move towards sustainable development, several organisations and international actors have developed the concept of green economy as action-oriented approaches. Priority interventions are aimed at triggering technology adoption, and stimulate behavioural change. In fact, eco-innovation can be considered an enabler for a green economy to the same extent that the green economy can be understood as an enabler of sustainable development. Green.eu is designed to address these challenges, ranging the conceptualization of eco-innovation and the green economy, to the harmonization of the approaches needed to coherently assess performance, identify gaps (successes and failures) for the effective adoption of technologies that can create win-win results. In particular, the project is designed so as to improve (1) harmonization of definitions, (2) collection of relevant information on the performance of past and current efforts, and (3) coordination among stakeholders. Green.eu sees the main challenges in an improved understanding (and scientific assessment) of the concepts of green economy and eco-innovation, on the adaptation of policy agendas, the documentation of best practices and guidelines for knowledge transfer and transferability. The inter- and transdisciplinary green.eu network (including knowledge brokers, programme owners and global industry networks) is research based and aims to accelerate the transition towards a green economy significantly, with a European focus on co-development of knowledge.

594,201112,No,The Remote Control of Maternal Metabolism by the Placenta,"During pregnancy many physiological changes occur in the mother that are designed to support fetal growth. These include changes in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune and metabolic systems. In particular, the mother becomes less reactive to insulin, leading to increased glucose availability to the fetus in late pregnancy. These adaptations are thought to be signaled, in part by changes in placental hormone production. Whilst studies have shown that the placenta has the capacity to produce different hormones, their specific role in adapting maternal metabolism during pregnancy relies principally on association studies. Moreover, there are likely to be more protein mediators secreted by the placenta with systemic actions in the mother. Failure to adjust the mother's body to the pregnant state may result in pregnancy complications, including abnormal birth weight and maternal diabetes, which can further lead to a range of medical complications for the mother and baby. The overall goal of this study will be to identify the nature and wider biological significance of placental endocrine function in adapting the mother's body during pregnancy to support fetal growth, with a focus on maternal metabolism. This work will primarily use the mouse as an experimental model as the placental signaling/secreting cells are conveniently organized into a distinct region and are under unique genetic control. Therefore placental signaling cells can be isolated, cultured and genetically-modified independent of other cells in the mouse placenta. The secreted placental candidates will be identified using the latest sequencing technologies, and their metabolic effects will be tested on cell lines and in the whole organism using unique genetic tools available at the University of Cambridge. Knowledge gained from this study will be the first step in the development of targeted interventions for optimizing fetal growth and preventing pregnancy complications.",0,0

477,97680,No,Transfection Ability and Intracellular Pathway of LbL Nanostructured siRNA Delivery Systems,"The scientific objective of the research carried out in this International Research Staff Exchange Scheme, is the development of a new technology to effectively deliver siRNA to cancer cells by the embedding of a polyplex into the multilayers and multifunctional nanocapsules. We propose to target pro-survival and anti-apoptotic factors in human cancer cells by using siRNA encapsulated into polyelectrolytes nanocapsules.When siRNAs are formulated into degradable polymer nanocapsules they may be protected from nuclease digestion and last longer than naked siRNAs improving their efficacy and therapeutical properties. These capsules will be prepared by the LbL deposition of interacting polymers onto a sacrificial porous colloidal template followed by core removal. Nanoengineered micro-nanocapsules composed of sequentially assembled polymer layers hold immense promise for a variety of biomedical applications. Furthermore the optimization of intracellular pathway of nanostructures may likely be a key for the development of effective nanoparticles based targeted therapeutics. As the challenge of siRNA delivery by nanocapsules is met, it will be possible to advance RNAi therapeutics rapidly into clinical studies for many diseases, including some which remain untreatable or poorly treated by conventional drugs.",0,0
730,95265,No,Syllables and the Timing of Speech,"Project summary: The project develops an integrative symbolic-dynamical framework for gaining a fundamental understanding of the relation between qualitative spoken language form, also known as phonological form, and the continuous speech movements and acoustics in which this form is realized. The empirical domain is syllables. The syllable is a central unit of spoken language, mediating between lower-level properties of individual sounds and higher-level prosody. In its first aim, the proposed research develops modelling methods for rigorously evaluating the relation between theoretically posited syllabic parses and experimental data, from Arabic and English, acquired with the new 3D EMA device. In a second aim, formal analytical methods are developed for understanding the relation between posited abstract phonological organization and its measurable phonetic indices. Using a combined symbolic-dynamical approach, the analytical component fully embraces the task of relating continuous data and qualitative theory, a fundamental problem in present day cognitive science. As a consequence, the project enables a system-level, quantitative understanding of how categorical organizational principles of linguistic systems may be supported by or emerge from statistical properties of the lower-levels in which linguistic form is conveyed. The interdisciplinary theoretical, experimental and mathematical approach proposed here has not been attempted before for spoken language. The outcome would be a unified explanatory framework for linguistic competence, experimental data and statistics. The project’s significance and relevance to the “Ideas” program lies in the centrality of the core problem it addresses for the language and mind frontier. In linguistics and cognitive science, a fundamental challenge has been the lack of a formal substrate for dealing with the duality of the symbolic and the continuous. The development of an integrative framework for exploring the relation between qualitative phonological form and continuous data will open up new perspectives for researching both language and the human mind. In addition, the proposed research has significant potential long-term benefits for language development, impairment and reading. Because syllabic organization is language-specific and because we know that this organization conditions the timing of articulatory movements, syllables provide a key construct for studying the link between articulatory timing and linguistic ability in both healthy and patient populations.",0,0
171,227898,No,Resource wars in an unequal world: international law and beyond,"The growing demand for resource commodities, coupled with the climate crisis, have increased pressures on ecosystems and individuals who are already at the margins of society. Conflicts over natural resources and the environment are considered among the greatest challenges of the 21st-century. While the link between resource scarcity or wealth and armed violence is increasingly discussed by political scientists, there is still little understanding of how international law operates in this venue of global governance, where power imbalances shape relations among different actors (transnational corporations, governments, international institutions, and peoples). By conducting two case-studies, which focus on the problem of ‘conflict resources’ and the security impacts of climate change, this project will illuminate international law’s role in framing these types of conflicts and finding ways to tackle them, and the place of different actors within legal discourses. It will demonstrate how distributive concerns may be sidelined and inequalities perpetuated through legal/institutional arrangements. This project will open intellectual spaces to rethink common ‘solutions’ to the international legal order’s most pressing concerns: the ecological crisis, rising civil wars, and their interaction. It will initiate a more inclusive and much-needed debate about alternative understandings of international peace and security, which reflect the lived-experiences of peoples in the Global South. Through the integration of other disciplines into the study and critique of international law, this project presents the opportunity to open a new field of knowledge, which will spark the interest of different constituencies (e.g. legal, political, IR scholars), and aligns with the interdisciplinary character of research at the HO.",0,0
3,99033,Yes,STRATIFIED FAMILY DYNAMICS: POLARIZING TRENDS IN COUPLE BEHAVIOUR AND PARENTING,"The project applies a multiple equilibrium framework to understand ongoing transformations in family demography and their consequences for social inequalities. Associated with the changing economic role of women emerge novel family forms that replace the conventional male breadwinner model. The transition is very much in flux, producing multiple equilibria some of which are unstable and associated with inefficient and inequitable couple specialization. Based on long micro panel data for four countries at different stages of the transition, the study will address three parallel issues. One, identifying equilibrium shifts from the traditional towards more gender symmetric family forms, with particular focus on the endogenously driven dynamics that drive populations towards a gender egalitarian equilibrium. Two, analyzing the potentially polarizing demographic correlates of changing family behaviour in particular in terms of marital choice and couple stability. Three, testing hypotheses regarding family polarization with respect to parental investments in children and how these, in turn, influence children’s life chances.",0,1
897,78456,No,Structural hinders to and promoters of good maternal care in rural China,"China has experienced a wide range of social and economic reforms during the last twenty years with unprecedented speed and scale. Although this has implied a rapid economic growth, it has also created new challenges for the world's most populous nation. O ne of these challenges is disparity in maternal health between geographical regions, as well as between rural and urban populations. In the poorest areas, around 50 per cent of women do not receive antenatal care, 90 per cent of women deliver at home and only one third of home births are assisted by trained midwives. This study aims to search and test appropriate interventions to alleviate financial access to and quality of maternal care in the specific context of rural China and thus provide policymakers and managers with tools for effective actions for the improvement of maternal and infant health status of the rural poor. This research project focuses on maternal health system and women of reproductive age in rural areas of China. It provides a comprehen sive analysis of the current state of affairs, provider and user perspectives, of maternal care at national and local level using both national and local surveys as well as locally collected in-depth qualitative data. The synthesised understanding of the c urrent situation provides basis of innovative intervention models carefully drafted to fit the Chinese context. The trial of these interventions results in policy recommendations developed in close collaboration with experts from key player groups who part icipate directly in all phases of the project. Chinese health sector reform and its implications to health financing have been studied and published extensively.

The underlying hypotheses are :  * Hypothesis A : When refugees are integrated in the host population they fare better than if they are separated from the host population and confined to camps.  * Hypothesis B : The health services of the host country can play an important role in the reception of refugees; in the process of doing so, these services are strengthened.  * Hypothesis C : An integrated approach to health service delivery for refugees is more cost-effective than organising parallel refugee health services.  1.3. The research work will be organised around 3 research questions :  * Question 1 : What are the effects of different approaches to refugee reception on the health status of the refugees? What is the role of the health services of the host countries? What are their costs? Under which conditions are they adequate or inadequate?  * Question 2 : Why are refugees now most often concentrated in camps, with parallel health services organised for them? and why they are sometimes allowed to settle freely and use the health services of the host country?  * Question 3 : Is it possible to influence the process which leads to the separation of refugees from the host population and the organisation of parallel health services of refugees? Expected Outcome  * A better understanding of effects of different settlement patterns on refugees, of determinants and actors in refugee situations * Empowerment of local actors (government, national academic institutions) * Strengthened research and training capability in the field of refugee health care for the partners involved * More diverse and locally appropriate settlement and assistance policies. * Intensive training period at the Refugee Studies Programme in Oxford for the researchers involved   * Extensive literature study on Refugee Health Care  * Resource mapping : gathering of existing data on the different refugee-affected areas in Kenya (Kakuma, Dadaab,...) and Uganda (Arua, Moyo, Kitgum, Masidi,...)  * Workshops and field conferences involving all academic and operational partners (Government institutions, UN agencies, NGOs, etc.)  * Specific data-collections on health status of refugees in different settings; including surveys to determine welfare-status and level of uprootedness  * Examine if policy changes are possible through in-depth discussions, interviews, focus group discussions",0,0
800,222851,No,Spatial and demographic dynamics of disease transfer at the wildlife-human interface,"Infectious diseases present a significant and growing threat to public health, domestic livestock production, and biodiversity conservation. Due to their global distribution and wide-ranging movements, seabirds are important vectors for the spread of pathogens across continents and ocean basins. Coastal seabirds, which associate with and exploit anthropogenic food sources, are particularly likely to interact with human-associated pathogens and zoonotic agents, making them useful candidates for monitoring disease prevalence. However, many factors mediating the interactions between seabirds and pathogens remain unknown or poorly understood.   Our study will combine targeted field data collection, laboratory analysis, and quantitative modeling to develop a mechanistic understanding of the factors affecting prevalence and transmission of infectious diseases by seabirds at the wildlife-human interface. We will explore spatial and demographic factors affecting exposure and transmission rates for two key zoonotic diseases, toxoplasmosis and avian influenza, by a generalist coastal seabird, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) in the western Mediterranean basin. Within this study system, we will combine movement analysis using biologging, serological sampling, habitat and demographic analysis, and agent-based models to develop a comprehensive understanding of epidemiological dynamics. We will also use experimental studies to directly test the development of disease immunity in nestling birds and the effects of management actions on disease transfer. We will then apply scenario planning to study the effects of both management and habitat change on disease dynamics. Our results will not only improve understanding of gulls as vectors for infectious agents, but also provide a comprehensive quantitative framework for modeling disease dynamics that can be adapted to predicting and managing the spread of infectious disease at the wildlife-human interface.",0,0

597,104752,No,Talent and Extended Mobility in the European Innovation Union,"Mobility represents a key factor at the early stages of researchers’ careers. Over the last years the European Union has started a number of initiatives to facilitate mobility in the European Research Area, most prominently the EURAXESS Services Network. The TANDEM proposal aims at strengthening these activities by adding a complimentary focus on dual career aspects. In growing numbers young researchers are on the move as dual career couples. Therefore universities and research institutions are challenged to accommodate the needs and ambitions of dual career couples if they want to attract the most talented young researchers. Thus the attractiveness of universities and research institutions is no longer defined just by an excellent research environment, but by additional practical integration factors and most of all career prospects for both partners. TANDEM will analyze the basic requirements for the successful implementation of Dual Career and Integration Services (DCIS) and develop a systematic and modular approach to these services which will allow universities and research institutions in the ERA to put together a customized set of DCIS according to their specific needs, goals, social and cultural border conditions. Besides, TANDEM will focus on brain circulation and how DCIS change a brain drain into a brain gain situation. While it is true that both men and women are affected by mobility, it is acknowledged that it is more difficult for women to successfully pursue a scientific career when they have to reconcile work and home responsibilities. By implementing well structured DCIS it will be possible to prevent young women researchers from abandoning a promising scientific career just because they are faced with insurmountable obstacles. Thus TANDEM will contribute to a more gender-balanced and diverse scientific workforce in Europe and thereby promote the goals of the European Innovation Union for the social and economic benefit of the European Society.",0,0

Any devised solution to be operationalized through the GEPs should take into account contextual features to reach effectiveness, and that innovative measures or initiatives designed by SUPERA should be brought to the knowledge of relevant stakeholders to feed their own expertise regarding SUPERA’s key areas. Partners within SUPERA’s consortium reflect the ambition of this project: maintaining a dual approach, RPOs are characterized by their size and impact potential, and their multidisciplinarity and vast academic offer (UCM, UNICA, CEU, UC-CES), while RFOs (MINECO, RAS) from the same partner countries as UCM and UNICA, respectively, are integral in maximising outreach and comitment as relevant public entities on a national level. This fact, while adding a complexity layer to GEP implementation, expands the scope of the project and the potential long-term impacts regarding sustainability and institutionalisation.

These guidelines are to be developed after research of the quality of care in the participating hospitals within their respective health care systems  Brief description: The terms ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease designate a group of inflammatory diseases of the large and small intestine. The term 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease.' is often used to delineate these two chronic diseases of unknown origin. The first signs often develop at an early age; early recognition, good management, and continuity of care may have important consequences for the quality of the individual's life. Organization of health care (health care structure, accessibility of health-care, treatment policy, health care insurance, financial aspects etc.) diverge widely among different European countries. Since these differences may affect the patients well-being, IBD needs a multidisciplinary approach by physicians, gastroenterologists, surgeons, dieticians, psychologists, social workers and so further. It is of major importance to provide a better insight into the structural differences in health care systems between the European countries and to relate these differences to the possible effects on quality of life of IBD This study is carried out as a concerted action with a considerable number of European centers continuing the co-operation which has been created by the previous concerted action, the EC-IBD project. Important aims of this study are: to encourage a close cooperation between three regions in Europe; to measure and describe quality of care in IBD-patients, to create guidelines and protocols for monitoring good quality of care in this patient group, and to stimulate further research and international co-operation concerning quality of care in order to enhance quality of life for these patients. The study will consist of two parts: a retrospective part and a prospective part. Relevant variables are: measure of recurrence, relapse, remission, hospital admissions, extra-intestinal bowel complications, surgical interventions, disease activity, accessibility of health care, financial aspects, type of insurance, social support from relatives and friends. The main outcomes of the study will be: a guideline/protocol for monitoring quality of life, the description of a health care system which might be used on an European level. Standardization of the measurement of quality of care will make it possible to investigate the influence of multiple variables on quality of life between countries and, within countries, between types of hospitals. This kind of outcomes can only be achieved in an international scientific concerted action.

565,96256,No,Role of the Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant response system in thyroid gland homeostasis and thyroid cancer,"Recently, it has been discovered that the thyroid gland has increased ability to withstand oxidative stress compared to other organs. This important feature allows the gland to maintain its homeostasis in the face of increased burden of free radicals produced during iodine metabolism for thyroid hormone synthesis. Iodine deficiency and goiter are associated with increased oxidative stress in the thyroid. While some antioxidant enzymes are known to be upregulated in the thyroid under such conditions, the broader regulatory mechanisms of oxidative stress resistance remain unknown. The proposed research aims to investigate the role of the major antioxidant response system orchestrated by the transcription factor Nrf2 in thyroid gland homeostasis and thyroid cancer. Specifically, it will examine whether Nrf2 regulates the thyroid’s antioxidant defenses; whether Nrf2 activity in the thyroid is altered during iodine deficiency and goitrogenesis; and whether constitutive Nrf2 activation by somatic mutations is associated with thyroid cancer. These investigations will utilize mouse knockouts of Nrf2 and wild-type animals, primary thyroid cell cultures derived from these mice, and archived thyroid cancer samples from human subjects. This work has implications for the management of iodine deficiency and the prevention of thyroid carcinogenesis. This interdisciplinary research project will be executed by Dr. Gerasimos Sykiotis, a translational investigator who has prior research experience in thyroid gland pathophysiology and has acquired state-of-the-art expertise with the Nrf2 antioxidant response system in the country of origin (USA). The University of Patras Medical Center is a highly qualified host organization as it has in place both the nrf2-/- animals and the human thyroid cancer samples.

30,221811,Yes,Study on TRansition and Exclusion in Society of Single-Mums,"Lone motherhood is considered as an increasing social problem, not only because its increase but also since it leads to diverse and separated women having only a partial citizenship. There is little knowledge on the social relations and practices that contribute – or do not contribute – to protecting and socially including lone mothers, beginning from the crucial transition to lone parenthood: the judicial evaluation. Focusing on the transition from double parenthood to lone motherhood and, in particular, on the period of judicial evaluation for child custody and judicial decisions for children/family allowances and divorce/separation, this project aims to investigate some specific aspects of the socio-cultural construction of an active gender citizenship by future lone mothers. The interest is in lone mothers’ everyday strategies and social practices to claim inclusion and to negotiate (or not negotiate) the dominant definition of family and parenthood proposed by institutions and professionals, and the less legitimated and multiple situated definitions of lone parents  and their families. Introducing the everyday dimension into the study of gender citizenship has the purpose of exploring the lone mothers’ manifest and hidden ‘work’ of legitimation and of possible de-legitimation by institutions. Adopting the sociological approach of Institutional Ethnography (IE) as a method, this study will collect data in three EU countries (Belgium, Italy and Spain) and in the UK, with discursive interviews to lone mothers, professionals and gender issues activists, participant observations, and photo-voice. The action includes an extensive training in life course studies and gender studies, advanced qualitative methods and academic English language.

48,97112,Yes,Understanding and Supporting Families with Complex Needs,"Understanding and supporting families with multiple and complex needs is an area of policy and practice that is gaining importance and emphasis across the European Union and beyond. This growing policy interest is mirrored by emergent theoretical and empirical research in various countries. Despite this interest, a recent international research review of approaches to supporting families with complex needs, carried out by Morris, Hughes, Clarke and colleagues (2008) at the University of Birmingham, illustrates a stark paucity of academic analyses of policy and practice concerned specifically with ‘family’ in relation to a number of service user groups and marginalised communities. That which exists appears fragmented, with little coherency to the international knowledge base regarding current approaches, effective practice or appropriate research methodologies. This proposal therefore seeks to exploit existing and potential links between divergent disciplines and knowledge streams, both nationally and internationally, to enhance understandings of family-focused approaches across domains of social care, education, and health. It will explore theoretical frameworks, models and approaches dominant in particular practice settings, and their impact in responding to specific needs of families in each partner country. It will also explore the challenges, tensions and contradictions in implementing family-focused policies and practices, and the implications for professional knowledge and frameworks, and associated training. Drawing on the varying expertise of each partner, it will test strategies to address the challenges in the design of family-centred evaluation and research able to effectively capture the experiences for whole families, as families as well as individuals. In doing so, it will develop a network of universities with expertise in family-related research and form the basis for a much wider network, able to utilise and contribute to our analyses.",0,1
649,212297,No,Supergene evolution in a classic plant system - bringing the study of distyly into the genomic era,"Understanding how adaptive combinations of traits are maintained is a central question in evolutionary biology. Supergenes are clusters of genes that can maintain favorable trait combinations because they are inherited as a unit. Studying supergenes allows us to address fundamental questions on the origin and evolution of complex adaptations and the effects of suppressed recombination, and is therefore of broad significance.  Distylous plants offer a particularly promising opportunity to study supergene evolution. In distylous plants there are two floral morphs that differ reciprocally in the placement of stigma and anthers. These character combinations are maintained by a supergene, the distyly S-locus. While distyly has interested many generations of biologists, we still know little about the origin and evolution of this supergene, and progress on this front has been hampered by the lack of molecular genetic data on the S-locus.  Here, we aim to make full use of the latest advances in genome sequencing technology to bring the study of distyly into the genomic era. Specifically, we will develop the classic Linum genus as a model for supergene evolution. We will first combine de novo assembly of the genomes of six Linum species with genetic studies to identify S-linked regions. Then, we will test whether the S-locus exhibits similarities to sex chromosomes with respect to recombination suppression, genetic degeneration and gene expression evolution. Finally, we will investigate the genetic causes and population genetic consequences of recurrent loss of distyly in Linum.   The high-quality genome assemblies produced during this project will pave the way for future studies of the molecular basis of adaptive floral differences first identified by Darwin. The results from this project are of great general importance for our understanding of the evolution of coadapted gene complexes and will shed new light on the important and fascinating phenomenon of supergenes.",0,0
724,213770,No,Enhancing Capabilities? Rethinking Work-life Policies and their Impact from a New Perspective,"We have witnessed significant work-life policy advancements designed to help men and women more equally combine employment with other spheres of life in recent decades, yet gender inequality persists. Improving gender equality in work-life balance is therefore high on policy agendas throughout Europe. Decades of research in this area have produced key insights but work-family theories fail to sufficiently explain the tenacity of this inequality. Earlier applications of a capabilities approach to work-life balance offer promising inroads, yet the importance of community remains absent. The CAPABLE project will generate fundamentally new knowledge on how work-life balance policies impact an individual’s capability to achieve this balance in Europe by incorporating the understudied dimension of community.    Capabilities reflect what individuals are effectively able to achieve. CAPABLE asks: To what extent do work-life balance policies enhance men and women’s capabilities to achieve work-life balance? To answer this question, we will develop and apply complex models derived from Sen’s capability approach to analyse: 1. the availability, accessibility and design of work-family policies; 2. what these policies mean for men and women’s capabilities to achieve work-life balance based on their embeddedness in individual, community and social contexts; 3. whether work-life policies enhance individual wellbeing; and 4. what policy tools are needed for developing sustainable work-life balance policies that enhance gender equal work-life capabilities. CAPABLE will progress scientific and policy frontiers using innovative, mixed-methods approaches at multiple policy levels. The conceptual clarity and empirical advancements provided will significantly expand our understanding of work-life policies in relation to individual capabilities. Furthermore, it will produce key insights into how sustainable work-life policies addressing gender inequality in work-life can be developed.",1,0

952,3927,No,Distributive effects of cost containment in health care,"The project's aim was to generate evidence on the comparative performance - in terms of equity - of different health care financing and delivery systems.  The Concerted Action on distributive aspects of health care policies has studied equity in health care. Participants critically analysed various indicators used to measure inequality in health, with the following minimal requirements in mind: that the indicator reflects the socioeconomic dimension of inequalities in health; that it reflects the experiences of the entire population; that it be sensitive to changes in the distribution of the population across the socioeconomic groups. Of the indicators examined, only 2 were found to meet all 3 criteria: the slope index of equality (slope of the regression line showing the relationship between a class's health status and its relative rank in the socioeconomic distribution); the concentration index (calculated from the plot showing the cumulative proportions of the population versus the cumulative proportions of health). Another study appraised methods for measuring income based horizontal inequity in health care delivery are with respect to persons in equal need. None of the methods currently used was deemed very well equipped to provide unbiased estimates of the extent of inequity. A third problem examined was the equity efficiency trade off in health resource allocation. A concept oftern used in this context is the QALY, or quality adjusted life year. A policy objective underlying much QALY literature is maximisation of community health, measured as a sum of QALYs. This approach is criticised for taking into account only resource allocation concerns and thus ignoring equity issues. A QALY based social welfare function was proposed as a means of incorporating both types of concern into resource allocation decisions. Until recently, the few cross-country comparisons of health care finance that had been undertaken focused primarily on issues such as cost containment. As a result, comparatively little was known about the equity characteristics of alternative health care financing and delivery systems, and about the likely equity implications of reforms to these systems. This Concerted Action (CA) went some way towards filling this gap by investigating the equity characteristics of 10 health care systems.   Besides its focus on equity, three other features of the project distinguish it from previous cross-country comparisons. One is that, in contrast to previous empirical studies of a comparative nature, which have almost all been based on aggregate data, the present study employs micro-level data. A second feature of the present study is that those participating have together developed and then applied a common methodology. There is, as a result, a high degree of comparability in the empirical results. Differences in results ought therefore to reflect genuine differences between countries rather than differences in methods. A third feature of the project is that the analysis for each of the 10 countries has been undertaken, for the most part, by research teams from the country in question. This contrasts with previous comparative studies in the health field where one or two researchers have invariably performed the analysis for all the countries in the study.",0,0
407,103471,No,Evolution of longevity and senescence in long-lived Asian elephants and humans,"Ageing is a central concept in biology and has implications for humanities, social sciences and public health. A few mammals with extreme longevity, including human women, represent a striking exception to general pattern, ceasing reproduction at age 50 and having a long post-reproductive lifespan, thus posing the question of whether and why long post-reproductive lifespan in such species has been under natural selection. I am applying to establish a new innovative project to investigate the evolution of extreme longevity in mammals, by combining my previous extensive expertise on longevity and senescence in humans with data on an another long-lived mammal with similar life-history, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Asian elephants have long lifespan (maximum of 80 years), live in social groups containing many generations and thus would make a fascinating comparison to humans and the patterns of longevity evolution in animals in general. My proposed approach is novel, the dataset used unique, and the results are likely to be highly interesting both across different disciplines of science as well as to the public. I am applying to conduct this study at the top-biological science Dept. in UK (as ranked in national survey 2009 based on the quality of research), Animal and Plant Sciences (APS) of the University of Sheffield. Working in Sheffield would allow me: to test my previous findings on humans with new avenues on elephants thus widening my personal research spectrum; continue working on topics and systems that attract lots of media interest in the positive sense; enable further international funding opportunities from inter-disciplinary sources; likely lead to high-impact publications; highly interest students both at the undergraduate and postgraduate level.

However, patients with blindness following cortical damage may retain visual functions, despite visual awareness is lacking (blindsight). But, how can we translate non-conscious visual abilities into conscious ones after damage to the visual cortex? To place our understanding of visual awareness on firm neurobiological and mechanistic bases, I propose to integrate human and monkey neuroscience. Next, I will translate this wisdom into evidence-based clinical intervention. First, LIGHTUP will apply computational neuroimaging methods at the micro-scale level, estimating population receptive fields in humans and monkeys. This will enable analyzing fMRI signal similar to the way tuning properties are studied in neurophysiology, and to clarify how brain areas translate visual properties into responses associated with awareness. Second, LIGHTUP leverages a behavioural paradigm that can dissociate nonconscious visual abilities from awareness in monkeys, thus offering a refined animal model of visual awareness. Applying behavioural-Dynamic Causal Modelling to combine fMRI and behavioral data, LIGHTUP will build up a Bayesian framework that specifies the directionality of information flow in the interactions across distant brain areas, and their causal role in generating visual awareness. In the third part, I will devise a rehabilitation protocol that combines brain stimulation and visual training to promote the (re)emergence of lost visual awareness. LIGHTUP will exploit non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a novel protocol that enables stimulation of complex cortical circuits and selection of the direction of connectivity that is enhanced. This associative stimulation has been proven to induce Hebbian plasticity, and we have piloted its effects in fostering visual awareness in association with visual restoration training.",0,0
763,13296,No,IMPROVEMENT OF PRACTICAL COUNTERMEASURES : PREVENTIVE MEDICATION,"The Chernobyl experience demonstrated that the time interval between an atomic accident and the arrival of the radioactivity in a country can be short enough to be an obstacle to preventive medication of the population.   The present study describes the effects of administering to human subjects a dose of 100 mg of potasium iodide six hours after the ingestion of a dose of iodine 131. Subjects were selected from the normal population of patients referred to our Unit for thyroid scintigraphy. Euthyroid state was assessed on the basis of radioimmunological assay of thyroid circulating hormones (free tetraiodothyronine (T4), free triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)). The treatment (potassium iodide or a placebo) was administered 6 hours after the iodine 131 dose, and immediately after the acquisition of the thyroid scintigraphy.",0,0
944,97705,No,Missed Opportunities in Maternal and Infant Health: reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity in the year after childbirth through combined facility- and community-based interventions,"Improving maternal and newborn health requires innovative approaches that maximise opportunities for impact throughout the continuum of care. In the past decade, maternal health services have largely focused on the management of intrapartum complications and on rationalising the package of antenatal services to include emergency obstetric care provided by skilled birth attendants. These interventions have sought to target what are widely considered to be the most common and immediate causes of maternal death. Yet this approach fails to address many underlying morbidities that are instrumental in generating high rates of maternal mortality, such as anaemia and inadequate birth spacing. Also missing is a direct focus on the substantial proportion of maternal deaths in the postpartum. Indeed, as a component of maternal health, postpartum care has been neglected, along with the field of newborn health in Africa. The essential package and optimum structure of postpartum services for women and newborns in Africa remains poorly defined, with missed opportunities for improved care. We thus propose developing a package of interventions targeting newborn health and women in the early postpartum period and throughout the first year after childbirth. This package will be delivered through a combined facility- and community-based approach designed to integrate services and strengthen health systems. It will be implemented in four African countries (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi and Mozambique) by a consortium of five African and three European partners. Intervention design will be preceded and informed by a situational analysis of postpartum policies and practices in the four countries and a feasibility assessment. This will ensure that interventions are amenable to scaling up and appropriately tailored to local contexts. Implementation will be followed by health systems research to evaluate effectiveness and impact, and to identify determinants of healthcare improvements.",1,0
667,44919,No,Biochemical and crystallographic studies on u2snrnp of the pre-mrna splicingmachinery,"Research objectives and content  Gene expression is regulated through transcriptional control, RNA processing, transport and localization rf RNA and translational control. A central element in this control system is the pre-mRNA splicing reaction mediated by a large RNA-protein complex called spliceosome.  The aim of my PhD project will be to gain a more detailed insight into the structural organisation of snRNPs in order to understand the catalytic mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing at a molecular level. The project will be focused on U2 snRNP which is involved in branch site recognition. I will reassemble the U2 12S snRNP particle and parts thereof from overexpressed protein subunits and different RNA constructs for the biochemical characterisation and crystallographic analyses. The project is concerned with specific protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions within snRNPs, about how snRNPs achieve specific recognition of short RNA sequences within pre-mRNA and about interactions within snRNPs upon assembly into the entire spliceosome. Besides the information about this important biological process, general ideas about protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction are expected to evolve.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The project offers a wide variety of different techniques ranging from molecular biolgy and protein biochemistry to structure determination, especially a profound training in xray crystallography. It also provides a deep theoretical knowledge about protein and RNA structures.",0,0
213,219579,No,DIGITal ENcyclopedia of European Sociability,"The Digital Encyclopaedia of European Sociability (DIGITENS) project will produce the first open-access digital encyclopaedia and anthology of sociability in Europe throughout the long-eighteenth century. The purpose of the DIGITENS project is to build an original framework for understanding the interactions, tensions, limits and paradoxes underlying European models of sociability and to reflect on the following question: Can the emergence and formation of European models of sociability be traced throughout the long eighteenth century (1650-1850)? Drawing upon the expertise of international members from different disciplines and national traditions, the project will create a toplevel interdisciplinary network and facilitate intersectoral communication between its academic and non-academic partners. The eight international universities will work together with the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Musée Cognacq-Jay in France, and The National Archives in Great Britain, allowing members to explore how understandings of sociability might be enhanced through dialogue, international collaboration, and digital technology, developing a broader contextualisation of the research into European sociability. As the first digital encyclopaedia of its kind, the expected impact of the resource will not only benefit researchers, but anyone interested in the history of European models of sociability.  The project is not, however, of purely historical or academic interest. Through the implementation of outreach events, workshops and the production of the accessible digital platforms, the DIGITENS team will promote a wide investigation of the value of eighteenth century principles in twenty-first-century private and public lives throughout Europe. The interdisciplinary and international aspects of the DIGITENS project, and coherent methodology, are innovative, and the scope broad and ambitious.",0,0
727,227174,No,Narratives of Loss: Unravelling the Origins of Support for Socially Conservative Political Agendas,"The key aim of the LOSS project is to unravel: How economic hardship affects support for socially conservative political agendas aimed at restricting the rights of marginalised groups (ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities, migrants, LGBTQIA\ and women), and how local and national policy contexts affect this relationship. Many European societies have recently experienced growing prejudice towards marginalised groups and the rise in support for far-right parties advocating to restrict the rights of these groups. These developments threaten the cohesion of national and local communities across Europe. While aggregate level evidence suggests that financial crises generally coincide with increased support for far-right parties, we do not understand why this happens. By developing a groundbreaking interdisciplinary theoretical framework that integrates insights about the role of loss from political science, sociology, social psychology and behavioural economics, the LOSS project contends that experiences of economic hardship translate into specific narratives of loss that in turn trigger support for social conservative political agendas. To empirically examine the importance of narratives of loss, the LOSS project employs an innovative multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. To uncover the role of context, the project compares five European countries (Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) that vary in the level of compensation provided for economic hardship, and local contexts within these countries.",0,0
674,218578,No,The Politics of Marine Biodiversity Data: Global and National Policies and Practices of Monitoring the Oceans,"In order to protect marine biodiversity and ensure that benefits are equally shared, the UN General Assembly has decided to develop a new legally binding treaty under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Marine biodiversity data will play a central role: Firstly, in supporting intergovernmental efforts to identify, protect and monitor marine biodiversity. Secondly, in informing governments interested in particular aspects of marine biodiversity, including its economic use and its contribution to biosecurity. In examining how this data are represented and used, this project will create a novel understanding of the materiality of science-policy interrelations and identify new forms of power in global environmental politics as well as develop the methodologies to do so. This is crucial, because the capacities to develop and use data infrastructures are unequally distributed among countries and global initiatives for data sharing are significantly challenged by conflicting perceptions of who benefits from marine biodiversity research. Despite broad recognition of these challenges within natural science communities the political aspects of marine biodiversity data remain understudied. Academic debates tend to neglect the role of international politics in legitimising and authorising scientific concepts, data sources and criteria and how this influences national monitoring priorities. The central objective of MARIPOLDATA is to overcome these shortcomings by developing and applying a new multiscale methodology for grounding the analysis of science-policy interrelations in empirical research. An interdisciplinary team, led by the PI, will collect and analyse data across different policy-levels and spatial scales by combining 1) ethnographic studies at intergovernmental negotiation sites with 2) a comparative analysis of national biodiversity monitoring policies and practices and 3) bibliometric and social network analyses and oral history interviews for mapping marine biodiversity science.",0,0
102,83466,Yes,Mentoring for the transfer of good practice in supporting women entrepreneurs for European Research participation,"Women are active in research and development however their participation level in European research projects and trans-national co-operation is low - this if even more true for women owned businesses. Part of the problem is that women entrepreneurs are not reached by the mainstream information and support schemes for EU RTD.  The running ETI WomEn2FP6 uses specific schemes of awareness raising and training to motivate the participation of women entrepreneurs and facilitates partnering with FP 6 coordinators. The WomEn2FP6 coordinators have been asked for support by women entrepreneurs and business support organisations from regions not participating in the project. The concept for transferring the experience of WomEn2FP6 to other regions has been born out of this need.  WE-Mentor is twinning 4 senior regions as mentors with 4 less developed regions on women entrepreneur support issues. The mentee regions are 2 candidate countries (Romania and Turkey), one associated (Israel) and one- third country (India). Mentor s will act in pairs to analyse the existing mentees' infrastructures and environments to develop an implementation plan for training and support. The Mentee regions will be trained on good practices how to approach, motivate and facilitate women entrepreneur participation in EU RTD.  In a second step the mentees will implement the good practices in their regions and start a set of activities to promote women participation in EU RTD. Mentors will support the implementation process and involve role models from their own regions. The database of women entrepreneurs, developed under WomEn2FP6, will be used to insert cooperation profiles from the Mentor and Mentee regions. Matching of profiles for transnational partnership building will be performed; coordinators of FP6 and FP7 projects encouraged using the database to include SMEs lead by women into their projects.",0,1
225,98239,No,Mechanisms of CENP-A Assembly and Propagation at Fission Yeast Centromeres,"Centromeres are vital structures on eukaryotic chromosomes that are essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Centromeric DNA is bound by a centromere-speciﬁc variant of histone H3 known as CENP-A that replaces canonical H3 in centromeric chromatin, thus specifying centromere identity. The regulation of CENP-A chromatin assembly, however, remains poorly understood. Here, I propose experiments directed towards understanding how CENP-A chromatin is established and faithfully propagated in the ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  In Aim 1, I will adopt biochemical and genetic approaches to identify novel factors that contribute to CENP-A chromatin integrity. I expect to discover proteins that could inﬂuence CENP-A chromatin at several levels, including CENP-A assembly factors & chaperones, chromatin remodelling and histone modifying enzymes. In Aim 2, I propose to systematically characterise the novel factors identiﬁed from Aim 1, in order to assess their exact functions at centromeres. I will also perform experiments that will allow me to classify them into two distinct groups: CENP-A incorporation speciﬁc and CENP-A propagation speciﬁc factors. In Aim 3, I will devise a specialised approach to investigate the features of CENP-A that confer it the unique ability to serve as an epigenetic mark that maintains centromere position and identity.  Through the state-of-the-art approaches I propose in this application, I expect to uncover the complex mechanisms that define centromeric chromatin integrity. This research will elevate Europe's reputation in epigenetics and chromatin research, and thus enhance European excellence in the life sciences.",0,0
50,92158,Yes,Discrimination Norms Enforced and Disrupted by Social Networks: A Research Program Using Simulation and Experiments,"Recognizable traits (gender, ethnicity, hair color) often provide a basis for negative discrimination, even if there is no statistical basis for differentiation. Still, people act differently towards persons with different traits, as if they had different qualities, for instance with regard to work efficiency. This leads to severe conflicts if discrimination provokes prejudice and stigmatizing that in practice mostly target asymmetrically members of one, disadvantaged category. The proposed research program enriches existing theories about the emergence and maintenance of discrimination by a new perspective: it aims to model mechanisms based on social network relations and incorporates them into the explanations. It tries to find answers under which structural configurations discrimination practices are likely to occur and under which network conditions they can be best avoided. For answering these questions, innovative methodologies will be used: agent-based simulation and experiments. These techniques have only been used to a limited extent targeting the problem of discrimination, but offer a huge potential to extend our limited insight into social mechanisms that maintain discrimination practices. With the help of these methods, the proposed research tries to delineate conditions under which an endogenous breakdown of negative discrimination is promoted by social networks. Particular attention will be devoted to cases of fierce intergroup opposition, in which network segregation is aligned with negative discrimination. Results are expected to help forming efficient policies for fighting discrimination and segregation. The practical objectives of the application are to further develop the skills of the applicant in applying these methods with a help of leading experts, and to embed the research program in a multi-disciplinary environment, where important contributions can be expected from sociologists, economists, computer scientists, and historians.",0,1
415,108359,No,Degradation or Empowerment? Challenging Stereotypes About Women in Porn,"This project aims to analyse the relation between women and (audio-visual) pornography. Since its emergence into the public sphere as a “legitimate” (i.e. not illegal) cultural form during the 1970s, pornography has alternatively been regarded as demeaning and harmful or, on the contrary, as empowering and liberating for women – at a symbolic as well as material level. On one hand, feminist anti-porn campaigns – such as those led by C. MacKinnon and A. Dworkin during the 1980s – stated the existence of a destructive illocutory power of porn representations on women’s life; on the other, feminist pro-porn theorists, as well as porn performers and directors have hailed the appearance of pornography within more public space as a means to the accomplishment of women’s sexual consciousness and freedom. These two positions share an essentialist approach to pornography, which is often considered as devoid of generic/stylistic specificities or historical/geographical developments, as well as a similar attitude towards the audience, whose capability to engage in “active reading” practices is nearly underestimated. My research project intends to test the taken-for-granted concepts of degradation and empowerment and their place in discussions of women in contemporary pornography. First of all, I will investigate the discursive strategies through which pornographic texts are organized and attempt to produce meaning, in order to better define women’s representational status within pornography. Then, I will focus on audiences, trying to understand how different types of spectators engage with and reprocess diverse pornographic materials. Lastly, I will analyse the ways in which women have made their work careers within commercial pornography. From this research work, I expect to be able to provide an exhaustive analysis of the status of women within contemporary (audio-visual) pornography, trying to go past stereotypical assumptions, whether negative or positive.",1,0

The platform will be then exposed to the health care experts for evaluation to conclude with the elaboration of the Exploitation Plan of the products.",0,0
230,200159,No,Forecasting Change in Vegetation Dependant Ecosystem Functions.,"Patterns observed among twenty first century climate change imply a warmer and wetter climatic environment in the near to mid-term (50-150 years). Changes in climate results in changes in vegetation patterns as plant species shift there respective range. Subsequently, large-scale shifts in vegetation composition in response to climate change will impact upon vegetation dependent ecosystem functioning (structure and dynamics) and in-turn on the ecosystem services on which human societies depend.  Understanding therefore  how ecosystem functions respond to changing climate is extremely relevant for the development and implementation of successful European policy on climate change mitigation. This project will develop novel hybrid species distribution models (SDM) at national and European scales. The models will circumvent several limitations renowned with SDMs, through incorporating mechanistic simulations of species dispersal and establishment probabilities among a changing climate. Furthermore, these hybrid models will be validated, not by using the same spatial-temporal data but using an independent fine-scale temporal data-set. This unique and independent data originates from experimental field studies investigating impacts of warming and precipitation on Norwegian alpine vegetation. The model parametrization and validation phase of this project will result in a modeling framework that can be used to accurately forecast species range patterns and in-turn evaluate climate change impacts on ecosystems functions at the European-wide scale. .",0,0
860,195568,No,Genetic analysis of rare and common variation in a large Brazilian bipolar family,"This proposal describes my aim to use a uniquely large multigenerational family to better understand the genetic underpinnings of mood disorders: the Brazilian Bipolar Family (BBF). The family has a high incidence of mood disorders, featuring diminishing age of onset over generations and assortative mating, whereby many of the marriages in the family are between individuals with a psychiatric disorder. Mood disorders are leading contributors to the global burden of disease. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of elevated mood and periods of depression. Major depressive disorder is characterized by pervasive and persistent low mood, low self-esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Heritability estimates are 37% for MDD and up to 75% for BP. The current picture for complex disorders is of a genetic architecture consisting of both common and rare variants contributing risk. Genetic studies of mood disorders have not yet individual variants/genes accounting for a large increase in risk. The effect of common variants in the family context is unclear. I propose to utilize the BBF as a unique resource for studying both common and rare variation in mood disorders. Its size offers a powerful means for mapping genetic loci for mood disorders that are individually rare but common within the family. It also provides us with a unique model in which to analyse individual genetic risk profiles, utilizing the large sample size of and predictive ability of previous case-control association studies for each family member into a polygenic risk score. This will also allow me to assess assortative mating, which may act to increase polygenic risk to mood disorders over generations. I will develop an approach which will allow me to incorporate genome-wide case-control study results into family studies – something with broad utility for the field. My study will shed light on the genetic pathology of mood disorders, aiding prevention and treatment.",0,0
863,43448,No,Economic determinants of the distribution of health and health care in Europe,"Objectives: * To examine the role of financial factors - especially user charges, private insurance and income - in determining individuals' utilisation of health services.  * To examine the determinants of private insurance and the existence of adverse selection in the health insurance market.  * To examine the extent of, and the role of economic factors in generating inequalities in health.  Brief description: The project is a response to the concerns that have been expressed in several European countries over the possible adverse consequences, in terms of both equity in health care utilisation and inequalities in health, of the continued growth of user charges, private health insurance and income inequality. The first aim of the project is to explore the role of user charges, private insurance and income in influencing health care utilisation in various European countries. The structure of user charges will be analysed, especially their relationship with income, as will the effect of user charges of the poor and those in higher income groups and to the variation across countries in the impact of user charges on utilisation. The effects of private insurance (moral hazard) and income will also be explored, again in a comparative context. The second aim of the project is to establish the economic determinants of the demand for private health insurance. This has an important equity dimension in its own right but is also important given the scope for choice of insurance coverage and the need to take this into account when trying to estimate the moral hazard effect. One of the factors to e explored in this work is the possibility that high anticipated expenditures may encourage people to demand private insurance (adverse selection). As in the case of the first objective, the aim is to shed light on cross-country differences as well as country-specific factors. The third aim of the project is to compare the levels of inequalities in health in the European countries and to establish the role of economic factors in accounting for (a) cross-country differences in health inequality and (b) intra-country health variations. Statistical tests will be conducted to ascertain the statistical significance of cross-country differences. The analyses of the economic determinants of health and health inequalities will involve the estimation of micro and macro-econometric models of the demand for health.

It provides high quality guidance, mentoring and training for refugee researchers, especially postdocs and professors displaced for more than two years in Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Austria, Switzerland, Germany and Sweden. BRiDGE II aims to meet their individual career planning needs by providing 300 career case plans, while activating and supporting 190 academic and 90 industrial mentors, along with EURAXESS network members. It provides four trainings, four webinars and two networking events for refugee researchers, two trainings and two networking events for academic and industrial mentors, and fitting webinars for them to enhance the quality of collaboration and increase the success rate of their mentorship. BRiDGE II launches four peer groups and provides 45 internships/months for refugee researchers. The project trains and involves additional EURAXESS staff members across the European Research Area and provides course materials, guidelines and tools for further public use. It supports dual career and gender equality measures, by introducing a quota and piloting a dual career study for refugee researchers. The project partners strive to anchor diversity as a positive value in society and fight prejudice and discrimination against minorities in academia and society. The long-term integration of refugees in the academic and non-academic labour markets is an important step towards achieving this and is beneficial to many facets of society. Finally, the project establishes an advisory board of experts and community representatives, which will in turn provide insights concerning this important societal change and makes this information available to the public for further analysis and conclusions.",0,0
721,90290,No,IRCSET International Mobility Fellowships in Science Engineering and Technology: co-funded by Marie Curie Actions,"The objective of this programme is to refine an existing fellowship scheme, enabling Experienced Researchers to undertake up to two years of research outside of Ireland, with a one-year return period to Ireland.   Eligible researchers are Experienced Researchers (ER, EU definition) of any nationality and/or residency, who received the majority of their research training in Ireland, and who have been an ER for no more than 5 years (careers breaks of up to 5 years exempted).    ERs can freely choose the host organizations for the outgoing phase worldwide and for the return phase in Ireland. The research project may be of any topic that falls within the broad area of Science, Engineering and Technology. The choice of host organizations and research topic must be made fitting the researchers’ career development needs.   The mobility period abroad will allow the fellows to add an international dimension to their research career and to gain additional skills and expertise. The return phase will allow the fellows to integrate fully back into Ireland, both utilizing and transferring the various skills they acquired during the outgoing phase. The entire fellowship will broaden and deepen the scientific and complementary skills of the researchers, thereby contributing to the career development of the researchers. Career development support mechanisms are provided for.  IRCSET will execute and manage the programme. IRCSET already operates a number of research fellowship schemes, and will appoint a dedicated Programme Leader to the new scheme.

1056,187824,No,Demographic and Selective effects on the Quantitative Genetics of Ninespine Sticklebacks,"The aim of this project is to use the ninespine stickleback as a model to understand the relative importance of natural selection and random demographic events in shaping the evolution of ecologically relevant complex traits; harness the demographic history of the stickleback to detect complex genetic interactions affecting complex traits; improve the empirical understanding of the genetics of complex traits, and explore the effect of copy number variation (CNV) on complex traits. I will employ the latest genomic technologies to produce a panel of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to map Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). I will test the effects of selection and demographic history with Qst-Fst analysis, to determine which genomic regions are subject to selection across populations and which ones have population specific effects. Identifying population specific QTL will allow improving our empirical understanding of how QTL interact with their genetic background, providing novel insight to understand context-dependent genetic effects. I will use the data generated for QTL mapping to detect the presence of CNV, and I will test the relative importance of this kind of genetic variability in the establishment of quantitative traits variability. These results are expected to significantly impact on our current understanding of the distribution of adaptive variation in the wild, and lead to significant advancements in the theoretical framework of adaptive quantitative genetics. In addition, these results will have a direct impact in informing selective and breeding practices of domesticated animals and plants, to balance the need of preserving genetic variability while allowing for an efficient genetic and phenotypic response to artificial selection. It will also provide us greater knowledge to effectively manage endangered species fragmented in disjointed populations which are simultaneously facing both genetic diversity loss and anthropic and climate change selection.",0,0
373,102589,No,Towards Enhanced III-V Tunnel Transistors,"'Tunnel transistors are currently considered promising candidates for future low-power high performance information processing applications. The proposed project TETTRA – Towards Enhanced III-V Tunnel TRAnsistors – is dedicated to the fabrication and characterization of III-V nanowire tunnel field-effect transistors (FETs). III-V semiconductor heterostructure nanowires, grown on Si substrates by means of the selective-area-epitaxy method, serve as basis for the tunnel FETs. The project concentrates on n-type tunnel FETs and furthermore focuses on one specific realization with regard to the choice of materials involved; i.e. n-type tunnel FETs consisting of a p-type GaSb source, an InxGa1-xAs channel, and an n-type InAs drain. This sequence of III-V materials is grown in the form of vertical heterostructure nanowires directly on silicon substrates, with InAs being in contact with the substrate and GaSb forming the nanowire tip. The heterostructure nanowires are then processes into vertical, gate-all-around tunnel FETs. The fabrication of the nanowire heterostructure and the processing of the III-V nanowire tunnel represent one of two main objectives of the project. Investigations on the growth of GaSb on InxGa1-xAs, on the p-doping of GaSb, and on metal contacts to GaSb are preceding the tunnel FET fabrication. The second objective of the project comprises the electrical characterization of the nanowire-oxide interface properties and the electrical characterization of III-V tunnel FETs. For characterizing the nanowire-oxide interface properties two independent techniques will be employed: capacitance-voltage measurements and the charge-pumping technique. Both deliver the interface trap level density, Dit, and both have been demonstrated to be applicable to single nanowire capacitors and FETs, respectively. Characterization is complemented by detailed investigations of the electrical properties of the III-V nanowire tunnel FETs.'",0,0
451,71238,No,The application of polymer electronics towards ambient intelligence,"Things that think and the communication of people with such things in his environment critically depend on contactless communication technologies. RF communication devices and protocols have been developed in the past and exist today, yet in their present form they cannot and will never be used on a large scale to allow communication with everyday objects.  The fundamental reason for this is the cost of the silicon technology employed to realize it. Even in its most optimistic projection, this cost remains at least one order of magnitude higher than the cost of a technology that has been proven to be truly ubiquitously applicable, such as a barcode. Therefore, a new generation of devices is required to enable ambient intelligence at the right cost point in order to be truly applicable everywhere and anywhere.  The objective of PolyApply is to lay the foundations of a scalable and ubiquitously applicable communication technology. The boundary condition is the cost of the microsystem, combining basic RF communication with sensor functions. The key to achieving a fundamentally different cost point than what will be reachable in the future with the evolution of the existing technologies (e.g. CMOS), is to resolutely move to adisruptive new manufacturing technology: going from batch processing to in-line manufacturing technology.  The semiconductor system envisaged to this end is based on polymers. The scalable aspect refers to the fact that PolyApply does not plan to propose a solution for a certain generation of RF communication devices useful at one point in time, but rather intends to develop generic technologies with a meaningful impact in the mid- and long term. In other words, the developed technologies will lead to an extendable family of products, ranging from 'simple' RF tags at ultra-low cost to RF communication devices with complex functionality such as integrated re-writable memory, sensory inputs, display, etc",0,0
967,88682,No,Statistical Tools for studying genetic architecture,"Molecular biology has shown that most phenotypes are affected by complex, interacting gene networks. Yet, evolutionary biologists and population geneticists often assume very simple genetic architectures where genes act more of less independently of each other. These assumptions are made for conceptual clarity and are partially justified through statistical definitions of gene effects that capture the main effects of alleles as averages over many complex interactions. Still, recent research has revealed many systematic patterns of epistasis and pleiotropy with population genetic effects that should not be ignored. This makes a detailed understanding of genetic architecture important for many questions in evolutionary biology, including the basis of evolvability, and also instrumental for many questions in animal and crop improvement, including our ability to predict selection limits and to avoid unwanted side effects of artificial selection.   The philosophy of this project is to develop methods that yield operational measurements of dynamically relevant parameters. A serious problem is the study of genetic architecture has been that many of the parameters in use are not derived from process models, epistatic variance components being the most obvious example. For this reason, it is necessary to combine the statistical models with process models to ensure a general understanding of the meaning of estimators.",0,0

Based on theories of cultural heritage-making, exposing the commonalities of past and present experiences, listening to the target groups’ needs and through the development of a methodology template of co-creative design of replicable digital tools and cultural products, SO-CLOSE will improve social cohesion and promote mutual understanding between refugees and their local communities.  The resulting data and methodology will be used to develop several digital applications, for which purpose we have in our consortium strong technological partners with experience in this field. Working at the intersection of history, sociology, cultural studies, art and computer science, SO-CLOSE will design educational and cultural tools like interactive cookbooks, interactive documentaries based on immersive video recording, AI-powered Chatbots, interactive exhibitions based on personal memories and storytelling or an online platform, named Memory Center, built as a content aggregator and services platform. SO-CLOSE development will be implemented in four different pilot locations, selected due to their similarities with the present and for the actual existence of memory and intangible cultural heritage:  - VDA, Krakow (Poland) - Trikeri Island Concentration Camp (Greece) - MUME de l’Exili (Spain) - MONTE Marzabotto (Italy  Planned Memory Center interactive platform with its embedded repository of multimedia content and advances services, will be a global instrument transforming old-fashioned museums in Living Labs through designing new cultural experiences based on the cultural heritage of refugees addressing to generate social awareness.",0,0
167,45649,No,Assessing debate and participative technology assessment,"Overall objective of the proposed project  The overall objective of the proposed project is to further the understanding of the development of public debate and participatory technology assessment by systematically analysing and comparing several (15) experiences carried out in the field of biotechnology and other technologies in the following European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom.  This will be done by investigating and comparing case studies on four dimensions:  - the emergence of public debate,  - the social shaping of the debated problem,  - the institutional structuring of the forum,  - the way to consider the impacts and results.  The aim of the project is to facilitate the promotion of public debate on science and technology policy at regional and national levels in Europe.  The proposed project is part of ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) of the biotechnology programme and fits with the objectives (stated in the supplementary information):  - Understanding and answering public attitudes and diversity of viewpoints,as well as the social shaping of public attitudes,  - Fulfilling a prospective role, anticipating the problems and providing early warnings for new ethical, social and legal issues.  The general approach of the proposed project comprises basically the following stages:  1 - A general overview of participative technology assessment and public debate experiences in European countries will be given(task 1);  2 - In depth analysis of participative technology assessment and public debate concrete cases in the field of biotechnology and other technologies (tasks 2, 3, 4);  3 - International comparison of the in depth analyses covering several different dimensions will be made: according to some levels such as: technology (biotechnology versus other technologies), country, institutional structuring, impacts (tasks 6);  4 - Finalization of the project (task 8);  5 - Two important discussion steps structure the research process:   - a first international workshop for the presentation and reflection on the in depth analyses of national experiences (task 5),   - a second international workshop, policy focused, for the presentation and discussion of the European comparative analysis and policy recommendations to the European Commission(task 7).

235,99586,No,Physical built environments and health inequalities,"Recent multidisciplinary research has found that inequalities in health status between populations living in areas differentiated by area-level measures of social deprivation continue to increase in most countries in the EU and elsewhere. However, the mechanisms underpinning rising health inequalities are poorly understood. The focus of this study is Scotland, a country with particularly poor health outcomes and high levels of health inequalities. Using novel methods this study aims to investigate the role of various environmental characteristics in shaping health inequalities. Sophisticated Geographical Information Systems measures of environmental exposure for small areas across Scotland will be derived. This research will be the first to simultaneously develop custom designed environmental measures for different social and demographic groups. These measures will be appended to a range of health data sets. Historical environmental data will be juxtaposed with longitudinal health data to provide cumulative environmental exposure measures over the life course. Statistical modelling will be used to examine the effects of the environment in shaping inequalities in smoking, obesity, and mental health. The findings from the research will provide important new knowledge about the intersection of the physical, social and economic environments and their influence on health experiences, behaviours and outcomes. New insights into the role of mobility and migration in shaping environmental exposures and resulting health outcomes will also be provided. An important outcome will be to establish a centre of research excellence that will develop a strong and sustainable international profile in the area of Environment and Health research.",0,0

Background: Poor adolescent reproductive health (ARH) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and worsening poverty for the poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa. The effectiveness of ARH programmes implemented within the health and education sectors is seriously hampered by adverse prevailing cultural norms and practices within those sectors and the wider community, and by poor programme integration. Methods: The proposed research will promote equitable reproductive health (RH) service provision and improve its uptake and effectiveness by : (i) conducting a situation analysis of current community and implementer experiences of existing ARH programmes in Tanzania and Niger, identifying priority areas of weakness in RH service provision and opportunities for strengthened service uptake and integration; (ii) addressing identified weaknesses and opportunities by developing an innovative package of interventions in 4 areas: (1) workplace ARH strategy in health units; (2) RH support to teachers in schools; (3) integrated school and community guardian support to pupils; (4) enhanced community referral to health services. We will evaluate the processes and impact of the interventions through a series of rigorous process evaluation studies, which will generate new knowledge, about intervention development, and indicators of intervention processes and effect. The overall impact of the interventions will be evaluated in a population-based cluster randomised trial. Involvement as project partners of the government ministries directly responsible for ARH policy in both Niger and Tanzania, will ensure the policy-relevance of this research, and its continued impact beyond the life of this project.",0,1
383,72976,No,The diplomacy of immigration: migration issues in transnational relations,"Europe is an immigration continent yet it still needs to develop migration and ethnic studies. Virginie Guiraudon proposes to come to the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, Italy to teach and supervise junior researchers from the EU and beyond about migration, the integration of migrants in host societies, the impact of migration, immigration policies and related issues such as citizenship and nationhood in multicultural societies. In addition to training EUI Ph.D. students, she will organise workshops and summer schools open to participants beyond the EUI. She will also collaborate on research projects managed by the EUI Robert Schuman Center (e. g. on the impact of migration in sending countries). While at the EUI, she will study the role of the immigration issue in the diplomacy of the European Union (EU). Since the 1999 Tampere summit, a common immigration policy is a EU priority. Originally a prerogative of Interior and Justice ministries, the control of immigration into the EU is an objective that pervades EU policy areas such as aid to development, external trade, and enlargement. The issue of immigration has become integrated in the external relations of the EU. First, she will examine EU policies that seek to prevent migration at the source focusing on initiatives concerning countries South of the Mediterranean. The goal is to understand how norms and practices regarding the management of migration flows are elaborated, diffused or imposed on states. Her research design will confront rational and constructivist perspectives; she will compare EU-led processes with other multilateral initiatives and study the implementation and impact of initiatives in several Southern Mediterranean countries. She will study the role of immigration in transatlantic relations, especially on post-9/11 cooperation between the EU and the United States, especially on negotiations regarding airline passenger information, biometrics in visas and passports.",0,0

Debates on Faith and Reason in Early modern Europe, 1668-1710""""","'The project is a historical reconstruction of the philosophical debates concerning faith and reason in the Early Modern Republic of Letters as seen through the eyes of the German polymath G.W. Leibniz (1646-1716). It will be conducted at the Centre d’Etudes en Rhétorique, Philosophie et Histoire des Idees (CERPHI UMR 5037), a research unit based at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon. It will be supervised by the director of CERPHI, Professor Pierre-François Moreau.  The project contains three parts. First, it reconstructs the conceptual framework, which governs Leibniz’s analysis, evaluation and strategic approach to other thinkers, positions and doctrines in the early modern Republic of Letters, with special emphasis on the controversies concerning faith and reason. This provides a historically immanent methodological framework for the study of those debates. It also provides an original account of Leibniz’s position as a philosopher in the Early Modern Republic of Letters, a powerful proponent of what is today referred to as the “moderate Enlightenment.” In Part II, I study in detail Leibniz’s engagement with a series of other, contemporary theoretical positions on the relations between faith and reason. These positions include Padouan Averroism, Mechanism, Naturalism and Materialism, Catholic Fideism, Erudite Libertinism, Theological and Philosophical Enthusiasm, Rational theology, and Calvinist Scepticism. The seven case studies currently planned form the bulk of the project. Finally, in Part III, the project includes a set of appendices containing translations into English of a series of generally unknown French and Latin texts by Leibniz. The project is a strongly interdisciplinary and draws on research from both philosophy, history, theology, comparative literature, and the history of science.'""",0,0
262,90207,No,Molecular Basis of Neuronal Ageing,"Ageing is associated with marked decrease of neuronal function and increased susceptibility to neurodegeneration, in organisms as diverse as the lowly worm Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. Although, age-related deterioration of the nervous system is a universal phenomenon, its cellular and molecular underpinnings remain obscure. What mechanisms are responsible for the detrimental effects of ageing on neuronal function? The aim of the proposed research programme is to address this fundamental problem.  We will implement an interdisciplinary approach, combining the power of C. elegans, a highly malleable genetic model which offers a precisely defined nervous system, with state-of-the-art microfluidics and optical imaging technologies, to manipulate and monitor neuronal activity during ageing, in vivo.  Our objectives are four-fold. First, develop a microfluidics platform for high-throughput manipulation and imaging of specific neurons in individual animals, in vivo. Second, use the platform to monitor neuronal function during ageing in isogenic populations of wild type animals, long-lived mutants and animals under caloric restriction, a condition known to extend lifespan from yeast to primates. Third, examine how ageing modulates susceptibility to neuronal damage in nematode models of human neurodegenerative disorders. Fourth, conduct both forward and reverse genetic screens for modifiers of resistance to ageing-inflicted neuronal function decline. We will seek to identify and thoroughly characterize genes and molecular pathways involved in neuron deterioration during ageing. Ultimately, we will investigate the functional conservation of key isolated factors in more complex ageing models such as Drosophila and the mouse.  Together, these studies will lead to an unprecedented understanding of age-related breakdown of neuronal function and will provide critical insights with broad relevance to human health and quality of life.",0,0
109,208740,Yes,Images in Exile:Gender and representations among Syrian Kurdish women in Norway,"The project Images in Exile (IMEX) addresses the current refugee crisis and its implications for Syrian Kurdish women in Europe. It challenges images about Muslim women, who are often the subject of debates on the supposed dichotomy between an imagined secular progressive West and religious backwards East. Kurdish women disrupt this dichotomy through an alternative portrayal in global media. Whereas Kurds were previously often pictured as terrorists, backward, and conservative, they are now presented as courageous fighters against, and victims of, Islamic terrorism; and as progressive forces that include women in their ranks. Ideas about progressive, feminist and secular forms of governance are strongly developed in Kurdish political thought, and central in local self-representations.  However, media representations and political ideology often differ from social realities on the ground. Going beyond these representations, this study will investigate Kurdish women’s experiences in a rapidly changing socio-political context. It aims at developing better insights into migrant women’s integration and participation in European societies. IMEX thus directly responds to an important policy priority of the H2020 work programme, and targets a better gender and equality balance.  Building on extensive research experience in the Middle East and Europe, and the knowledge of Kurdish, IMEX will carry out field research among refugees and migrant organizations in Norway. Methods include narrative interviews with 40 women, focus group interviews, and action research through the set-up of a photo exhibition. The host organization is the Centre for Gender Research at Oslo University, a leading Gender institute in the Nordic region. Dissemination is directed towards high academic quality and policy development. IMEX strongly contributes to the researcher’s career prospects and to the broadening of the Centre’s research agenda, and responds to an urgent societal concern.",1,1
1091,82627,No,"Biochemical and cell biological characterization of BRX, a novel regulator of root architecture in Arabidopsis, and its role in hormone homeostasis","In past years, mutagenesis approaches have proven immensely successful in dissecting the genetics of plant development. While genes that qualitatively affect plant development are very useful for understanding the mechanistic basis of growth and development, these genes appear less likely targets for the evolution of plant morphology than genes that modify the quantitative expression of a trait.  Exploiting natural genetic variation enables the detection of alleles that give rise to variation observed within species, which are generally much less characterized than qualitative traits. Natural genetic variation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been touted as an untapped resource to understand plant genetics and development.  The novel Arabidopsis gene, BREVIS RADIX (BRX), was identified using natural variation to isolate regulators that are responsible for intraspecific variation in root system morphology.  BRX encodes a protein of unknown function and is the founding member of a small, plant-specific gene family, which is highly conserved among angiosperm species. The primary focus of the proposed research is to elucidate the biochemical, physiological, and cell biological functions of BRX.  To this end, my specific aims are to: - determine the role BR X plays in coordination of auxin and brassinosteroid signalling; - understand the regulation and function of the BRX protein; and - define the cell biological and physiological effects of presence or absence of BRX activity by microarray analysis of BRX-inducible lines.  The proposed research will result in the first detailed characterization of the biochemical and cell biological function of BRX, the founding member of a novel, plant-specific gene family.  Moreover, the brxS mutation provides a unique tool to address how auxin and brassinosteroids exert combinatorial control at the molecular level.",0,0
245,93088,No,HERA Joint Research Programme,"The HERA Joint Research Programme (HERA JRP) partners will launch a joint call for multilateral projects in two humanities research areas: “Cultural Dynamics” and “Creativity and Innovation”. By setting up a HERA JRP, the 13 national funding partners want to create collaborative, trans-national research opportunities that will derive new insights from humanities research in order to address major social, cultural, and political challenges facing Europe. In consultation with their national researcher communities, they have jointly defined and developed common research priorities, and created a new trans-national funding mechanism. They have also pooled a substantial amount of their funding in one common pot, thus increasing the efficiency and impact of public research funding. The two HERA JRP themes – “Cultural Dynamics” and “Creativity and Innovation” respond to the thematic priority issues defined in the FP7 “Cooperation” Work Programme for Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities. With the coordination of substantial research support mobilised by national funding agencies, the HERA JRP complements the existing FP7 research funding instruments by offering a more flexible suite of funding opportunities for both basic and policy-oriented trans-national collaborative research. The selection phase of the HERA JRP involves the final preparatory activities for the Call for proposals and a commonly-agreed two-stage evaluation process involving meetings of two independent, international Review Panels and remote assessments by expert referees. In the research phase, the HERA JRP will support scientific networking activities in order to foster new innovative research. The HERA JRP knowledge transfer strategy will stimulate wider public awareness about the important contributions of new humanities research.

153,225914,Yes,A slow release insemination that doubles the success rate of the most common first line treatment of infertility.,"Infertility impacts 25 million European citizens and 90 million couples globally (1 in 6 couples). Europe’s total fertility rate is among the lowest in the world, at 1.5 children per woman, a figure that is expected to decrease further to 1.2 by 2030 – making it a critical public health issue. Typically, infertility is treated with intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF. IUI is the most common first-line treatment as it is non-invasive and relatively cheap, but its success rate of around 7% means that IVF, a far more expensive and invasive procedure, with an overall success rate of around 30% becomes necessary. The market needs an affordable, easily accessible, non-invasive alternative that increases the success rate. EVIE 2.0 is a patent protected, fully automatic slow release insemination device that bypasses the hostile cervix to slowly release sperm into the uterus over four hours via a proprietary balloon catheter and an insemination syringe. Unlike standard Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), EVIE mimics nature by slowly and gently releasing the sperm - maximizing the opportunity for the sperm to reach the egg and increasing the prospect of fertilization - more than doubling the success rate of 7.2% to 18.7% and decreasing the average cost per pregnancy. EVIE 2.0 will transform the infertility market by providing an alternative non-invasive first-line treatment solution with increased success rate, reducing the need for couples to resort to expensive and complex treatments. To have EVIE 2.0 fully projected at a European and global level we need a further investment of €2.5M to complete all product development, scale-up and complete a clinical study. The proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME instrument fits into our overall plan to reach the market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast, sound and widee deployment of EVIE 2.0.",0,1
219,65227,No,Supramolecular arrays for non-covalent dna recognition,"Aim: To develop synthetic supramolecular agents that recognize DNA, to investigate the effects they have on the DNA structure and the potential for achieving these in a sequence selective manner Rationale and Summary: Natural biomolecule recognition of DNA relies primarily on non-covalent binding of large protein motifs to DNA. Supramolecular chemistry provides methodology for the design of large synthetic arrays of similar size and shape to such protein motifs. Such supramolecular non-covalent DNA binding agents will be designed and prepared and their DNA binding investigated. This will be achieved by preparing a synthetic library of supramolecular cylinders bearing different functional groups and combinations of groups on the surface and screening their DNA binding both for their effect on the DNA and for sequence selectivity. This will be achieved through the following objectives: 1. Preparation of libraries of surface functionalized supramolecular cylinders 2. Investigation of the DNA binding of the components of the library and estimation of binding strengths 3. Investigation of the global structural effects on DNA induced by binding 4. Investigation of sequence specificity of binding 5. Optimization of cylinder design and functionality to achieve specific structural effects in a sequence specific manner. This multi-disciplinary project will provide me with advanced training in design and preparation of non-covalent DNA recognition agents (the expertise of Dr. Hannon), will enhance my expertise of circular dichroism and its application to DNA binding drugs and will extend this to give me new expertise in the technique of flow linear dicllroism for probing drug-DNA interactions (the expertise of Dr. Rodger) and in AFM imaging. Such an advanced trailing at the interface of Chemistry and Biology is facilitated by the complementary expertises of these two scientists who collaborate closely together and this makes Warwick the ideal place to gain such a training. In particular, expertise in flow linear dichroisru and its applications are restricted to only a few laboratories in the world and I hope to establish this technique in the Czech Republic on my return at the end of the fellowship. The range of training opportunities in both research and teaching available through the University of Warwick Academic Staff Development program will also be valuable in preparing and enabling me to establish a successful scientific research career on my return to the Czech Republic.",0,0

As recent discoveries in Turkey make clear, writing did not replace prehistoric means of administration throughout Mesopotamian history. In addition, newly found traces of pigments on early cuneiform tablets invite us to reconsider the main writing medium – i.e. clay – as a complex one. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the project will output an innovative monograph, which will re-assess the role of writing in the ancient urban cultures of the Near East, and more broadly in cultural evolution. The research will focus on both Philology of cuneiform sources — no coherent study on ancient terminology for writing and accounting  is presently available —, and Art History, in order to look for as yet unrecognized representations of ancient devices in the iconographic record. The research will be informed by original Digital Humanities solutions for data mining of cuneiform texts (PostgreSQL database, Python scripts). In addition, comparative Anthropology will provide a broader theoretical background to test assumptions and possible interpretations. The action will open up diverse academic opportunities for the researcher, including a professorship in Europe, either in History of the Ancient Near East or in Digital Humanities, thanks to the newly acquired expertise in History of sciences and programming languages. Through seminars and workshops, the host will benefit from the researcher’s expertise in comparative study of writing systems, as well as from his academic network.

555,75318,No,"New molecules in mood disorders: a genomic, neurobiological and systems approach in animal models and human disorder","Depression is common and affects twice as many women as men. In the global burden of disease survey, it is the fourth most prevalent cause of disability, greater than eg cardiovascular disease. Gender, social and familial factors increase risk for depression, but little is known about how these influences work in the brain, least of all at the molecular level. Newer antidepressant treatments still act in the same way as 30 years ago and their downstream molecular actions are obscure. At most 65% of new episodes respond to drug-treatment and chronic, treatment-resistant depression is a major health burden. This is a major collaboration between 13 clinical and basic science groups in 10 EU countries which addresses the evident need to discover: New molecular mechanisms in the causation of depression. New molecular mechanisms of effective drug-treatment. We will measure three fundamental processes underlying depression - the inability to experience pleasure, excessive sensitivity to stress and negative appraisal of circumstances. This will enable us to cross-validate findings, in humans and animal models. In animals we will use a mixture of well-established and novel methods for inducing genetic and mild stress-related changes in the three processes. We will detect the molecular mechanisms involved by creating the NEWMOOD microarray chip and measuring changes in gene expression. Changes which are consistent across many models will become targets for new treatments. In addition we will search for neurochemical changes in how monoamine and other neurones are regulated which are shared by the models. These too will become new molecular targets.

WONT-HATE investigates phenomena of online misogyny, such as gender-based hate speech, rape threats and image-based sexual harassment, against highly visible, political and institutional figures in Europe. More specifically, WONT-HATE maps the multimodal discursive and rhetorical strategies of online hate against women in politics across four different linguistic landscapes and political cultures in Europe, namely Italy, Spain, France and the U.K.  WONT-HATE is characterized by a multimodal critical discursive approach to cyberhate, entailing a quantitative and qualitative investigation of a corpus of Youtube videos and relative user-generated comments. WONT-HATE is to contribute to the current debate on the use of social media data for social research, providing new critical theoretical perspectives as well as a transdisciplinary methodology for data selection and collection and for the contextualization of the new dynamics of digital interaction. Two secondments, at the University of Vienna and Newcastle University, further contribute to establishing a dialogue on cutting-edge social media approaches across Europe.  WONT-HATE is also to yield an open access database of online misogyny speech, encompassing its lexico-syntactic and discursive features in Italian, Spanish, French and English, to foster academic research and the advancement of software solutions to the issue. Exploring discourse as social practice, and refusing to treat the ‘online’ and the ‘offline’ as separate and independent realms, WONT-HATE tackles timely issues of digital security, gender-based violence and gender equality, in line with the gender-related objectives of the Horizon 2020 Programme and the EU Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019.",1,1
659,63324,No,PRIvacy Enhancement in Data Management in E-Health for GENomic medicine,"Genomic medicine encompasses predictive and diagnostic genetic testing. Information derived from genetic testing will also help in selecting or fashioning the best drug or other therapeutic regimen for a patient, e.g. one that maximizes efficacy but minimizes side effects (what is called pharmacogenetics). Due to the highly sensitive nature of today's electronic interchange of individually identifiable genetic data serious concerns about privacy have been raised. An advantageous approach for protecting privacy is based on so-called Privacy Enhancing Techniques (P.E.T.s), which are methods that prevent the unauthorised or inappropriate (direct or indirect) establishment of a person's identity. CUSTODIX provides pseudonymisation trust services and through the PRIDEH project wants to encourage the take-up of such activities. Genomic medicine deals with very sensitive data and therefore privacy is ever so important in that field.  Objectives: The main aim of this cluster project is to establish co-operation between two projects (PRIDEH and INFOGENE) and two fields (e-Security / PETs and Medical Genomics) as to maximise interaction and obtain mutual benefits. Regarding privacy protection and genomic medicine in particular, it is important to recognise and further identify the domain-specific problems. A better understanding of these characteristic issues will lead to more specific and better-adapted privacy protection measures.  Work description: INFOGENE (Interactive platform For personal Genetic profile construction, decision and support) (IST-2001-33402) will link, through networks, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to a multilingual web-based system in order to guide users in registering their personal genetic profile and family disease history. The system will give its users confidential personal advice and easy-to-understand, but quality-assessed knowledge, pertaining to their individual health conditions. PRIDEH (Privacy Enhancement in Data Management in E-Health)(IST-2001-32647) is an accompanying measure that concentrates on Privacy Enhancing Techniques (P.E.T.s)-based services. CUSTODIX is the co-ordinator of the PRIDEH project and has implemented Batch and Interactive Pseudonymisation Services. Through the use of such PET-based services (pseudonymisation) personal health data can be much better protected from unauthorised use or disclosure. This project proposal will bring together the two leading partners of both projects: VITAMIB for INFOGENE and CUSTODIX for PRIDEH in order to produce guidelines for the protection of privacy in the context of genetics related data exchange. The guidelines will be the synthesis of an analysis conducted by both partners viewed from their domain specific perspectives: the domain of Privacy Enhancing Techniques and the domain of Genomics.  Milestones: The project will result in added value for both projects. PRIDEH will gain a better understanding in the specific privacy protection requirements in genomic medicine. INFOGENE, which is developing E-Services through its INFOGENE server, will gain a better understanding of privacy protection solutions for E-Health. The knowledge gathered by both parties will be made publicly available in guidelines.",0,0

308,216301,No,Effects of co-infections on the emergence of an avian disease Mycoplasma gallisepticum,"The investigation of processes that trigger cross-species transmission (‘spillover’) is central to disease ecology and epidemiology. Many infectious diseases in humans and domestic animals have emerged from successful jumps from wildlife hosts. The interactions of coinfecting pathogens within the same host are considered to be important in these spillover processes. However, despite the relevance of coinfections, little is known about the copathogen dynamics in the wild. There is a need for general concepts and theories. “Ecodis” proposes to fill this gap by determining a conceptual framework for effects of copathogens on disease transmission in one of the world’s best studied parasite-songbird systems: the directly-transmitted Mycoplasma gallisepticum bacteria in House Finches. Using methods from disease ecology and human epidemiology, I (Dr. Heylen; the applying experienced researcher) combine experimental and field surveillance data to create models on cross-host infection risks. These innovative models will improve our understanding of the roles of coinfections in mediating pathogen establishment and persistence in novel host species and previously unexposed populations. I will be guided by high-profile scientists, Hens (Hasselt University) and Dobson (Princeton University), and benefit from their extensive networks to develop a set of crucial skills that boost my research profile and expertise in constructing/applying mathematical and theoretical models in disease ecology. Following the ‘One Health’ vision, this multidisciplinary and highly translational project will allow me to develop an international career as disease ecologist, and - in the long-term - to contribute to biodiversity and risk management programs in Europe and beyond.",0,0
46,191243,Yes,Infant Responses to Maternal Carrying in Human as Early Biomarker and Prognosis Estimator of Child Psychopathology: a Study on Autism Spectrum Disorders and Perinatal Brain Disorders in Early Infancy,"In this project we aim to understand the psycho-physiological aspects of mother-infant interaction and their paramount influence on typical and atypical development. Mother-infant bonding is the earliest and most critical social relationship of mammalian infants. To promote this bond, infants have innate behaviors to seek maternal proximity and protest upon separation via communication with the mother vocally and through body movement. However, the physiological mechanisms regulating these infant behaviors remain largely undefined. As a model to study very early mother infant interaction we study the maternal and filial contribution during maternal carrying. In a pioneering study (Esposito et al., 2013) we have shown in rodent pups and human infants a specific calming response to maternal carrying. This calming response is a coordinated set of central, motor, and cardiac regulations and is a conserved component of mammalian mother-infant interactions. During the proposed project we aim to test the hypothesis that: (i) the calming response to maternal carrying influence the efficiency of mother-infant interaction; (iia) very early malfunctioning of the infant contribution to maternal carrying may be an early biomarker of child psychopathology (i.e. Autism Spectrum Disorders, ASDs) and (iib) may provide an opportunity for an early estimation of prognosis in infants with Perinatal Brain Disorders (PBDs, i.e. Cerebral Palsy). The study will use physiological and behavioral assessment of infants with typical and atypical development. The present study provides immediate implications for general parenting practices and might provide a tool for the evaluation of the autonomic functions and sensory integrations of neurological disorders in early infancy. Finally, these results may contribute to elucidation of neurobiological mechanisms governing social bonding and cooperation in humans.",0,1
464,107688,No,Children’s personal epistemologies: capitalizing children and families knowledge in schools towards effective learning and teaching (ChiPE),"The conceptions of knowledge and knowing that students hold have increasingly become a focus of interest for educational researchers in the last decades. Research on personal epistemology has highlighted the educational relevance of students’ beliefs about knowledge and knowing  and its important role in students’ academic motivation, cognition, and performance. Relevant theoretical frameworks have advanced the knowledge on epistemological beliefs, despite those frameworks have been grounded in research conducted with adults such as university students, and with adolescents. Less research has been found that clarifies the relationship between learning contexts and types of instruction and children’s personal epistemologies, in order to foster effective teaching and learning in more inclusive classrooms, and ultimately increase educational success.  This research proposal aims to contributing to fill such gap by examining the personal epistemology of elementary school children, teachers and families participating in dialogic-based classrooms. This approach often contributes to enhance classroom’s “epistemic climate” composed of learners’ and teachers’ personal epistemologies and epistemic knowledge, but at the same time brings closer knowledge from children’s out-of-school experience to classroom knowledge. This research project will explore children and families’ epistemological beliefs in the school context to capitalise on their funds of knowledge and promote effective learning. In the framework of the EU Strategy 2020, it is crucial to make available for more schools and communities those actions that help citizens succeed educationally, and then gain access to the labour market and full participation in society.",0,0
974,218154,No,Bridging the treatment gap for mild and moderate anxiety and depression across EU,"Each year, 25% of the EU population suffer from depression or anxiety, with higher rates for women than men. The cost of mood disorders and anxiety in the EU is about €170 billion per year. In most of the EU countries, patients with mild and moderate anxiety and depression only get access to specialised treatment from mental health professionals when the illness become severe. In the future, the society will have major problems in providing good healthcare if we are not able prevent more: between 1990-2013 the number of people suffering from depression and/or anxiety increased by nearly 50%.   Experts emphasize that Internet-assisted treatments based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBTs) have a great potential to improve care for mental disorders, but current solutions are having a slow adoption by health providers, mental health professionals and patients because they are very generic, do not provide controls to guarantee medical effectiveness and/or have not been designed to be used by health providers. Explorable AS has developed the unique ICBT marketplace specially designed to be directly used by health providers. It includes an authoring tool so that practitioners at these health providers can easily create their owned ICBTs by implementing engaging technologies and gamified concepts. ICBTs will also be available to other practitioners working at other health providers. Patients only get access to ICBTs in our marketplace under the prescription of general or mental health practitioners: in that way we guarantee that patients get ICBTs with proven evidence-based therapies or best-practice methods, and they get access to specialised treatment designed by mental health professionals from the onset of their illness. The overall objective of Mind-Gap Phase 1 is to carry out a feasibility study to verify the technological, practical and economic viability of scaling up our platform to other EU countries (market replication).",0,0

912,215239,No,Infant Theory of Mind,"The project aims to advance knowledge of the development of Theory of Mind - the ability to reason about other’s beliefs. Specifically, the project will combine brain imaging techniques with adaptations to typical Theory of Mind tasks that will allow major theoretical advances in the understanding of infant social cognition. The use of brain imaging techniques to study the development of Theory of Mind is an upcoming research strategy made possible by recent advances in lower-cost infant appropriate techniques such as function Near Infrared Spectroscopy and places this project at the cutting edge of the field. Previously the experienced researcher has sought to evaluate the mechanisms underpinning corvid’s and children’s social behaviours and the Supervisor has independently sought to evaluate the mechanisms underpinning responses to complex social stimuli. The current project uses their joint backgrounds to facilitate the development of innovative behavioural paradigms that, in combination with the use of imaging techniques pioneered by a collaborating research lab, will allow the team to address key questions in infant Theory of Mind research. In addition to the research aspects of the proposal the project will allow the experienced researcher to learn to use imaging techniques on infants and will involve the dissemination of research through publications and conference talks. Furthermore, both the experienced researcher and Supervisor will continue their commitment to undertaking public engagement programs and are excited about exploring the new opportunities for exploiting their research that the project ensues.",0,0
17,83443,Yes,Work harder and have more babies? A political-economic analysis of the care economy: old-age provision,"The object of the present research project is the crisis of the welfare state with a focus on old-age provision. This crisis is viewed as being essentially a manifestation of two shocks: the exogenous shock is the restructuring of the global economy; the endogenous shock derives from the family which has provoked the problem of demographic ageing since this is nothing less than low fertility rates. Second, women's changed role has provoked the problem of redistribution of paid and unpaid work in the economy. Since enhanced female employment rates mean that the household's traditional caring capacities are being eroded. These trends affect the contribution-based social benefits such as retirement benefits. The challenge of ageing population puts into question the maintaining of adequate and sustainable pensions.  The political commitment to an enhanced labour market participation of women at the European level seems to engender a contradictory imperative at the individual level: to work harder in order to secure (private) provision for one's old age and, simultaneously, to have more children who will be able to sustain the public pension schemes once they are grown up. The interdisciplinary research proposal combines an economic analysis of changes that have taken place on the (world) market in the context of globalisation with an analysis, conducted from a political science perspective, of the reform of the welfare state and social change. Not that old age insurance should be regarded and tackled in isolation.  The effect of a pension policy and its reform is closely intertwined with fiscal and labour market policy. However, the sum total of societal welfare derives from inputs of three institutions: State, market and family. Women's role in non-market-based welfare production is essential. The aim is to make a contribution to a new economic theory framework including a comprehensive gendered analysis of welfare state reform.",1,1
1031,99384,No,Context dependent sexual selection and the dynamics of colonisation,"'One of the main goals of evolutionary biology is to understand the causes and consequences of genetic and phenotypic diversity. A key factor in this process of diversification is the ability of individuals to invade, colonize and adapt to novel habitats. A common feature of colonisation events is the introduction of animals from multiple source populations. Such genetic admixture can have important implications for both the ecological and evolutionary potential of introduced populations, through increases in genetic and phenotypic variance. Despite this, the impact of admixture on the fitness of introduced populations has received little empirical validation. The key reason for this is a lack of studies which link genetic diversity of introduced populations and the agents of selection acting on that diversity. This proposal is an ambitious, but highly achievable, development of a novel and innovative multi-disciplinary research agenda aimed at addressing this fundamental issue in evolutionary biology. Specifically, I will combine genetic, physiological, and behavioural techniques in natural, semi-natural and laboratory settings using the invasive wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, to examine the genetic context dependence of sexual selection and its role on population persistence and evolutionary diversification during colonisation. Specifically, I will experimentally manipulate the genetic admixture of semi-natural populations to provide direct tests of the strength, direction, and targets of sexual selection under different genetic contexts during colonisation events. This data will be used to parameterize an individual-based simulation model to predict how sexual selection can affect the probability of colonization of novel habitats under low versus high genetic diversity, and to generate predictions about the evolutionary dynamics during range expansion.'",0,0
746,92242,No,"Climate change, Environmental contaminants and Reproductive health","The research project investigates the possible impact of global climate change on reproductive health in one Arctic and two European populations. The key questions to be addressed are, firstly, how may climate change influence human exposure to widespread environmental contaminants and, secondly, how may contaminants impact occurrence of reproductive disorders as sensitive indicators of health? To provide affirmative answers to these questions the proposal will as a first step identify and describe mechanisms by which a changing climate may affect the exposure of Arctic and other human populations to contaminants through change in chemical use and emissions, delivery to the arctic ecosystem as well as processing within the arctic physical environment and human food chain. This work relies on modelling of existing data. Secondly, the project will expand the existing knowledge database on human exposure to polybrominated biphenylethers, perfluorinated surfactants and phthalates by analyses of 1000 biobanked serum samples collected in a EU FP5 project. Thirdly, the project will increase the limited knowledge on links between human exposure to contaminants and reproductive health. This work relies on a large existing parent-child-cohort, where a follow-up survey provide new data that are fed into risk assessment. Furthermore we will perform reviews of experimental and epidemiological literature to identify critical reproductive effects and exposure-response data for selected compounds as input to the risk assessment. Finally the project will integrate data on climate induced changes in contaminant mobility and distribution and links between contaminant exposure and reproductive health into a risk evaluation providing insight into possible future risk scenarios related to global climate change. The project draws upon a network of experts in climate modelling and in experimental, epidemiological and risk assessment methodologies and builds upon three established cohorts in Greenland, Poland and Ukraine.",0,0

The project aim is to investigate how Early Bronze Age  (2700-2200 BC) mortuary practices shaped, and were shaped by, emerging regional trade networks and the establishment and negotiation of community identities in the Apuseni mountain region of Romania. The research objectives are: 1) To understand the social factors that made individuals eligible for kinds of mortuary treatment, to ascertain whether eligibility for burial was affected by aspects of social identity; 2) To investigate the intersection of social and bioarchaeological inequalities, and 3) To reconstruct community social interactions. These objectives will be achieved by providing training for the EF in 1) osteobiographical and 2)  isotopic analyses, while collecting and analyzing osteoarchaeological data from the site of Rameț-Gugului. MARBAL will contribute to our understanding of the ways in which mortuary practices can be used to shape community and individual identities and dampen or enhance living social inequalities. It will take place at the University of Cambridge where relevant scientific, regional and period specialisms abound.",0,0
396,26931,No,An intervention to reduce inequities and barriers in access to health services for mothers and their children in rural Guatemala,"This proposal is a continuation of a study financed by the STD programme: Health seeking behaviour of mothers in rural Guatemala prior to the death of a child, and its relation to childhood mortality. The data collected enables us to propose interventions, which should be implemented and evaluated during the next phase of the project. We focused in the beginning on the health seeking behaviour of indigenas women. We found that the mothers generally used modern drugs for treatment of their children, but they used the formal health sector very little. In another study, where we compared indigenas and ladino communities, we found that more ladino mothers used the formal health sector (hospital) for delivery, and they also brought their sick children more frequently to the hospital than the indigenas mothers. It is a premise for this proposal that mothers in indigenas communities have at least as high, but not expressed, demand for services in the formal health sector for childhood diseases and delivery, as the current actual use of services by mothers in ladino communities. Interventions, proposed in this application, aim at reducing inequities and barriers in access to health services bY addressing both the problems of quality of care and attitudes of the personnel in the formal health sector, and the beliefs, fears and possible misconceptions among the mothers. The central methodology for the interventions uses video recording as a tool. The methodology has been developed by the health education unit at CEISAR. However, it must be emphasized that video recording is only a tool. It will be used in combination with other methodologies to explore the determinants of under-utilization, and to design, implement and evaluate interventions that will correct it. We will use an array of approaches a.o. 1. small scale community surveys to collect population based coverage and utilization data. 2. structured interviews and 'exit-surveys' (women leaving hospital) to measyre patient satiseaction, awareness and understanding; 3. participant observation of patient-provider interaction to assess the quality and patient centeredness of the interaction; 4. assessment of sentinel events and case audits of avoidable mortality, and patient management failures to track back the causes and propose remedies, 5. quality circles to stimulate changes in staff attitude and performance- Video recording will be used in these contexts when it is appropriate.",1,0
989,199971,No,Epigenetic Risk Assesment of Assisted Reproductive Technologies,"Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) are developing rapidly to provide response to infertility and to the cultural shift to postpone parenthood. Later childbearing and ART has been associated with an increased risk of the epigenetic disorders in offspring. Thus, in order to guarantee better and safer healthcare for EU citizens, risks and benefits of the use of various ART procedures needs to be thoughtfully tested. The project aims at overcoming the existing gaps and strengthening our capacity in Epigenetic Risk Assessment of Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ERA of ART). Long term GOAL of our project is to become the European Centre of Excellence and Innovation for Epigenetic Risk Assessment of ART. To do this, we will create link between IGAB PAS, providing high quality know-how in mouse embryology with University of Wuerzburg (leader in epigenetic assessment of ART embryos), with University of Teramo (having long-standing expertise in wide range of ART procedures in large animals) and with Uniwersytet Jagiellonski (having  long-standing expertise in human genetics). This twinning project will provide technological platform and expertise for epigenetic analyses and ART in large and small animal models. The specific aims of our project based on SWOT analysis are: 1) to enhance the scientific and technical skills of our staff; 2) stimulate preparation of joint research projects; 3) produce high impact factor publications and; 4) establish the cooperation with infertility clinics. The expected impact of this project is the creation of European Reference Network for ART safety evaluation, which is within the priorities of The Third Health Programme 2014-2020 of EC as well as within thematic area: HEALTHY SOCIETY of National Smart Specializations. This will have positive impact on the research in reproductive medicine and ART sector in general and will create a unique opportunity for Polish institution to become the reference Centre for knowledge-based decision making while preparing ART legislation.",0,0
716,42600,No,Dynamics of parent-offspring communication in the black-headed gull - an experimental and theoretical analysis,"Research objectives and content  The aim of this project is to study the development of begging behaviour in the black headed gull (Larus ridibundus), with particular emphasis on its consequences for resource allocation, and to integrate these results into evolutionary models of signalling. The research will be integrated in --and profit from-- an ongoing research project on behavioural ontogeny in this species at the University of Groningen (Dr. Groothuis). In the field we will study the effect of food deprivation on begging intensity, parental provisioning and resource allocation. To investigate the possible role of sibling rivalry in parent-offspring communication, we will manipulate the intensity of scramble competition using testosterone injections, which increase fighting and diminish begging intensity. We will measure the metabolic cost associated with chick begging and parental provisioning with doubly-labelled water. In the laboratory we will measure the effect of begging on chick growth and the plasticity of communication strategies, as well as the possibility of modifying them by learning, using experimental-psychology techniques. The black-headed gull constitutes an ideal species for this study because chicks are abundant, are easily reared in captivity and their extended nestling period facilitates the realisation of learning experiments, with prolonged training and testing phases.  I will develop dynamic game-theoretical models of parent-offspring communication incorporating the results of the ontogenetical study and the effects of sibling aggression.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The project encompasses theoretical work, experimental field work and lab studies in close collaboration with renowned experts in all fields, aiming at the integration of my multi-disciplinary experience and qualities and the rapprochement of experimental and theoretical biology.",0,0
909,96445,No,"Sociological identification of the actors, practices, discourses and technologies involved in the conservation of media-art works","The increasing engagement of artists with film, video, computers and the internet, has enabled the emergence of an unprecedented variety of ‘media-art’ forms, such as video-art, audio-visual installations, multimedia art, digital-art or net-art. However, the dependence of these media-art works on rapidly evolving technologies makes these works one of the most fragile parts of our contemporary artistic heritage. This research proposes a pioneering sociological investigation on media-art conservation practices. Its main objective is to identify the networks of technologies, practices, discourses and actors involved in the preservation of media-art works These objectives will be met by undertaking advanced training at New York University’s Sociology Department (USA) and by conducting an ethnographic study of media-art conservation practices at the Museum of Modern Art of New York (MoMA). This investigation will be transferred to the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (CRESC) at The Open University (UK), where it will contribute to establish a new line of research on the material dimensions of culture. The results of the study will be of great significance for both museum professionals in charge of the conservation of media-art collections and for cultural sociologists dealing with the processes of cultural preservation.

1000,98652,No,The effect of functionally targeted optical stimulation on visual perception,"Understanding how neural activity corresponds to visual perception has been a milestone question in neuroscience research. Traditionally this question has been addressed using a ‘correlative’ approach, i.e. by correlating neural activity with different perceptual states or different sensory conditions. Although many studies have shed light on how perception corresponds to neural activity, a causal relationship between the occurrence of particular neural events and the perception of sensory stimuli has yet to be established. In this project we aim to answer this question by using recently developed genetic tools for remote control of neuronal firing that now permit the detailed investigation of how neural activity influences behavior. Specifically, we propose to use two-photon calcium imaging to recognize single neurons with particular functional properties in mouse visual cortex and accurately identify their location within the network. Subsequently, we will use this information to transfect these neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 (Chr2) using single cell electroporation. Chr2 is a light gated ion channel, which enables precise triggering of action potential firing by flashes of blue light. We will then test the influence of induced action potentials in this functionally defined subset of neurons on visual detection performance of mice. This approach will enable us to determine how many and which neurons are important for visual performance and assess their contribution to visual perception.",0,0
77,219058,Yes,GRant AllocatioN Disparities from a gender perspective,"In the GRANteD project we study the occurrence and causes of gender bias in the allocation of research grants, We also study the consequences of gender bias in grant allocation for gender bias in the development of careers in research and innovation.  Our approach is distinct, because we (i) do not take every gender gap or different success rate as bias, but develop a model that includes variables such as past performance of the applicant and quality of the proposal that may influence the grant allocation. Then (ii) after controlling for the relevant variables we test whether gender has an effect on the grant allocation outcomes, that is gender bias. After in this way having determined where gender bias occurs in grant allocation, we (iii) identify the causes of gender bias, which may be in the procedures, in the criteria deployed, in the evaluation processes, or in composition of the panels, and result in e.g. gender stereotyping or in gendered application of criteria. Finally we analyse (iv) the effects of (biased) grant allocation on careers, but also vice versa, as career level of applicants may recursively influence grant allocation.  In order to generate results that can be generalised, the analysis covers a heterogeneous set of funding organizations and funding instruments. For several cases data are already available, for others new data will be collected. A series of methods will be used, from interviews and observations to qualitative text analysis,  quantitative multi-level analysis and event history analysis.

927,95105,No,Forced labour: an Afro-European heritage in sub-Saharan Africa (1930-1975)?,"This project analyses the structures of colonial systems of forced labour, in an attempt to come to a comparison of the different trajectories of African populations under distinct European administrations. Through the interpretation of case studies from different West African and Central African territories, it will be possible to understand the techniques of organising an involuntary labour force, and their evolution until and beyond independence. The slow process of the abolition of forced labour from World War II did not exclude continuities in clandestine practices of forcing African (rural) populations to work without remuneration. Another form of continuity connects colonial practices to the postcolonial re-institution of systems of forced labour: many postcolonial African governments were inclined to rely themselves on respective practices under the impression of dire budgetary situations. The different case studies will highlight the existence of forced labour as an Afro-European heritage in the social structures of African societies, and link that heritage back to the experiences of African populations in the local arena. For cases from Ghana, Senegal, São Tomé e Príncipe, and a larger Central African region consisting of sub-cases from Angola, Gabon, and Zambia, the project will address the question how structures of and changes in forced labour had an impact on relations of power inside of the local societies. In particular, forced labour was, in the colonial period, not only a means for colonial officials to shape socio-economic realities in the colonies according to their ideas, but it also was an instrument in the hands of chiefs ( traditional rulers ) who were eager to employ it as a weapon to discipline any existing opposition among their populations. African voices, both from archival sources and from interviews, will be in the focus of this analysis: they will show the importance of the particular experience of forced labour for African social evolution",0,0
215,90230,No,Long-term synaptic plasticity in interneurons: mechanisms and computational significance,"Memory encoding occurs by strengthening or weakening of synapses among principal neurons. However, excitatory synapses on some inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus also exhibit use-dependent long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), with important consequences for network homeostasis and information processing. This proposal addresses the following areas: 1. Although the rules determining which forms of plasticity occur at which synapses are emerging in the hippocampus, relatively little is known in other parts of the brain involved in cognition, movement initiation and emotion. We will use electrophysiology, optical imaging and mouse genetics to map out the expression of activity-dependent plasticity at excitatory synapses on inhibitory neurons in the cortex, striatum and amygdala, and relate these to the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the neurons and synapses involved. 2. Although one form of interneuron LTP resembles plasticity in pyramidal neurons, another form requires Ca2\-permeable AMPA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors for its induction, and shows features suggestive of pre-synaptic expression. A similar dichotomy exists in two forms of LTD, which depend on either NMDA or Ca2\-permeable AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors. We will test the involvement of candidate intracellular and trans-synaptic signalling cascades to understand the mechanisms triggered by distinct conjunction patterns of pre- and post-synaptic activity. 3. What is the computational significance of LTP and LTD in interneurons? The elemental computational roles of different GABAergic interneurons and their firing patterns during behaviourally relevant brain states are beginning to emerge. How synaptic strengthening and/or weakening interact with these network functions is however poorly understood. We will address this through a combination of hypothesis-driven experiments and numerical simulations.",0,0
342,98864,No,"Greek Women and Death, ancient and modern: A comparative Analysis","'To do the project, a training period in Greece is essential, which will also add scientific competencies to my career. The central theme of the project is women's role in connection with death-cult in ancient and modern Greece. The research is based on studies in ancient history combined with ethnographic fieldwork in modern Greece. Assuming that death-rituals have a focal and lasting importance, and are reflecting the gender relations within a society, the institutions surrounding death may function as a critical vantage point from which to view society. The comparison will be based on religious festivals, which are dedicated to deceased persons and on other death-rituals. Using laments, burials and the ensuing memorial rituals, the study will analyse the relationship between the death-cult dedicated to deceased mediators in ancient and modern society. I assume that the official ideological rituals are influenced by the domestic rituals people perform for their own dead, and vice versa, that the modern domestic rituals reflect the public performances. As this cult has many parallels with the ancient official cult, the question will be: Can an analysis of the modern public and domestic rituals in combination with ancient sources tell us more about the ancient death-cult? What can such an analysis tell us about the relationship between the domestic death-cult and the official? Since the practical performance of the domestic rituals is and probably was in the hands of women, it is crucial to discover what their influence is and was and hence, to illuminate the real power relations between women and men. Thus, this project offers a new contribution to earlier presentations of the Greek 'reality', but mainly from the female perspective, which is significant since men produced most of the ancient sources. Therefore, the project has an approach of great importance for the study of Ancient and Modern Greek Culture, Comparative Cultural Studies and Gender Research.'",1,0

403,186800,No,Erk1/2 SIGNALING IN MEMORY CONSOLIDATION AND ALLOCATION,"The growing aging population of the EU predicts a steady increase in the health and economic burden of mental decline. Hence, the study of the molecular basis of long-term memory formation is a central topic in neuroscience with forseeable social implications. The Erk1/2 MAPK signaling pathway has been strongly implicated in the consolidation of episodic, hippocampus-dependent memories, and it also supports lasting forms of neuroplasticity. However, knowledge on neuronal Erk1/2 signaling is largely limited to mechanisms of activation. If left unchecked, Erk1/2 activation can be detrimental to cognition. It is therefore crucial to understand what intracellular processes rapidly inactivate Erk1/2 following stimulation by synaptic activity, and how they contribute to memory endurance and precision. Furthermore, although Erk1/2 couples to CREB activation, the role of CREB-mediated transcription in memory allocation is poorly defined. It is also not known how the multiple synaptic inputs innervating the hippocampus support memory-associated MAPK signaling. I propose to implement a multidisciplinary approach that will experimentally address these related gaps. We will explore novel forms of Erk1/2 regulation, from the role of tyrosine phosphatases to afferent neural projections and cellular ensembles. To achieve these goals, we will use a combination of transgenic mice, viral vectors for opto- and chemo-genetics, behavioral assays, biochemistry, and confocal imaging. These studies will yield basic insights into molecular mechanisms of memory and hippocampal physiology.",0,0
277,187859,No,The Repeatability of Genetic Architecture,"A major challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand how genetic variation is created and maintained. Recent studies confirm the old idea introduced by Anderson in the 1940’s in his monograph “introgressive hybridisation”, namely that hybridisation can provide a bridge for the genetic exchange of adaptations (genes that increase fitness). In general, it is thought that adaptive genes have a greater chance to cross species boundaries than key “speciation genes” or “genomics islands of divergence” which are should be more resistant to introgression. An exciting opportunity to tackle this question is to study novel genetic combinations in recently originated hybrid zones, because they allow to study the creation and maintenance of unique genetic combinations within ecological time frames. In the last five years, the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and the computational advancements of new techniques to analyse big data (such as large sub-sections of the genome) allows testing these ideas for the first time in unprecedented detail. Temperature induced range expansion can cause novel range overlap between formerly allopatric species and can lead to extensive hybridisation in these new sympatric areas. In the proposed Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship, I will work with two closely related damselfly species Ischnura elegans and I. graellsii which show extensive and recent population overlap in southern Europe with strong and on-going hybridisation. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive genes have a greater chance to cross species boundaries than key speciation genes. To test this hypothesis, this proposal has three main objectives that address key challenges in the field: i) detailed quantification of introgression levels across the genome; ii) repeatability of the genetic architecture of speciation; and iii) repeatability of the genetic architecture of adaptation via introgressive hybridisation.",0,0
785,59282,No,Migration and New European Identities between Social Integration and Social Exclusion,"In the present phase, in all European countries and areas interested by migratory processes (of both old and new migration), phenomenons of increasing changes both in social and cultural life and in labour markets structures are registred. Consequently, there is an urgent need of a critical, substantial revision of interpretative patterns and approaches produced in the past (even recent), in migratory studies. In other words, the entire scientific production in this field in the last fifty years should become object of research itself, starting from its own multidisciplinarity in the training of young researchers. The in-depth study of basic processes of social transformation is a basis both to research-action and technological research. The European political context has also changed, affecting migratory policies. The new geographic and symbolic European Union identity - as it seems to emerge by the Maastricht Treaty and the Schengen Accord texts- has moved its own frontieers towards peripheral countries, which find themselves obliged to manage border, reception and integration politics in front of the pressure of migratory flows (this need will grow, as integration augments amongst State members of the Union). These countries migratory experience (as receiving countries) is recent and has developed in a contradictory manner, both in migratory policies and social practices in front of immigrants. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-1999-00161-2.pdf",0,0
456,75305,No,FIRST EUROPEAN MEETING ON MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR COGNITION,"Molecular and Cellular Cognition is a rapidly moving field which is at the crossroads between basic neurobiology and clinical neuroscience. At the end of 2002 a new scientific organisation, the Molecular and Cellular Cognition Society (MCCS, www.molcellcog.org), was established with the aim of facilitating exchanges between laboratories in this research field and to promote neuroscience at the general public level. Here, we propose to organise the first European Meeting, as a satellite of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies (FENS) meeting, to be held in Lisbon on July 8-9, 2004. This meeting will be organised by three prominent European scientists in this field, Seth Grant (University of Edinburgh, UK), Isabelle Mansuy (University of Zurich, Switzerland) and Riccardo Brambilla (San Raffaele Research Institute, Italy) in collaboration with the President of MCCS, Alcino Silva (UCLA, USA). Three additional members of the MCCS council will also be consulted for the organisation of the meeting: Paul Chapman (Merck, UK), Yadin Dudai (Weizmann Institute, Israel) and Cristina Alberini (Mount Sinai, USA). The meeting, which will be extensively advertised on both MCCS and FENS web sites and on the most important neuroscience journals, will be held in two days. On day 1, the first oral presentation session will be followed in the afternoon by a single poster session. On day 2, two oral presentation sessions will be scheduled, for a total of approximately 30 speakers, 100 posters and 300 participants. In addition to invited speakers coming from Europe, Japan and USA, approximately one third of the oral presentation will be selected from posters. Particular attention is made to women and to scientists coming from Eastern Europe. The meeting will also be an ideal forum for fostering interactions between scientists in industrial and clinical research, who are encouraged to apply.",0,0
1007,88451,No,Contaminant mixtures and human reproductive health - novel strategies for health impact and risk assessment of endocrine disrupters,"Disruption of hormonal signalling in fetal life can irreversibly affect human development and reproductive health at a later age. Of considerable concern in Europe is a decline in male semen quality and a high prevalence of congenital malformations and hormone-dependent cancers. Although it appears plausible that environmental chemicals with endocrine activity may be involved in the causation of these disorders, there is no evidence for adverse effects of individual substances at relevant human exposure levels. However, there are indications that combinations of chemicals play a cumulative role. CONTAMED aims to explore the hypothesis that combined exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals in fetal life may lead to adverse delayed impacts on human reproductive health. To achieve this goal, CONTAMED will combine epidemiological approaches with laboratory science. The work plan for CONTAMED is organised in three major strands focusing on human studies, animal models and in vitro assays including metabolomics. The project will deliver new epidemiological insights into associations between cumulative exposure and reproductive health, improved toxicological risk assessment for the anticipation of reproductive effects of chemicals, validated biomarkers for cumulative exposures and new mechanistic information about the ways in which chemicals may disrupt sexual differentiation during development. CONTAMED will provide the knowledge necessary to set the scene for Europe-wide human health impact studies of cumulative exposures to endocrine active chemicals and their possible role in the deterioration of reproductive health in Europe. Finally, the project will analyze the implications of new scientific findings for the European Environment and Health Action Plan and the Community Strategy for Endocrine Disrupters.",0,0
124,90198,Yes,Higher Education Leading to ENgineering And scientific careers,"Women participation in engineering occupations appears as a key-issue for European economical and technical development, as well as a central achievement towards gender equality and social justice.  Many studies have identified gender-mainstreaming measures in engineering education; for example, the WOMENG project (HPSE-CT-2002-00109) has recently highlighted key-moments for action and recommendations. Yet, other studies have confirmed that successfully implementing such measures requires in each case a tailor-made overall approach to take into account the specific cultural and economical context in which they must be implemented.  The aim of this project is to provide indications about how to launch such measures and monitor the obtained results. The study will be grounded on empirical research about the implementation of selected gender mainstreaming measures in various pilot institutions of engineering education and research all over Europe, including institutions for continuing education and distance learning. After analysing the existing situation, each institution will choose the measures that seem the most realistic and appropriate to its particular case, while implemented measures will have to privilege a global approach from engineering education institutions. They will be intended at the same time for students, faculty and staff and consider transitions from secondary education to higher education and from higher education to academic and industrial professional spheres.",0,1
976,97273,No,Impacts of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and Enhancing Carbon Stocks,"At COP15 in Copenhagen one outcome was a commitment to develop a mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing carbon stocks (REDD\). There is, however, only a limited research basis for such a mechanism particularly with regard to the need for understanding and monitoring the impact of REDD\ activities on climate effectiveness, cost efficiency, equity and co-benefits. I-REDD\ will approach these challenges from a truly interdisciplinary perspective. The overall objective will be to obtain an improved understanding of how the implementation of REDD\ mechanisms may 1) reduce emissions of GHG and maintain or enhance existing stocks of carbon in vegetation and soil of various land cover types; 2) impact livelihoods and welfare of local farming communities and differences between communities; 3) impact biodiversity conservation, and 4) provide a realistic framework for monitoring, reporting and verification of REDD\, including the importance of governance and accountability at multiple levels. To complement other research initiatives we propose to work in the uplands of Southeast Asia in the ‘Heart of Borneo’, Kalimantan, Indonesia, and in the northern parts of Lao PDR and Vietnam, and Yunnan in Southwest China. Rapid land use transitions from forest and shifting cultivation to other, more intensive land use systems and widespread forest degradation are occurring in these areas, making the potential for REDD\ particularly pronounced. Moreover, REDD\ may considerably impact on local economies, because of the high population densities in the region. The partners in I-REDD\ are leading research institutions in Europe and Southeast Asia, international research organizations, an NGO and an SME. The consortium has a strong emphasis on local dissemination and capacity development in order to ensure that project results influence REDD\ policy development at local, national and global level.",0,0
18,107192,Yes,Disputing gender. Understanding how psychological gender research is used in public scientific controversies on gender in US-American media,"The proposed transdisciplinary project analyzes socioscientific controversies on gender in US-American media. The notion socioscientific controversy entails public debates in which social questions are debated with the help of science. This project focuses on public debates about gender relations in which participants draw on psychological gender research. The analysis starts with a controversy sparked when in 2005, the president of Harvard University suggested that the lack of woman scientists in higher scientific positions might be due to innate cognitive gender differences. The following public debate included psychologists who used psychological gender research to either confirm or reject this position. The project will draw on discourse analysis to analyze this public debate and similar socioscientific controversies in selected US-American media. Research questions are directed at the ways in which psychological gender research shapes what can be publicly said about gender. Context information is drawn on to clarify the relation between public scientific discourse on gender and factual gender inequalities. Results will be discussed in the light of the critical historiography of psychology, science studies approaches on public scientific controversies, and feminist reflections on the interpenetration of science and gender inequalities. The project aims to contribute both theoretically and empirically to a critical historiography of psychology by analyzing and defining the relation between psychology and social inequalities, to science studies approaches on socioscientific controversies by clarifying how socioscientific controversies mediate between scientific and public discourse, and to feminist studies on the relation between science and social inequalities with an exemplary analysis and a detailed reflection of the interpenetration between psychological gender research and gender inequalities.",1,1
62,105271,Yes,"European Union Conditionality, Labour Law, and Women in Employment: The Case of Turkey","The European Union considers the labour law framework as one of the fundamental parameters for the creation of jobs and a gender equal labour market, both of which foster European economic growth and social cohesion. The European Union has introduced a substantial body of equal treatment legislation promoting equality of opportunity. However, there is a need for empirical data generated in the course of sociological research to measure the practical impact of legal rules on different working women by recognizing the social realities of a particular country. The proposed research addresses the impact of gender-related legislation on working women for the first time in the context of a candidate country to the European Union. It looks at the role of labour law and European Union conditionality might play in advancing an ‘equality’ agenda in support of a labour market which is fairer and more inclusive by taking the case of Turkey. The major question focused in this research is: How and in what ways the Labour Act of Turkey, which was improved to conform to the European Union standards, influence the family and work lives of blue-collar and white-collar Turkish women in employment by enabling or inhibiting women to enter and/or stay in the labour market. The research entails a unique threefold analysis of (i) policy addressing gender equality in employment; (ii) experiences of working women who are the subject of that policy; and (iii) consultations with a number of Civil Society Organisations to provide accountability for policy implementation. It also aims at opening a new equality agenda item in the European Union and Turkey on how labour law can progress to support  EU 2020-Europe’s Growth Strategy's objective of achieving growth with more women working, as well as principles highlighted in the Copenhagen Declaration. The European policy research will benefit highly from a research proposal that constitutes an advanced theoretical and empirical study of this topic.",1,1
833,83232,No,Health effects of retirement,"What are the health effects of the act of retiring? While this is an important question with pertinent policy consequences, little is currently known about the answer. The notion that retirement harms health is an old, and persistent hypothesis. (See Minkler 1981 for a review.)  Others believe that retirement is a health-preserving life change (Eckart et al, 1983b). Despite the long-standing debate, there is little conclusive evidence thus far. The question is much more difficult to answer than would appear at first glance. The inherent problem is that retirement is often a choice, and may or may not be based on health characteristics before retirement.  An additional complication to the research is that the health effects of retirement may offset each other. In order to properly address this question, one needs to find an instrument that is related to retirement behaviour, but uncorrelated with health. Further, since the discussion about raising the retirement age is an international one, to adequately address the issue, work should be completed on an international context.  Two research projects, in two different country settings, will help answer this question. - The first project is in an American context, where the offering of early retirement windows in the US will be used as an instrument for retirement. - The second project will use changes in the Disability Insurance law, and changes in the retirement ages of the occupational defined benefit retirement plans as instruments for retirement behaviour in the Netherlands.  By carefully selecting instruments that are not correlated with health outcomes and do determine retirement behaviour, and using mean IV and median IV regression techniques, any causal relationship between retirement behaviour and health outcomes will be measured.",0,0
301,192055,No,Origins and Effects of Normative Commitments,"A debate in the development of legal institutions is whether individuals obey the law because the law incentivizes or because the law has legitimacy.  Much of the PI’s research in law and in development seeks to understand how people form normative commitments, i.e., what people view as the moral and right thing to do, and how they respond to these normative commitments.  His work traces the incentives that lead to human rights violations.  The PI has examined how interpretations of religious and legal texts, particularly those associated with fundamentalism, interact with market forces.  In two multi-part studies, the PI investigated the economic forces underlying the religious provision of social insurance, social sanctions, social conservatism, and the economic incentives that give rise to gender violence, sexual harassment, and regulation of the private domain.  Through these investigations, the PI formulated a theory for why church-state separation arose in some countries but not in others, developed a methodology for empirically evaluating the effects of normative commitments, and used a particular instance of interpretive injustice where capital cases in the British Army during World War I were randomly executed or commuted, in order to estimate the deterrent and delegitimizing effects of the death penalty. The proposed project builds on this previous work. The proposal rests on 2 pillars: Normative Commitments in Health Care and Normative Commitments in Courts.  Within these 2 pillars, the PI studies the effects of market forces on normative commitments and examines how normative commitments come into existence in the first place.  (1) Normative Commitments in Health Care: The PI will measure the influence of pharmaceutical company payments to physicians on their normative commitments. This pillar will evaluate the effects of payments on physician prescriptions and patient outcomes. The pillar will examine whether disclosure laws affect the relationship between payments, prescriptions, and patient outcomes. The pillar will employ a unique U.S. dataset on over 2 billion prescription claims per year on up to 177 million individuals and a Danish database of all prescription drugs sold linked to prescribers with pharmaceutical associations. (2) Normative Commitments in Courts: This pillar will use the random assignment of judges in common law courts to measure the impact of exogenous changes in legal precedent. The pillar will apply a method co-developed by the PI for two-stage least squares estimation (Econometrica (80(6), 2369-2429, 2012) that exploits judicial characteristics as instrumental variables. The pillar will study the effects of 24 legal areas, including capital punishment, free speech, gay rights, gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and rights of the disabled.  The pillar will use this data to study the origin of rights.",0,0
881,109022,No,Developmental trajectories for model-free and model-based reinforcement learning: computational and neural bases,"Adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological changes of puberty and ends at the time at which the individual attains a stable, independent role in society. During this period, decisions are characterized by being impulsive and high-risk, and this can have serious consequences, for example accidents caused by dangerous driving and experimentation with alcohol and drugs. It is thus important to understand the neurocognitive processes that underlie decision-making in adolescence. Decision-making depends on the interaction of several component processes, including the representation of value, response selection and learning. In reinforcement learning all these processes are integrated. Reinforcement learning deals with the ability of learning to improve one’s future choices in order to maximize the occurrence of pleasant events (rewards) and minimize the occurrence of unpleasant events (punishments). Theoretical models for reinforcement learning postulate the existence of a dual controller for action selection: ‘Model-free’, which is computationally simple, more reflexive and inflexible and ‘Model-based’, which is more reflective and flexible, but computationally complex. The development of reinforcement learning in human adolescence has been studied only recently. Studies to date have not attempted to disentangle model-free and model-based behaviour. The aims of the current project are: i. to map the development of reinforcement learning systems – via behavioural/computational analysis - and ii. to relate the maturation of model-based reinforcement learning to the functional maturation of specific neural circuits – via functional magnetic resonance experiment. This study will provide further insights in adolescent reward-based decision-making and its neural bases, within the theoretical framework of reinforcement learning.",0,0
100,81259,Yes,Survey of the University Career of Female Scientists at Life Sciences versus Technical Universities,"The aim of the project is to carry out an innovative pilot survey to enhance existing knowledge on career patterns of female scientists at universities. The project will open up new perspectives for further in-depth work in the field by mapping the situation of female researchers in engineering and life sciences in seven universities in six countries in Europe with special regard to gender differences in research careers, critical areas where women are underrepresented, leading university positions, access to funding, mobility and work-life balance. Women face great difficulties in developing professional careers in equal opportunities to those of men in these sectors, especially regarding their proportion and representation at the higher levels of the hierarchical ladder.  The project will examine and compare the situation of female researchers and decision makers. A methodology to map careers in university will be designed and tested in the partner institutions. The survey will involve PhD students, researchers and decision makers as well. Besides the collection of detailed statistics - which is missing at almost all involved universities - the consortium will conduct interviews with those female researchers who succeeded in doing a career in these areas of science in spite of the difficulties. The project will map not only the good practices but the bad ones as well in order to determine how the career of female researchers is set back in these areas.  Furthermore it is one of the objectives of the project to draw the attention of the university managements to the importance of ensuring equal opportunities to women and men and the practice of gender mainstreaming as a policy of the European Union. The partner countries include two new member states (Hungary and Estonia), three old member states (Austria, Finland and Italy) and a candidate country (Turkey), so they provide an ideal coverage of circumstances available throughout Europe.",1,1
294,196786,No,Genetic Mapping of Evolutionary Developmental Variation using Hybrid Mouse in vitro Crosses,"Discovering the genetic changes underlying species differences is a central goal in evolutionary genetics. Most evolutionarily important traits affecting fitness are complex or quantitative traits, whose genetic bases are elusive. In mammals, dissecting the genetic basis of complex trait variation is particularly challenging, because efficient genetic mapping requires enormous pedigrees or specialized genetic panels that are typically beyond the resources of individual groups. Using a radically novel method to circumvent breeding limitations by “breeding” mice in vitro, I propose to dissect the genetic basis of evolutionary developmental variation. This ground-breaking approach will allow me to create large genetic mapping panels of potentially any size from mouse interspecific hybrids of increasing evolutionary divergence. In vitro crosses promise a breakthrough in evolutionary biology: by bypassing hybrid sterility and inviability, we will ask which genetic changes underlie species differences. The proposed experiments address how genetic changes accumulate during evolution of new species to shape gene regulatory networks and cause phenotypic changes at the gene expression, fitness and organismal level. This research has the potential to revolutionize genetic mapping. If realized, its impact on personalized medicine, agricultural science and evolutionary research cannot be understated.",0,0

The survey showed that a need exists for development and implementati European quality assurance computerized informations system in oral health care. practices seem primarily oriented towards treatment procedures and reimbursement practices, whereas there is room for improvement in recording and reporting oral assurance parameters. The survey showed the need, at all levels, for a system ba up approach.  A further report on the state of the art of European software prod care gave evidence that redesign of the knowledge base for oral health care info is of paramount importance. There is no general platform upon which quality assu could be implemented, and any approach to implementing quality standards in oral computerized information system development should start with the definition of platform.

536,95166,No,Antigen processing and T cell recognition of intravacuolar parasites,"Antigen recognition by CD8 T cells enables us to combat infectious pathogens, such as viruses and parasites. This feature represents the groundwork for vaccine efficacy. Immune surveillance is achieved by screening short peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. Recognition of foreign peptide-MHC I complexes triggers cytokine production and cytotoxicity towards the infected target. CD8 T cells are key for protection against intravacuolar parasites, likes the malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum and a closely related parasite : Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). T. gondii infection can cause life-threatening encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals and severe birth defects if pregnant women get primo-infected. Yet, how the parasite antigens are degraded by the MHC I pathway and how it leads to ultimate establishment of protective CD8 T cells is poorly characterized. Here, using tools and findings obtained during my post-doctoral training in the USA, I propose to use the genetically tractable T. gondii parasites as a model to study T cell immunity to intravacuolar parasites. First, I will address the mechanisms underlying cytosolic access and processing of T. gondii antigens (aim 1). Then we will study the potential strategies used by the parasites to evade CD8 T cell recognition (aim 2). As a longer-term development, we will examine the induction of parasite-specific intestinal T cells in vivo, following oral infection (aim 3). This proposal should have a fundamental significance by revealing novel pathways of antigen processing, as well as a clinical relevance by suggesting ways to manipulate antigen processing and lead to the creation of vaccines against toxoplasmosis. This project will be undertaken in the “Immunology and Infectious diseases” department of the CPTP-INSERM U563 research centre in Toulouse, France.",0,0

Globalisation and regional integration are considered as the major trends in the internationalisation of the world economy. The new behaviour imposes new rules of the game to all the participants in the economic process (companies, governments, managers, workers) in order to cope with the requirements of the increasing competitiveness. The conjunction of two trends arises specific and crucial challenges for the European Union. For the time being, the most important one is the enlargement of the EU to the CEE countries. This process demands a deep analysis of the foreseeable consequences for both set of countries (the EU members and the new-comer countries) in terms of life conditions, markets and institutions. Another critical arca of analysis is the EU institutional reform, required for the enlargement, in such important items as common budget, the CAP, the adaptation of EMU, the ways of representation in the European Parliament and Commission.

1018,98009,No,Family Matters: Intergenerational Influences on Fertility,"Why do people have children? Why do they have the number of children they do? These questions are of fundamental importance, but we do not yet have satisfactory answers. I propose to bring an interdisciplinary perspective, involving demography, evolutionary biology, anthropology and psychology, to bear on this topic. The aim is to test the hypothesis that intergenerational influences are important determinants of fertility, from fertility intentions to timing of births to number of children. The theoretical rationale derives from a hypothesis emerging from evolutionary biology that humans are  cooperative breeders : mothers need help from others to raise children, because human children are too costly for mothers to raise alone. The support of relatives, particularly intergenerational support, is thus vital to women in determining how many children they have. If so, there is a major gap in our understanding of fertility, since such influences have not been systematically studied. This aim will be achieved using rigorous, empirical methods to analyse data from all world regions, and to use novel methods for collecting new data on fertility. The key to this project is its holistic comparative nature. The ultimate goal will be a novel comparative analysis of data from the full gamut of human societies, from small-scale traditional societies through historical populations to contemporary nations surveyed through large-scale surveys. This will allow us to go beyond simply documenting kin influences, and to understand why particular kin matter under which circumstances. Such a comparative approach has not been used before but is vital if we are to fully understand why fertility varies. This will significantly advance understanding of fertility, and promote interdisciplinary research.",0,0
618,220330,No,Precision medicine in traumatic brain injury using individual neurosteroid response,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is very common and affects 1.8 million Europeans seeking medical help each year. TBI is a major challenge for healthcare providers and poses an enormous economic burden. For decades, TBI has been characterized by severity of symptoms for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, this classification system is limited since it does not allow to predict long-term outcome after TBI. This state of affairs thus hinders the advancement of TBI research and the development of therapies. The field is thus in dire need of a novel understanding and classification of the individual’s response to brain injury and, most importantly, a fresh perspective on potential targets for effective treatment and prevention of long-term impairment.    My main hypothesis is that brain injury leads to a neurosteroid response with inter-individual variability and that this response is associated with the trajectory of recovery. I further hypothesize, that the most vulnerable patient cohorts, such as adolescent girls, show distinct patterns of neurosteroid response associated with an increased risk for persistent symptoms.   NEUROPRECISE proposes a longitudinal cohort study 1) to characterize neurosteroid response with respect to age and sex in children and adolescents with TBI, 2) to evaluate the association of the neuroimaging derived individual injury profile with neurosteroid response, and 3) to explore individual differences in neurosteroid response as a potential target for acute therapy and prevention of chronic symptoms with respect to age and sex in a rodent model.  NEUROPRECISE will overcome a critical barrier towards the treatment of TBI by establishing a novel, biological-driven way to stratify TBI patients based on inter-individual differences in the response to TBI. By exploring the individual neurosteroid response as potential therapeutic target, NEUROPRECISE will bring the power of precision medicine to neurotrauma research.",0,0
818,185965,No,Epigenetics of Cnidarian Stem Cells,"Epigenetics is a new and exciting area in biomedical sciences. It studies mitotically heritable chemical modifications of chromatin that are not associated with changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic modifications (EMs) affect the expression of genes, and therefore the phenotype of cells. Current views suggest that epigenetics reinforces cell fate stability. Indeed, EMs are essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis, and improper regulation may result in diseases like cancer. Despite the relatively good understanding of the role of epigenetics in mammals and flies, many questions are still open. They include the origin and distribution of EMs in animals, and how differences in epigenetic control mediate different life strategies among taxa. In particular, it is possible that traits like regenerative ability, growth plasticity, senescence and resistance to malignancy, which are differentially distributed among animal groups, are primarily mediated by taxon-specific EMs. We propose to test this hypothesis by studying the role of epigenetics in stem cell fate determination in the cnidarian Hydractinia echinata, an animal model that occupies a phylogenetically pivotal position at the base of the animal kingdom, and is genetically tractable and susceptible to genetically manipulation. We will use a genome wide approach to map DNA methylation and histone modification sites in the Hydractinia genome. We will then analyze the specific utilization of EMs, comparing stem cells with terminally differentiated somatic cells. Finally, we will use gain and loss of function experiments to study the specific role of selected EM genes in different contexts in the Hydractinia life history. This project will provide insight into the mechanisms that mediates stem cell decision-making and why they are more versatile in basal invertebrates. Our results will impact not only such fields as evolutionary, cell and developmental biology, but also regenerative medicine and cancer.",0,0
548,3925,No,Methodology of economic appraisal of health technology,"The general aim of the project was to improve the range and quality of economic appraisals of health technology within the EC, with particular relevance to their usefulness to decision makers. The specific project objectives were:   (i) to improve the methodological quality of studies that are carried out, by outlining methodological standards and by assessing studies against these;  (ii) to help decision makers to appreciate the relevance of economic appraisal, to encourage them to use appraisal results and to commission or participate in further studies;  (iii) to increase the integration between economic appraisal and other components of health technology assessment, such as biomedical engineering, clinical research and assessments carried out by industry. Research was carried out in order to improve the range and quality of economic appraisals of health technology within the European Community (EC), with particular relevance to their usefulness to decision makers. The main activities comprised the establishment of a current awareness network (for economic appraisal of health technology in the EC), 3 subprojects on particular technologies (lasers in medicine, open heart surgery and prenatal screening), a study of the role of economic appraisal in developing policy for health technology and the production of handbooks for key decision makers.  It was found that significant progress had been made in the methodology and practice of economic appraisal of health technology in the EC, with approximately 100 studies completed, of which 20% had an impact on decision making. Several general methodological principles were established, although a number of specific methodological issues require further investigation. The Concerted Action greatly increased the understanding of the role of economic appraisal in developing policy for health technology. However, further efforts are required to forge closer links between economic evaluation and decision making about health technologies. In order to achieve the stated objectives, the project was organised in six main components:   (i) Establishment of a current awareness network (for economic appraisal of health technology) in the EC.  (ii) Sub-project on lasers in medicine (as an example of evolving health technology).  (iii) Sub-project on open heart surgery (as an example of synthesis of evidence about health technology).

307,75282,No,Identification of molecular pathways that regulate the organ-specific metastasis of breast cancer,"The objectives of this proposal are to identify genes, proteins and molecular pathways involved in regulating the metastasis of breast cancer to specific organs. To achieve these objectives we will use a combination of gene expression profiling, bioinformatic analysis, histology of human female breast cancer samples, genetic manipulation of transplantable tumour cells and transgenic mouse technology. In addition to finding new genes, we aim to analyse to what extent genes already known to play a role in breast cancer metastasis specify which organs breast tumours metastasise to. We will also establish how the currently known genes that are associated with breast cancer dissemination and the new ones we identify fit together into pathways that regulate organ- specific metastasis. These findings will be coupled with the analysis of clinical trials that participants in this consortium are involved in. Further deliverables include the development of improved animal models for the study of breast cancer metastasis, and the development of diagnostic methods for determining whether primary tumours already have metastatic potential. Together, the work packages in this proposal will establish a pipeline of activities that unite basic research into the organ-specific metastasis of breast cancer with target validation and clinical application.",0,0

By means of written reports and a database system, knowledge about mental health problems and the necessary mental health care will be available. In the first phase the principal question to be answered was whether a clear and uniform terminology could be reached with regard to mental health problems among deaf people and mental health care.  Using the Delphi method, 22 professionals in mental health care for deaf people and professionals familiar with the deaf and deaf culture held discussions together about this theme. The 3 main subjects discussed during the Delphi workshop were: mental health problems related to deafness; the use of the term 'surdophrenia'; deafness.  With regard to mental health problems related to deafness, the participants were in favour of linking as much as possible with the classification systems already existing. In this respect the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 was contemplated.  It was agreed upon that the term 'surdophrenia' should be abolished. An alternative term has been suggested and accepted. The way of defining deafness depends to a great extent on the purpose of the definition. It should be defined according to the context in which it is used. Therefore a multiaxial frame of factors has been presented, where 3 axes represent the following factors: medical factors, communication factors and psychosocial factors.  The first phase of the research project will serve as a basis for the preparation and carrying out of national surveys in Europe and the organizing of another Delphi workshop. The European Society for Mental Health and Deafness is primarily concerned with deaf people with serious communication difficulties - prelingually deaf and deaf people with additional handicaps such as deaf people who are also blind and deaf people with intellectual handicaps. However, the Society is conscious of the fact that persons with other degrees and types of deafness also require such specialised services.   Without the requisite expertise, including skills in manual methods of communication, mental health workers will be unable to diagnose or treat deaf people correctly. Often deaf people with poor speech are mistakenly thought to be mentally impaired. Mental illness or emotional disorder will not always be recognized or conversely will be mistakenly diagnosed when they are not present.   The most important aim of the Society is to help in the promotion of mental health care for deaf people in European countries, to improve existing services and to stimulate the creation of new services.   In order to achieve this, all knowledge about the problems under consideration will have to be compiled and inventoried. Based on this knowledge, it should become possible to design strategies to supply deaf people with the best possible mental health care facilities.",0,0
771,199019,No,Widening the Scientific Excellence for Studies on Women’s and Fetal Health and Wellbeing,"Given that one in six couples face infertility, often caused by female factors, women’s reproductive health is a significant medical and socio-economical challenge. Herein, while addressing this issue, the Estonian research on female reproductive health and medicine has rapidly developed with the lead of University of Tartu (UT). Nevertheless, the UT’s capacity and expertise still falls short of the leading institutions. At the same time, also the most competitive research groups face significant barriers to perform world-class science due to substantial networking gaps that still exist between previously non-linked research teams. TWINNING funding scheme is designed to overcome these aforementioned shortcomings. Thus UT has formed a WIDENLIFE consortium with its world-renowned partners: University of Oxford and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and altogether we have set two ambitious objectives to address. Firstly, for the UT: to become one of the leading research and teaching centres for reproductive and fetal medicine in Eastern and Northern Europe. Secondly, for all members of consortia: to intensify trilateral synergies between the research groups in the areas of female reproductive health and medicine. Our specific goals are to highlight the associations between female metabolic health and infertility, provide deeper understating for embryonal development, and offer new tools for infertility treatment and prenatal diagnostics. In order to resolve these objectives, exchange of know-how, ideas and information between the partners will be enhanced, creating the novel clinically valuable information through pooling the expertise and synergy of resources, interests and commitments by universities from Estonia, UK and Belgium. This could also mean a significant contribution to the scientific capacity of the Estonian research community as well as the health technology industry, which is one of the main focus areas for Estonian Smart Specialisation Strategy.",0,0
590,91291,No,Privacy Awareness Through Security Branding,"While it can be assumed that the security industry and organisations will increase their efforts to keep and to strengthen trust relations with citizens, the question however remains: how can one raise more awareness of social conflicts and privacy concerns among those public and private agencies that undermine privacy necessarily on a daily basis in their mission to provide security? PATS follows an approach known as Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA). One central attempt of it is to broaden the design process of new technologies through dialogue between innovators and the public so that developments meet social needs and mismatches, wrong investments, and possible social conflicts can be minimized. The aim of PATS is to increase privacy awareness across various sectors, from firms to government agencies focussing especially on the development and use of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and biometrics. On the basis of a socio-technical mapping the idea is to create security brand indicators that refer to the value of privacy. It is well known that neither laws nor other organizational practices can exclusively provide a reasonable level of protection for privacy today. There is some evidence that its protection may well be linked to higher levels of trust and that is a powerful motive for serious self-regulation. What is necessary is to build into the security agencies and actors itself a reflexive capacity that encourages more critical communication and awareness among the stakeholders. The overall objective of PATS is to demonstrate how certain standards of privacy can become a brand label for security organisations on a voluntary but binding basis. Using more reflexive measures such as open expert interviews, dialogue work shops, expert evaluations/focus groups and two major conferences PATS seeks to initiate not only an informed but a constructive debate between stakeholders in order to enable rather proactive than reactive for future policies.",0,0
598,220381,No,Role of Educational Systems on Entry Level Wage Differences,"The gender wage gap has narrowed from the 1960s, mainly due to the increase of female education, work experience and female workforce participation, however, it still remains. Across EU countries, in 2015 women earned on average 16.3% less than men, and this gap has only marginally declined from 18.6% in 2000 . In the US, women working full-time earn just 81.9% of men’s salaries in the same period.    The gender wage gap literature can be divided according to their findings at the entry level and along the career path. While the literature agrees that wages grow faster for men than for women throughout their careers, evidence of wage differences at the entry level is mixed. Conclusive evidence about the existence of early wage differences will improve our knowledge of how labor markets work, will help identify the sources of wage discrimination, and will guide policy decisions towards reducing gender differences along the career path. Despite their impact on early-career wage differences, countries’ distinct educational systems and ages of the studied cohorts have not been taken into account in earlier analyses.  The aims of this fellowship consist in (a) answering whether gender wage discrimination is present at early career stages, and (b) investigating the role of the educational systems on early wage discrimination. We will estimate the structural parameters of initial wages (intercepts) and their growth rate (slopes) for men and women considering the potential future investments in HC. Using some of the best longitudinal data sets currently available for the US (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth - NLSY) and Switzerland (Swiss Household Panel – SHP, and Longitudinal Analysis in the Field of Training - LABB), we will compare entry level wages and their evolution from two countries with different educational systems (VET and Academic Track).",1,0
2,214103,Yes,"Women’s movements and gestational surrogacy: engaging, debating and policy making","Gestational surrogacy (GS) is transnational practice of assisted reproduction increasingly undergone by European citizens in Member States and Third Countries. Women’s Movements (WMs), primary actors in  policies on human reproduction, understand GS either as a form of commodification of women and children, or as an empowering opportunity for women in poor countries. WMs are forging alliances with other stakeholders (LGBTQI, pro-life, and private actors) to influence decision makers to abolish or to regulate GS. WoMoGeS analyzes the ‘politics of signification’ on GS of WMs in 2 developed countries, US, and Italy, and 2 developing countries, India and Mexico, to reveal variety of diagnostic, prognostic and motivational frames, their policy demands and strategic alliances across different social contexts, and the interplay between discourses and policy making at country-level and transnationally. By carrying out a comparison of 4 context-specific case-studies and engaging WMs and GS stakeholders, this project aims to hinder the risk that GS activism reproduces the same polarizing dynamics as in the debate on prostitution, and the risk that WMs’ perspectives in developing countries, main providers of surrogate mothers, are silenced by more visible WMs in developed countries. WoMoGeS aims to promote dialogue between WMs and GS stakeholders, catalyze European policy making on GS that considers diversity of thought, and to propose mature reflections on assisted reproduction based on scientific information. Training and supervision by top experts on GS at UT and on WMs at LUMSA will enable me to continue skill development started during my PhD on WMs’ contribution to gender-related discourses, strengthen my ability to work across different fields of Sociology, and acquire new competences in Bioethics and comparative social analysis, with the goal to consolidate my profile as sociologist expert in gender studies and critical analysis of social movements' discourses.",1,1
138,75563,Yes,Promoting the integration of the gender dimension in basic research in ERA/FP7,"The objective of this activity is to ensure a better integration of the gender dimension in basic life sciences research. Integration of the gender dimension for life sciences and biomedical research consists of the consideration of both sex differences and differences resulting from gender. The activity of the proposed SSA specifically aims at supporting researchers in basic/preclinical research. The integration of the genderdimension, the expertise on the subject and awareness of the genderdimension still need improvement. Biological and socio-cultural differences between women and men may result in different epidemiological patterns and effect modification of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic interventions. Above that researchers in the life s ciences encouter a variety of problems concerning gender issues in their research. It is our purpose to develop practical tools to help the researchers to tackle the problems. Already developed good practices will be collected and disseminated. When appr opriate, new tools will be developed. An expert meeting will be organised in which experts in basic life sciences research as well as methodological experts and gender experts will be challenged to present problems they encounter and their solutions to t he issue. During the expert meeting these presentations will be discussed on the basis of realism and proportionality. The experts will be asked to cooperate to develop tools that are suited for the everyday research practice and will meet the goals as f ormulated in the science and society call FP6.",1,1
576,87729,No,Pursuing goals you really want: Motive congruence and well-being in Turkish immigrants,"'People all over the world feel unhappy or even depressed when their explicit goals are incongruent with their implicit needs. This discrepancy plays a crucial role especially during stressful life events that are typical for immigrants. The aim of our research project is to go beyond previous studies on acculturation and well-being by assessing potential discrepancies between explicit goals and implicit motives as 'hidden stressors' in the acculturation process of Turkish first- and second-generation immigrants. We draw upon recent findings in the areas of motivation, acculturation and identity to construct a model about immigrants’ subjective well-being. We propose that well-being is influenced by the alignment of implicit motives and explicit goals, which reflect relations between the private and public domain in acculturation. This relationship is mediated by the interaction of an individual’s acculturation orientation and identity status. Our research design consists of three studies that employ state-of-the-art methodology, including a multi-method approach, and a cross-sectional study, and a longitudinal study using cultural frame switching: We first test the general model (Study 1). Then, we experimentally investigate immigrants’ well-being in different cultural contexts (i.e., host culture/culture of origin; Study 2). Finally, we examine differences in well-being in varying cultural contexts within each person (Study 3). Our approach goes beyond self-reports and can shed light on why some acculturation strategies level may not work equally well for all individuals. Improving psychological assessment and counselling, our framework can build a basis for social intervention programs by shifting the focus to interindividual differences in immigrants so that steps, based on the individual case, can be taken to facilitate an individual’s endeavour of becoming a happy and adapted member of society.'",0,0
483,208309,No,"Re-fashioning the Renaissance: Popular Groups, Fashion and the Material and Cultural Significance of Clothing in Europe, 1550-1650","This study of Renaissance dress offers a better understanding of how fashion developed at popular levels of society in Europe, 1550-1650. Drawing on documentary, visual and material evidence, it investigates fundamental questions relating to the transformation of fashion that will shed light on popular taste, dissemination, transformation and adaption of fashion, on imitation and meaning, and on changing cultural attitudes to dress among popular groups. The central goal of the project is to develop a new methodology that combines my previous experience of empirical research and theoretical models with the tradition of textile analysis and costume conservation. This involves experimenting with a range of techniques, including technical analysis of textiles, dye- and fibre analysis, and the reconstruction and visualization of historical fashions using both 16th-century recipes as well as modern digital tools such as 3D printing and digital reconstruction. This framework of dress and textile history at both scientific and experimental levels helps me to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of the value, variations, and material experiences that were associated with dress and dressing in the Renaissance, and to develop methodologies that allow us to explore new ways in which narratives from historical documents, books, images, and material objects can be created. The new historical knowledge and methodologies built during the ERC will lead to the ultimate theoretical objective of the project –to rethink the scientific foundation and theory of dress studies within the ‘new materialist’ framework. By creating a material-based approach and methodologies to the study of fashion in the context of popular groups, my research will not only build new horizons for the study of popular dress and its material and cultural significance in the Renaissance, but it will also create a theoretical model that challenges dress historians to go beyond semiotic analysis of dress.",0,0
722,96458,No,The genomic and transcriptomic locus of sex-specific selection in birds,"It has long been understood that genes contribute to phenotypes that are then the basis of selection. However, the nature and process of this relationship remains largely theoretical, and the relative contribution of change in gene expression and coding sequence to phenotypic diversification is unclear. The aim of this proposal is to fuse information about sexually dimorphic phenotypes, the mating systems and sexually antagonistic selective agents that shape sexual dimorphism, and the sex-biased gene expression patterns that encode sexual dimorphisms, in order to create a cohesive integrated understanding of the relationship between evolution, the genome, and the animal form. The primary approach of this project is to harnesses emergent DNA sequencing technologies in order to measure evolutionary change in gene expression and coding sequence in response to different sex-specific selection regimes in a clade of birds with divergent mating systems. Sex-specific selection pressures arise in large part as a consequence of mating system, however males and females share nearly identical genomes, especially in the vertebrates where the sex chromosomes house very small proportions of the overall transcriptome. This single shared genome creates sex-specific phenotypes via different gene expression levels in females and males, and these sex-biased genes connect sexual dimorphisms, and the sexually antagonistic selection pressures that shape them, with the regions of the genome that encode them. The Galloanserae (fowl and waterfowl) will be used to in the proposed project, as this clade combines the necessary requirements of both variation in mating systems and a well-conserved reference genome (chicken). The study species selected from within the Galloanserae for the proposal exhibit a range of sexual dimorphism and sperm competition, and this will be exploited with next generation (454 and Illumina) genomic and transcriptomic data to study the gene expression patterns that underlie sexual dimorphisms, and the evolutionary pressures acting on them. This work will be complemented by the development of mathematical models of sex-specific evolution that will be tested against the gene expression and gene sequence data in order to understand the mechanisms by which sex-specific selection regimes, arising largely from mating systems, shape the phenotype via the genome.",0,0
638,198599,No,Transgenerational transmission of maternal childhood trauma and its sequelae – Altered maternal physiology during pregnancy and implications for newborn neurodevelopment,"Alarming statistics in a recent report by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights suggest that 1 in 3 women have experienced physical or sexual violence in childhood. The sequelae of childhood trauma (CT) exposure include psychopathology, altered stress physiology, obesity, and increased likelihood of exposure to violence in adulthood. Also, emerging evidence suggests the long shadow cast by CT may be transmitted to the offspring of exposed individuals, who have a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders. To date, potential pathways of transgenerational transmission have focused on the offspring’s exposure to unfavorable conditions in postnatal life (i.e., suboptimal parenting behaviors). However, it is likely that transgenerational transmission of the effects of maternal CT may start during fetal life. It is well established that CT produces endocrine and immunological dysregulation, and the persistence of such dysregulation during pregnancy may affect fetal brain development to confer increased risk for psychopathology. Despite its plausibility, fetal programming has not yet been studied as a potential transmission pathway of the effects of CT from mother to child. In this proposed prospective, longitudinal study, 200 mother-child dyads will be followed from early gestation till the neonatal period. Serial measures of stress-related endocrine (CRH, cortisol) and immune (CRP, IL-6) biology will be collected in early, mid and late gestation. At birth newborn MRI scans will be acquired to quantify volumes and connectivity of fronto-limbic brain regions. The proposed study will address specific hypotheses about the transgenerational transmission during gestation of the effects of maternal CT on her child’s brain and the role of maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune biology as a mediator of this effect. Study findings may suggest new avenues for development of prevention and intervention strategies to limit the transgenerational perpetuation of poor health.",0,0
852,207463,No,Art / culture / economy to democratize society.  Research in placemaking for alternative narratives,"The project trans-making aims to establish a multilateral network of research and innovation staff active in the fields of placemaking/place-based art activities as a space to create alternative narratives for social, economic and democratic renewal. It will investigate and experiment with placemaking to contribute actively to the democratization/well-being of society, educating and empowering individuals and disadvantaged minorities through research and production in the connection between art and new technologies. The objective is to strengthen research capacities, through exchange of knowledge and expertise between academic and non-academic partners from Europe and Third Countries in a shared research programme focused on: collecting, documenting / Exploring, experimenting / Performing / Designing. Trough those work programme of Research and Innovation, the consortium, academic and non-academics partners, aims to foster links between art and culture, economy, democracy and innovation at EU level and beyond. To foster entrepreneurial skills, risk taking adaptability, innovation capacity (economic, social and democratic). And it will contribute actively to education and empowerment of individuals and disadvantaged minorities trough research and production between art and new technologies. The project through its consortium will be to foster a better understanding and knowledge sharing between scientific community, stakeholders and policy-makers.

436,37766,No,"Investigations into the role of the transcription factor NFKB in neuronal development, neuronal function, learning/memory and neurodegeneration","Our objective is to fully characterise the role played by the transcription factor NFkB in neuronal development, ageing, neuronal function and neurodegeneration.   In particular 6 themes will be explored:  Neurotrophins, glutamate and NFkB   Constitutive NFkB in neurones   NFkB - regulated genes in brain   NFkB in brain development and ageing   NFkB in neuronal excitation, LTP and learning   NFkB in neurodegeneration.   In the first of the themes described in the objectives the ability of neurotrophins and glutamate to activate NFkB in neurones will be further studied. The neurotrophin NGF has recently been shown to activate NFkB via the neurotrophin receptor p75. This may be a key response for nerve regeneration. Glutamate is a key excitatory neurotransmitter which has been implicated in neuronal killing and in long term potentiation. Its effects on NFkB may be important for these events.   Studies on neurotrophins and glutamate will involve receptor analysis, gene induction studies, mechanism of activation and effects in vivo. In the second theme, the role of constitutive NFkB in neurons will be studied. This will involve histological studies, biochemical analysis of NFkB complexes, mechanisms underlying the constitutive activation, determination of responsive genes and the role of NFkB in cerebellar development and function. In the third area, subtractive cloning and differential display techniques will be used on transgenic mice in which NFkB is constitutively active or inactivated to determine which genes in brain are NFkB regulated. The fourth theme will assess the role of NFkB in neuronal development and ageing and will be examined by monitoring NFkB activity in the brains of developing and neonatal mice. Its importance will be assessed in transgenic mice whose neuronal or glial NFkB will either be switched off or constitutively on. These mice will also be used in the fifth area, which will assess the role played by NFkB in neuronal excitation, LTP and learning/memory. Finally the potential involvement of NFkB in neurodegeneration will be studied by assessing the effect of inflammatory cytokines and other neurodegenerative agents on NFkB; analysis of NFkB in a model of focal cerebral ischemia and finally by studying the effects of mating the transgenic mice previously described with transgenic mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases.   Using these strategies it will be possible to fully characterise the NFkB system in brain. It is likely that for some of the processes under investigation the role of NFkB will be pivotal. Overall the work is very likely to point to novel therapeutic targets based on the NFkB system for neurodegenerative disease.",0,0
1033,98587,No,Neurocognitive mechanisms of human anxiety: identifying and targeting disrupted function,"Within a 12 month period, 20% of adults will meet criteria for one or more clinical anxiety disorders (ADs). These disorders are hugely disruptive, placing an emotional burden on individuals and their families. While both cognitive behavioural therapy and pharmacological treatment are widely viewed as effective strategies for managing ADs, systematic review of the literature reveals that only 30–45% of patients demonstrate a marked response to treatment (anxiety levels being reduced into the nonaffected range). In addition, a significant proportion of initial responders relapse after treatment is discontinued. There is hence a real and marked need to improve upon current approaches to AD treatment. One possible avenue for improving response rates is through optimizing initial treatment selection. Specifically, it is possible that certain individuals might respond better to cognitive interventions while others might respond better to pharmacological treatment.  Recently it has been suggested that there may be two or more distinct biological pathways disrupted in anxiety. If this is the case, then specification of these pathways may be an important step in predicting which individuals are likely to respond to which treatment. Few studies have focused upon this issue and, in particular, upon identifying neural markers that might predict response to cognitive (as opposed to pharmacological) intervention. The proposed research aims to address this. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that there are at least two mechanisms disrupted in ADs, one entailing amygdala hyper-responsivity to cues that signal threat, the other impoverished recruitment of frontal regions that support cognitive and emotional regulation. Two series of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments will be conducted. These will investigate differences in amygdala and frontal function during (a) attentional processing and (b) fear conditioning. Initial clinical experiments will investigate whether Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobia involve differing degrees of disruption to frontal versus amygdala function during these tasks. This work will feed into training studies, the goal being to characterize AD patient subgroups that benefit from cognitive training.",0,0
493,221636,No,Unraveling the combinatorial logic of amygdala neuromodulation in decision-making and learning.,"Proper neuronal circuit function depends fundamentally on the balance of neuromodulators, a set of neurotransmitters released widely throughout the brain. Almost every mental disorder, including anxiety and depression, that affect one out of four Europeans, are associated with a neuromodulatory imbalance in specific sub-circuits. Elucidating the role of different neuromodulatory inputs to specific brain regions holds the keys to understanding and treating mood disorders.  The amygdala plays an essential role in the processing of emotional stimuli and salience, ranging from reward to threat and synaptic alterations in this region are critical for learning and emotional processing. Amygdala is innervated by every major neuromodulator, yet surprisingly little is known about the activity of these inputs under physiological conditions and how neuromodulation regulates amygdala circuit activity during different behavioral states and learning.  Here, I propose to study the functional role of neuromodulatory inputs to the amygdala circuitry during learning and decision-making. Towards this goal, I will combine my experience in large-scale electrophysiology with the expertise of the host laboratory in modern genetic tools and neurotechnologies to simultaneously record and manipulate the activity of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and acetylcholine inputs to the amygdala during context-guided decision-making in behaving mice. Using this approach, I aim to characterize the logic of interactions between neuromodulators and its implementation at the level of defined circuits and cell types in the amygdala and to demonstrate the role of this coordination in defining network activity, behavioral state and learning.  The fellowship will contribute to our basic understanding of the interplay between two core brain systems, while it will provide me with a unique opportunity to expand my expertise and establish the foundations of my future career as an independent group leader.",0,0
1054,13391,No,RADIATION SENSITIVITY IN CULTURED MAMMALIAN CELLS. GENETIC EFFECTS OF RADIATION IN EUKARYOTES AND CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS IN LYMPHOCYTES AT LOW DOSES,"EVALUATION OF GENETIC RISKS FROM IONIZING RADIATION. DETERMINATION OF CELLULAR RADIOSENSITIVITY AND RELATION TO REPAIR.   Nucleoid sedimentation experiments were performed to compare the repair capacity for strand breaks of 2 permanent cell lines deficient in excision repair (mei-9, mus-201) with that in repair proficient cells (permanent cell line Kc). After ultraviolet (UV) treatment (10 J m{-2}; 256 nm) the number of breaks detected in the mei-9 and mus-201 cells is lower than in the repair proficient Kc cells. This indicates that the first step of the excision repair process, the incision, is impaired in these mutants. The repair of X-ray induced (10 Gy) breaks, as measured by nucleoid sedimentation, appears normal in the mutants mei-9 and mus-201. To determine the repair capacity of Kc cells (proficient repair) to remove UV induced thymidine dimers from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the complete genome, several experiments were performed using alkaline sucrose gradients. Kc cells were UV irradiated and after a period of repair incubation (0, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48) the cells are lysed. The DNA is incubated with T4-endonuclease, and the molecular weight of the DNA is determined. The results show that the removal of dimers is very slow during the first 8 hours after irradiation. After 8 hours, the repair increases and at 24 hours after irradiation 95% of the dimers are removed. It has been shown that in mammalian cells and also in the lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae UV induced DNA repair is not randomly distributed over the genome. Evidence has been presented for the preferential repair of actively transcribed genes. In addition to studies on the in vivo induction of mutations in germ line cells and somatic cells in Drosophila repair proficient and deficient (mei-9 and mus-201) strains, repair of UV induced damage in 4 specific genes (GART, RpII, white and Notch) in cell lines derived from these strains, is investigated. GART is a 10 kb gene that is involved in the de novo purine synthesis. The RpII (RNA polymerase II) gene (9.4 kb) encodes for the largest subunit of ribonucl eic acid (RNA) polymerase II. The product of the white gene (6 kb) plays a role in the distribution of pigment in the fly. The Notch gene (34 kb) is expressed during embryogenesis and appears involved in the development of neurogenic tissues. Transcripts from the GART and the RpII gene were found in poly A\ RNA isolated from the repair proficient Kc cell line, by Northern blotting. In contrast, no expression of the white and Notch genes could be detected. It is found that the active gene GART as well as the inactive genes white and Notch are all repaired to the same extent. 4 hours after UV irradiation norepair is measured. After 8 hours only 20 to 30% of repair is found, 60% after 16 hours and about 80% after 24 hours up to 90% after 48 hours. The repair kinetics for these genes appears independent of the doses studied. The repair of the RNA polymerase II gene was found to be faster. Preliminary data, however, indicate that less pyrimidine dimers are induced in this gene as compared to the other genes investigated. In both excision repair deficient cell lines (mei-9 and mus-201) no removal of thymidine dimers from the Gart genes and Notch genes was found. These results are in agreement with the results obtained with other biochemical methods; ie these cells cannot introduce single strand nicks at thymidine dimers (in total genomic DNA) nor do they show unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) after UV irradiation.  Repair kinetics in relation to chromosomal aberration formation: When irradiated human lymphocytes were posttreated with a repair inhibitor, such as cytosine arabinoside (ara C), the yield of aberrations (dicentrics and fragments) increased. When the ara C treatment was given for 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes, most of the increase in the frequency of aberration was found to occur in the first 15 minutes. If irradiated lymphocytes were allowed to recover for 30 minutes and then challenged with ara C, there was no increase in the frequency of aberrations indicating that fast repairing lesions lead to the formation of aberrations. Parallel studies with premature chromosome condensation (PCC), in which lymphocytes were irradiated and fused immediately or allowed to repair for 60 minutes in the presence or absence of ara C indicated that about 50% of breaks disappear during this repair, while in the presence of ara C, there was a complete inhibition of repair of breaks. When a nucleoid sedimentation technique (which measures the induction of deoxyribonucleic (DNA) strand breaks) was used under a similar protocol, it was seen that ara C completely inhibited the repair of strand breaks. These results pointed out that fast repairing DNA strand breaks induced by X-rays lead to chromosomal aberrations.  The PCC technique and conventional metaphase chromosome analysis were used to examine the kinetics of X-ray induced primary breaks, their rejoining and formation of dicentrics in human lymphocytes. A dose dependent increase in the frequency of fragments and a linear quadratic increase in the frequency of dicentrics were observed. The frequency of fragments was much higher (factor of about 10) when determined by PCC technique immediately after irradiation in comparison to the frequencies observed in metaphases. For an assessment of repair kinetics irradiated lymphocytes were fused with mitotic Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells either immediately or after several recovery times a fter irradiation. It was found that the frequency of chromosome fragments decreased with time whereas the dicentrics were formed very fast and their frequency remained the same, despite the decrease in the number of fragments with increased recovery time. These results confirm our earlier findings using repair inhibitor ara C, which indicated that early repairing lesions (strand breaks) lead to chromosomal aberrations, especially the exchange types.  Chromatin structure in relation to yield of chromosomal aberrations: We have demonstrated earlier that when lymphocytes were incubated in a medium containing sodium butyrate, which hyperacetylates histones, thus relaxing DNA, prior to X-ray irradiation increased the yield of aberrations. When human lymphocytes were fused to mitotic CHO cells irradiated with X-rays (2 Gy), immediately or after 30 minutes or 60 minutes the frequency of induced breaks fell dramatically with increased condensation. It has been suggested that treatment with hypertonic salt solution suppresses the fast component of repair of radiation induced strand breaks. This should increase the frequency of chromosome breaks. Hypertonic treatment is also expected to condense the chromatin which could prevent accessibility to repair enzymes, thus increasing the frequency of induced breaks. 2 types of experiments were carried out to study the role of hypertonic salt solution on the yield of X-ray induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes. In a fractionation regime, lymphocytes were irradiated in the medium or a hypertonic salt solution (0.3 M sodium chloride), with 1 Gy and allowed to recover for 30 minutes or 90 minutes and irradiated further with 1 Gy. The lymphocytes were fused with mitotic CHO cells and the frequencies of dicentrics and fragments were evaluated in PCCs. Contrary to the expectation, the yield of dicentrics and fragments was reduced in the lymphocytes irradiated in the presence of hypotonic solution. In another experiment, lymphoc ytes were X-ray irradiated with 3 Gy alone, or they were irradiated in the medium or treated with a hypertonic salt solution before and after irradiation, or irradiated in cold isotonic solution and transferred immediately to hypertonic salt solution. After 30 minutes postincubation, lymphocytes were cultured for 48 hours and the frequency of aberrations was evaluated. The frequency of dicentrics was very similar in all treatments except the one in which the lymphocytes were irradiated in hypertonic salt solution, which responded with lower (about 40%) number of dicentrics. These results indicate that, at least in isolated lymphocytes, irradiation under hypertonic conditions reduces the frequencies of aberrations probably due to induced chromatin condensation.  Inducible repair in human lymphocytes: It has been reported that human lymphocytes subjected to a small conditioning dose of radiation leads to some protection (in terms of yield of chromosomal aberrations) to a challenging higher dose of radiation, a phenomenon termed as adaptive response. 2 series of experiments were carried out with whole blood from healthy volunteers: 1 in which radioisotopes were used to administer the conditioning dose, and the other in which a low dose of X-rays was used as the conditioning treatment. 2 important findings emerged from these experiments: first, in cells that received both the conditioning and the challenge doses, the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations (chromatid and isochromatid deletions) were lower than expected on the basis of additivity of the effects of individual treatments; these results thus support those published from Wolff's laboratory in showing that human lymphocytes can become adapted by prior exposure to low level irradiation so that they become less sensitive to the chromosome breaking effects of X-rays delivered subsequently. Second, the magnitude of reduction in aberration frequencies in the adapted cells varied between the different donors (and also between blood samples from the same donor exposed to different radioisotopes), was generally lower than those observed in the studies from Wolff's laboratory and, with lymphocytes from some donors, no adaptive response could be demonstrated. This finding is consistent with the existence of interindividual differences with respect to the magnitude of the adaptive response, a finding which has received support from the work of Bosi and Olivier!  Chromosomal aberrations induced by restriction endonucleases: Among the DNA lesions induced by ionising radiations, DNA double strand breaks (DSB) appear to be the most important one leading to chromosomal aberrations. We have provided both biochemical and cytological evidence for this conclusion. When CHO cells are permeabilised with inactivated Sandai virus and treated with restriction endonucleases (RE) (which exclusively induces DNA DSBs), chromosomal aberrations are induced in a pattern similar to that induced by ionising radiation, namely chromosome type in G1 and chromatid type in G2 and a mixture in the S phase. When CHO cells were treated with the restriction enzyme Alu I and posttreated with ara C, the frequency of aberrations increased indicating the ara C can inhibit rejoining of RE induced DSBs. Ara C has a similar influence on X-ray induced breaks. This indicates that X-ray induced DSBs respond in a similar way as RE induced DSBs to ara C.  Influence of incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on the induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and cleaving of DNA by REs differing in their recognition sequences especially the number and postion of thymidine nucleosides was investigated.  For induction of SCEs, it was found that the efficiency of RE did not depend on the nature of the initial cleavage, blunt and cohesive breaks were equally effective in inducing SCEs, whereas blunt ends were more effective in inducing chromosomal aberrations. It was found that mid S phase was the most sensitive phase for the induction of chromosomal alterations. Restriction pattern analysis of DNA from BrdU (100%) substituted and unsubstituted nuclei following Alu I digestion, showed some inhibition at 100% level, which may be responsible for less efficient induction of SCEs by this RE. Some increase in the frequency of induced chromosomal aberrations BrdU substituted cells was found which may indicate that incorporated BrdU may interfere with the repair of the induced strand breaks, since BrdU substitution was not found to significantly influence the induction of strand breaks by different REs.  Dose response relationships for the induction of mutations at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na/K-ATPase) loci have been determined. After treatment the cells were propagated for expression of the induced mutations and subsequently seeded for selection of mutants. After 8 days of selection mutant colonies were fixed, stained and counted.  Consequences of the presence of the human excision repair cross complementing (ERCC-1) gene in repair deficient 43-3B cells: The human gene restores the sensitivities to deoxyribonucleic (DNA) damaging agents of the repair deficient rodent cells to normal levels. Also the frequency of induced mutations after treatment with ultraviolet (UV) returnals to the level of rodent wild type cells. The data suggested that the ERCC-1 gene largely corrects all impaired functions in the defective 43-3B cells and that therefore the ERCC-1 gene is probably homologous with respect to function to the defective gene in 43-3B cells.  Characterisation of the UV sensitive mutant VH-1: The dose repose relationships for mutations induced by UV in VH-1 cells were linear. Mutation induction at the sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase locus was 4-fold enhanced and at the HPRT-locus, 7-fold enhanced. These increases are lower than might have been expected on the basis of the approximately 10-fold enhanced UV sensitivity with regard to survival. V-H1 cells were also compared with V79 wild type cells and with 2 UV sensitive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutants of the same complementation group with respect to induction to unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) by UV. The level of UDS in V-H1 is only slightly reduced compared to wild type cells while the 2 other mutants of the same complementation group show only the background level of UDS. These data show that a phenotypic heterogeneity exists within the second complementation group of UV sensitive mutants. It is hypothesised that t he repair gene of this complementation group has more than 1 functionally important domain or that the gene is involved in preferential repair of active genes.  Characterisation of the X-ray sensitive mutants V-15B, V-C8, V-C4 and E5: Despite that V-15B cells are approximately 8-fold more sensitive to X-rays than wild type cells the mutation induction was not significantly enhanced. Mutants from the same complementation group have been shown to depend on epigenetic alterations as they can be induced to revert by 5-azacytidine. We found that reversion of V-15B cannot be induced by 5-azacytidine. Despite the fact that V-G8, V-C4 and V-E5 belong to the same complementation group, different levels of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations were observed. For V-G8 these frequencies were similar to that observed in wild type cells whereas an increase of about 2-fold and 6-fold was found for V-E5 and V-C4 respectively. In all 3 mutants the frequencies of X-ray induced aberrations were higher in comparison to wild type V79 cells in both G1 and G2 cells. The types of aberrations induced in G1 cells were mainly of the chromosome type in the normal cells, whereas in all 3 X-ray sensitive mutants, both chromosome exchanges and chromatid exchanges were found to occur within the same cell. These levels and patterns of chromosomal aberrations are similar to those observed in cells derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia. As the biochemical characteristics of these cells also agree with those observed for ataxia telangiectasia, our mutants from the new complementation group are the first rodent repair deficient mutants which phenotypically resemble ataxia telangiectasia cells.  Characterisation of the mytomycin C (MMC) sensitive mutant V-H4: The level of spontaneous chromosome aberrations is almost 2-fold increased in V-H4 and the level of chromosome abnormalities induced by treatment with MMC or cis-diamminedichtoroplatinum (cis-DDP) is 2 to 3 fold higher in this mutant than in the wild type cells. Preliminary results indicate that V-H4 is rather hypomutable after treatment with (8-MOP) plus near ultraviolet (UVA), 4-nitroquinoline-N-1-oxide (4NQO) or ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS).  This project studies the biochemical aspects of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair induced by radiation, in normal cells as well as radiosensitive mutants, in relation to biological endpoints such as cell killing, induction of gene mutations, and chromosomal aberrations. Radiosensitive cell lines in which the radiosensitivity is complemented by the introduction of a cloned repair gene will also be investigated. Emphasis will be put on: the role of chromatin structure in the distribution and repair of damage induced by radiation; the nuclear localisation of the various steps of the repair process; the structure of DNA repair patches using inhibitors of DNA synthesis.  Our results suggest that ultraviolet (UV) induced repair synthesis is not confined to the nuclear matrix, as has been shown for replication and transcription. The efficiency of repair may be based on a sliding mechanism as has been proposed for incision of bulky damage by the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) ABC enzymes in Escherichia coli. The occurrence of clustered repaired sites within DNA loops is in favour of repair enzymes processively operating along DNA molecules. In fact a substantial fraction of incisions was observed at interdimer distance which is consistent with a processively acting repair process. In the presence of hydroxyurea, ligation or polymerisation following the incision step was delayed leading to single strand breaks within DNA molecules. It is clear that in human fibroblasts certain domains within the chromatin are more rapidly repaired than the bulk of chromatin. These domains are located proximal to the nuclear matrix end and comprise transcriptionally active DNA. We have shown that the heterogeneity in distribution of repaired sites in chromatin loops correlates with the heterogeneity in removal of pyrimidine dimers from the genome. Yet it is more likely that the preferential repair of nuclear matrix associated DNA observed in normal cells exposed to low UV dose, reflects p referential repair of another important type of photoadduct namely the 6-4 photoproduct (6-4 PP) since repair incorporation initially after irradiation can be almost exclusively attributed to repair of 6-4 pyrimidine dimer (PD). Our data suggest that repair of 6-4 PP is subject to the same regime as removal of PD ie preferentially directed towards repair of transcriptionally active DNA. The absence of preferential repair at high UV dose may be due to a sufficient local disruption of chromatin structure to allow efficient interaction of repair enzymes with bulk chromatin. Our findings suggest the existence of 2 independently operating pathways directed towards repair of PD in either active or inactive chromatin Xeroderma pigmentosum group c (XP-C) cells have lost the capacity to repair inactive chromatin, but are still able to repair active chromatin. The reverse situation may exist in cells from Cockayne's syndrome (CS) patients, which appear to be unable to perform efficient repair of active genes. Although direct evidence is lacking repair of PD in active achromatin may be mediated by the transcription process itself. The experiments with XP-C cells indicate that the preferential repair of PD from active genes confers considerable UV resistance to confluent cells in the absence of efficient repair of 6-4 PP. In growing cells UV resistance seems to be provided both by preferential repair of PD from active genes and efficient removal of 6-4 PP from the genome overall, pointing to a strong cytotoxic potency of 6-4 PP. The absence of preferential repair of PD in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene concomitant with a high frequency of mutations in this locus in UV sensitive hamster V-H1 cells points to a dominant role of PD in mutagenesis. However recent data obtained with revertants of V-H1 cells showed the absence of PD repair in the HPRT gene, but mutation frequencies similar to wild type V79. This phenomenon is not well understood at the moment, but indicates a role of 6-4 PD in mutagenesis as well.  The project aims to isolate and characterise repair deficient mutants from mammalian cell cultures. Rodent cells (V79 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are mutagenised in order to induce mutations in genes which are involved in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. Via replica plating clones are identified which are sensitive to DNA damaging agents.  During the course of this project a large number of repair deficient mutants have been obtained from CHO cells. The V79 cell line appears to be very suitable for the isolation of repair deficient mutants. The complementation analysis has been completed for 9 of the 13 repair deficient mutants and 2 new complementation groups have been identified. 2 for ultraviolet (UV) and 1 for X-rays. Especially rewarding was the finding that V-H4 is homologous with Fanconi's anaemia complementation group A. As presently conditions have been found which permit an efficient transfection of DNA into V79 CHO cells, this opens the exciting possibility of isolating the human gene which is defective in Fanconi's anaemia. The isolation of revertants from V-H1, which are still phenotypically different from wild type, will be important for the study of the function of the excision repair cross complementing (ERCC-2) gene of complementation group 2 which has been recently isolated.  Amherst-M56i wild type males are irradiated (15 Gy) and mated with repair proficient (mei\) females, excision repair deficient females (mus-201) and postreplication repair deficient (mei-41) females. Only mutations induced in mature sperm are collected. The mutants are analysed and classified according to genetic and cytogenetic characteristics in intragenic mutations and gross chromosomal aberrations (multilocus deletions, translocations, inversions) Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole body white mutants from the first class (intragenic mutations) was analysed by molecular techniques including restriction enzyme pattern, S1 protection experiments and, when neccesary, sequencing.  A comparison of all the data indicate, that due to the defect in the excision repair of mus-201 females, among the recovered X-ray induced mutations relatively more intragenic deletions and less multilocus deletions are present than in repair proficient condition. The reverse appears true after recovery in postreplication repair deficient mei-41 females.  Vermilion mutants were induced by exonuclease (ENU) or ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) treatment. Mutant alleles were cloned in phage lambda using the recombinational screening method or cloned directly in M13 vectors after amplification in vitro polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Single stranded plasmid or M13 deoxyribonucleic (DNA) was then used for the sequence determination using a set of oligonucleotide primers.  ENU induced and 28 EMS induced mutants were analysed. 3 ENU and 1 EMS mutant represent double mutations. Transition mutations were the most prominent sequence change after ENU treatment. Both guanine cytosine-adenine thymine (GC-AT) and AT-GC transition mutations can be explained by mispairing of the 06-ethylguanine and 04-ethylthymine adducts with thymine and guanine, respectively. The AT-TA transversions in case of ENU can be explained by the 02-ethylthymine adduct. However, AT-TA transversions are also induced by EMS although EMS treatment does not result in 02-ethylthymine adducts. Most likely the transversion mutations results from alkylation of the base nitrogen atoms. Comparison of the alterations in F1 and F2 mutants did not show significant differences. The strong contribution of 06-ethylguanine adduct to the mutagenicity of both ENU and EMS possibly explains the absence of distinct differences between the type of mutations observed in F1 and F2 mutants.  Drosophila repair deficient mutants were characterised biochemically in primary cell cultures, ie somatic cells. In contrast, most of the genetic effects of these mutants have been studied in cells of the germ line. To improve the correlation between these 2 levels it was decided to investigate the effects of repair deficient mutants on the mutation induction in somatic cells.  Female larvae of repair deficient mutant strains, heterozygous for an X-linked recessive white eye mutation w/w\ were X-irradiated. The emerging adult flies were scored for (induced) clones of white spots (ommatidia) in the eyes. These spots arise as the result of mutations (point mutation,deletion), complete/partial chromosome loss and recombination events. The number and size of the clones was used to estimate mutation rates.  The frequency of spontaneously occuring small spots is significantly higher in mei-41 females (compared to mei\). This increase is not observed among the larger spots. After X-irradiation, especially the induction of the larger spots is enhanced in mei-41 females. This effect appears stronger after irradiation in anoxic than in oxic conditions. These results differ from those obtained in excision repair deficient (mei-9) females; in these females the spontaneous and induced frequency of both types of spots is increased. In both cases (mei-41 and mei-9) the induced frequency of spots is much higher in these w/w\ heterozygous females than in w\/Y hemizyous males  The last result indicates that recombination events especially are increased after X-irradiation in repair deficient conditions. The fact that this increase in mei-41 females is stronger in anoxic conditions may indicate that in these flies, recombinational events result from the misrepair of X-ray induced base damage.  A series of mutants of Drosophila melanogaster have been reported that are deficient in repair of ultraviolet (UV) induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Although the mutants alter in general the frequency of X-ray induced genetic damage, no repair defects could be demonstrated yet for X-ray induced DNA damage. Also the detected increases and decreases in the frequencies of X-ray induced genetic damage were relatively small. The direct selection of X-ray hypersensitive mutants was considered but was supposed to be complicated as X-rays are known to induce a wide range of DNA lesions. Instead bleomycin was chosen as the selection agent as it produces primarily DNA strand breaks which are also an important type of lesion induced by X-ray irradiation.  Males flies were mutagenised with exonuclease (ENU) and mated to attached-X females. The F1 males were crossed individually to attached-X females and the F2 cultures were treated with bleomycin. The absence or decreased frequency of males in the F2 indicates a potential bleomycin sensitive mutant.  In total 13807 mutagenised X-chromosomes were screened. Based on the dose of ENU used for the induction and the number of X-linked genes, it can be calculated that (assuming a random induction of mutation) each gene was mutated 4 times. 5 mutants have been isolated that shows a slight hypersensitivity to bleomycin.  The frequency of recovered bleomycin hypersensitive mutants is low compared to that of methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) hypersensitive mutants. As bleomycin induces far less different types of DNA damage than MMS, it is to be expected that mutations at fewer loci will confer bleomycin hypersensitivity. Presumably only a small number of loci are involved in the repair of DNA strand breaks  The mobile element P can be used to clone specific genes. Mutations due to the insertion of a P-element in a gene, will provide a 'tag' which can be used to isolate the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences of the mutated gene. To clone DNA repair genes, mutations have to be made in these genes with P-element.  Dysgenic flies are generated in which the mobile element P is transposing at high frequency in germ line cells. Dysgenic males carrying a Pm balancer chromosome are crossed to C(1)DX females. The F2 Pm males are mated individually to mus-201 (excision repair deficient methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) hypersensitive) females for 2 days after which the parental flies are transferred to new culture vials. MMS is added to the first vial. The vials are scored for the presence or absence of Pm flies in the F3. If a P-induced mus-201 is present on the Pm chromosome, only Pm\ flies will survive the MMS treatment. A total of 27,033 second chromosomes and no P-induced mus-201 mutation were detected.  In Drosophila it is evident that many spontaneous mutations and chromosome aberrations are the result of transposition of mobile elements. Since spontaneous genetic endpoints form a convenient frame of reference for physically induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and chemically induced DNA damage, it is important to study the effect of mutagenic agents on mobile elements and the process of transposition. One of the systems to study such interactions in Drosophila is the transposition of P-elements. However, since there exists considerable heterogeneity among the strains carrying P-elements, these strains have to be characterised in detail.  We studied a number of particular P-strains, MR-strains, that are characterised by the fact that the P-activity in principle is limited to 1 isolated chromosome only. Functional P-elements are 2.9 kb long, including an intact 2.4 kb Acc I fragment.  The results show that the genetic effects in MR-h12/Cy are correlated with 1 complete P-element only, complete P-elements exist without any genetic activity and since the activity of complete P-elements in the same P-strain can vary in activity, the differences in genetic activity of the different MR-strains cannot directly be related to the number of complete elements.  Spontaneous hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mutations in lymphocytes: In order to improve our understanding of spontaneous mutants in human lymphocytes, use was made of the cloning method for genetic alterations in the HPRT gene. Mutant frequencies (Mf) were determined in 28 nonsmokers and 23 smokers. Mean Mf values and standard deviations for the 2 groups were 10.0 \/- 10.7E-6 and 11.1 \/- 15.7E-6 respectively. The effect of smoking was not statistically significant. For the pooled data of the 2 groups it could be calculated that Mf values increased significantly with age (range 19 to 60 years) with a rate of 1.8% per year.  A total of 31 mutants from 10 normal nonsmoking donors was used to determine the spectrum of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence alterations in the coding region of the HPRT gene. For this purpose messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from expanded HPRT mutant clones was converted into complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) which was then used for DNA sequence analysis after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In 12 of 31 mutants a single base pair substitution was observed. These were equally divided in transitions and transversions. Furthermore, 5 frame shift mutations and 2 small deletions of 9 and 12 base pairs were found. In 12 of 31 mutants 1 or 2 exons were completely or partially deleted in the HPRT mRNA, probably because of a mutation in a splice acceptor site of the HPRT gene.  HPRT mutant frequencies in patients receiving a low dose of gamma rays: Blood samples were collected from 13 nuclear medicine patients undergoing a ventriculographic examination of heart function with technetium-99 m. Mean Mf values plus standard deviations for pretreatment and posttreatment samples were 21.2 \/- 19.9E-6 and 11.1 \/- 7.2E-6 respectively. The decrease of 52% in the mutant frequency after the nuclear medicine procedure proved to be statistically significant (probability less than 0.03). This result does not confirm that Seifert et al who concluded that technetium tre The induction of structural chromosomal changes forms a significant portion of the genetic damage produced by ionizing radiation. For human risk estimates one has to extrapolate from experiments with laboratory animals such as the mouse and, to a limited extent, primates, to the human situation. During 1990 different aspects of translocation induction in spermatogonial stem cells were studied. In the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) the effects of combined  treatments with FSH (54 I.U./kg/week) and X-rays (1 Gy) were examined. An insignificant decrease of 30% in the frequency of induced translocations was recorded for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) pretreated animals. Comparison of these translocation data with studies on cell killing in the same monkeys show that the ratio between the probabilities that radiation induced basic lesions kill a cell or produce translocations is about 10 to 1. This value of 10 is very similar to that observed for the mouse or calculated on theoretical grounds.   All data so far obtained in the rhesus monkey (dose-effect relationship, dose-rate effect, the effect of radiation quality, etc.) suggest that testicular repopulation after radiation damage in rhesus monkeys is mainly responsible for the observed differences between mouse and monkey. There is also evidence available that the recovery of radiation damage in the rhesus monkey is comparable to that seen in steel (Sl) and dominant spotting (W) mutations in the mouse. Preliminary data obtained by us point to a recovery of translocations from 3 Gy irradiated Wv/\ (viable allele of dominant spotting) and Slcon/Slcon (contrasted allele of steel) male mice which is comparable to the low frequencies observed in the rhesus monkey.",0,0
40,69206,Yes,Les femmes dans la pêche et les Cultures marines en Europe,"The thematic network 'Femmes' intends to bring together research centres, fisherwomen association, representatives of maritime administration and social institutions to promote and co-ordinate in Europe fisherwomen initiatives to enhance the recognition of their status and role in fishing enterprises and in fishing communities. Network activities will cover issues related to the status and action of women in artisanal fisheries and shell fish culture. Thematic network aims to cover the following aspects: fisherwomen network development., internal and external exchanges through workshops, research popularisation and production of two agendas address to decision makers. One of this agenda will identify the main priorities on gender research and the second will cover women in action in fisheries sector. For the moment 5 countries are involved in the network. During the three year the network can be joint by others organisations working on theses issues.  Objectives The objectives of the network 'FEMMES ' are the following: - Establishing links between social sciences researchers working in the field of fisheries and aquaculture, the women involved in this sector, and the representative structures of fisherwomen organisations such as social institutions, administrations and training institutions, - Making an inventory of the initiatives already existing in this field in Europe, either fisher-women organisations or research actions, and providing a 'place for exchanges and reflections' at the European level, - Providing a preliminary opportunity in order to create a network of relationships between the fisherwomen organisations at the European level and initial contacts with similar networks in other sectors of activity, - Promoting within the field of social sciences the theme of research about women, from this reflection and through the identification of research lines to develop, - Making a preliminary assessment, in the form of discussion workshops between researchers and actors, of the role of women in this sector, and ensuring the communication and dissemination of information, including the popularisation of scientific research work.  Description of the work The network is initiated by researchers and fisherwomen. The network's co-ordination and administrative management (WP1) are under the responsibility of the Centre for the Law and Economics of the Sea (CEDEM) of the University of Western Brittany in France. A few institutions, mainly fisherwomen organisations and research institutions, have accepted to play a concrete role within the network as contractors or members. From this core, the network's vocation consists in integrating more and more people, either individually or on behalf of organisations. In order to conduct the debate a permanent secretary office for the network is created within the co-ordinator. A steering committee consisting of 3 scientists and 2 fisherwomen is formed to assist the co-ordinator in the management of the network. The activities of the network consist in two types of action : 1- the animation of discussion groups in a workshop format: The first year will be devoted to the discussion of the theme 'Women and Private Space' (WP2, two workshops) and the second year for the theme 'Women and Public Space' (WP3, two workshops). The contributions and discussions of the workshops will be published in proceedings in the form of two volumes widely distributed within the network and beyond. The network will produce agendas for decision-makers based on these discussions (WP6). These documents are an 'Agenda for research about women' and an 'Agenda for women action'. 2- cross actions that will be undertaken during all the 'life' of the network : One will consist in popularising research works in the area of fisheries through the production of synthesis sheets (WP4). The other will concern the inventory of all fisherwomen organisations existing in the Union, the design of a website, the edition of a biannual newsletter and the dissemination of the results of the network's activity (WP5).  A major function of the network will be to enhance communication among European fisherwomen organisations and between scientists and fisher-women. Attempt will be made to keep up with four working languages within all activities of the network: French, Spanish, Portuguese and English.  Milestones There are four milestones for the follow-up of the development of the network. The first step (M1) is the structuring of the network, during which all the functional structure should be set, including secretariat steering committee, website, newsletter, workshop and scientific synthesis methodology. Then the production of the proceedings of the first series of working groups ('Women in private space) will mark the capacity of the network to conduct the discussion up to a synthetic document for dissemination (M2). A third key milestone is the production of the agendas for decision-makers (M3) as the concluding step of two years of debate animation in the workshops. Finally, the capacity of the network to ensure it further development after the end of the initial funding will be crucial criteria to evaluate its results (M4).",0,1

INHERIT will bring together relevant stakeholders from different sectors, including the private sector. It will support inter-sectoral cooperation between environment, climate and health by: a) Analysing existing scientific knowledge on key environmental stressors to health and approaches to address these; b) Identifying existing promising inter-sector policies and interventions that enable conditions for more healthy and environmentally sustainable behaviours, in three main areas: living, consuming and moving; c) Developing a Common Analytical Framework using impact assessment tools and quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess the social, environmental and health benefits and the economic value in promising inter-sectoral interventions; d) Developing targets and future visions while considering overall economic and politics contexts and global trends (i.e. participatory back-casting, stakeholder and citizen consultations and household surveys); e) Implementing, testing and evaluating pilot interventions in different European contexts; f) Enhancing the leadership skills of public health professionals in inter-sectoral work to address key environmental stressors to health and promote healthy and environmentally sustainable lifestyles; g) Translating evaluation findings into models of good practice for effective inter-sectoral work and evidence based tools for policy development to contribute to the global and European environment, health and sustainable development policy agenda. The novelty of INHERIT lies in its support for health, environment and climate sectors to jointly pursue the inter-related goals of improving health and well-being of the population while preserving the environment.",0,0
305,95505,No,Co-funding of International Fellowships in Cancer Research,"The Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC), the Italian leading charity providing about 40% of all research funds invested in cancer research in Italy, proposes to award 60 fellowship-years for international mobility in two yearly calls for proposals. The calls will be published, executed, and concluded in the 4 years of the FELCARES duration. AIRC aims at increasing its international dimension by strengthening its current programme of Outgoing Fellowships and by introducing the new tool of Incoming and Re-integration Fellowships. To reach this goal, AIRC will: a)Increase the number of the international fellowship-year from 12 awarded in 2008 to 30 per year to be awarded in FELCARES; b)Increase its own budget committed per year; c)Increase the fellowship’ wages from the current average 30.279 Euro/year to an average 40.000 Euro/year. AIRC will take advantage of its well-established and transparent criteria and methods for the evaluation and selection of the applications, adapting them to the new proposed international dimension. In the new international calls, AIRC will address the following issues: Multidisciplinary and multisectorial approaches to cancer research;Attention to researchers from less-favoured countries in Europe and worldwide;Complementary skills training in the projects to be awarded;Special care to achieving the optimal gender balance in cancer research.The anticipated outcomes of the proposed international fellowship programme will coincide with the main objectives of ERA. Bringing its initiatives to a wider international level, AIRC will expand its worldwide contacts and will get in touch with other similar programmes in Europe. This will contribute to overcome the fragmentation of the many programmes that are currently implemented in a dispersive manner.Furthermore the addition of the new fellowship scheme will definitely increase the flow of competent researchers through Europe and will bring to a wide-opening of the ERA to the world.",0,0
72,226269,Yes,Certification-Award Systems to Promote gender Equality in Research,"The CASPER project, in response to the SwafS-11-2019 call, aims at examining the feasibility of establishing a European award or certification system for gender equality in research organisations. On the basis of an in-depth assessment of existing relevant systems, the project proposes to devise and validate four scenarios, including a no-action scenario, in co-creation with national and international stakeholders. Each scenario will be examined via a walk-through methodology to understand their respective  strengths/weaknesses, costs/benefits, other positive/negative impacts or their contextual relevance, and subsequently validated with stakeholders. The project will focus predominantly on gender-related inequalities in research and innovation, and will incorporate an intersectional perspective where possible. It will take place over a 2-year period, and consider not only the EU and its Member States but also relevant countries for gender equality certification/award systems such as NO, IS, CH, US or AU.",0,1
27,209587,Yes,Gender and transnational Humanitarian Commitment for Children (Europe - 1980-2007),"The main objective of this project is to examine the extent to which “gender”, as category of analysis, can be a useful tool in explaining the nature and the impact of humanitarian aid of western organizations towards children in Europe, between 1980 and 2007, using as case study the relation France (initiator)-Romania (beneficiary). The main objectives are:  to identify all the stakeholders involved in the humanitarian aid for children, the targeted problems, if the large framework of intervention to see if formally it addressed these gender particularities; to describe the grassroots activity and the human resources of the humanitarian organisations involved in aiding the children, with a special focus on the motivation(s) that stood behind both the personal and institutional involvement and of there any differences between women and men; a survey on the local impact of each of the major intervention axes, insisting on sensitive issues, such as the accusations of paedophilia and the scandal surrounding international adoptions. This project is at the crossroad of four highly interdisciplinary research areas: Humanitarian aid, gender studies, childhood studies and European Studies and, accordingly, uses specific methodological approaches. The research will benefit from the extensive use of archives and oral testimonies from those that were directly part both of the process of decision, sources that are presently insufficient or unexplored. The research challenges the monolith unity of the Eastern Bloc. By studying the institutional, personal and conceptual relationships, the fellow wants to confront this statement with sources that have not yet been exploited. It will highlight the complexity of transnational humanitarianism towards children, with its undeniable benefits but also the questionable aspects, such as human traffic. This research intends to deliver a “Good Practice Guide” on humanitarian actions towards children Short summary should be given here.",1,1
1009,26904,No,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infections in the Pathogenesis of Esophageal Cancer in the High-Risk Area of China,"Our previous studies have shown the presence of a high percentage of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the esophagus in the high-risk areas for esophageal cancer (EC) in China, where EC has been an endemic disease for generations. These data, being in alignment with the currently available evidence on the etiological role of HPV in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas at other mucosal sites, have implicated HPV as a potential etiological agent in human esophageal carcinogenesis as well. However, the previous studies have only included small numbers of biopies, well-organized and extensive epidemiological studies are urgently needed to assess the prevalence of esophageal HPV infections, and their association with esophageal carcinogenesis. During 1990-1992 our Chinese collaborators in Zhengzhou of China have collected a series of more than 2000 esophageal specimens derived from more than 700 patients suffering from a variety of esophageal squamous epithelial lesions, with pertinent clinical data available. Using multiple histopathological and DNA-detecting techniques which have been well established in our papillomavirus research laboratories in Kuopio of Finland and Heidelberg of Germany, such as light- and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, DNA in situ hybridization, Southern blot and dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism, as well as viral isolating, cloning and DNA sequencing techniques, we are planning to systematically evaluate the prevalence of HPV infections in the high-risk area for EC in China, the associations of infectious agents (particularly HPV) with esophageal cancer, and the synergistic actions between HPV and other carcinogenic factors as well as infectious agents, e.g., HSV, CMV, EBV, and fungi. Meanwhile, the prognostic factors for EC will be also analyzed in Siena of Italy by using immunohistochemical cytokeratin staining and multiple histoquantitive methods. These systematic evaluations of EC in the high-risk area using modern pathological and biological techniques could certainly obtain valuable information on the etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis of EC, and therefore provide reliable experimental data for prevention and treatment of this fatal disease in the future.",0,0
1013,211223,No,Investigating the predictors of intimate partner violence: a mixed method longitudinal study in Tanzania,"This study proposes a major advance in research on intimate partner violence (IPV), a prominent public health and human rights issue. Worldwide, it is estimated that one in three women experience physical and/or sexual violence by a partner in their lifetime, with even higher rates reported in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO 2013). Cross-sectional surveys have documented the adverse health impacts of IPV and the factors that increase risk of female victimisation and male perpetration. Nonetheless, theoretical and programmatic development has stalled due to lack of clarity on the temporality of identified associations: do documented associations represent risk factors for violence or do they reflect the consequences of abuse? This deficit of understanding is especially pressing in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where few longitudinal cohort studies with IPV as an outcome exist. This study seeks to address this gap by following forward in time a cohort of 1200 Tanzanian women, using state of the art methods to measure violence, encourage disclosure and ensure participant safety. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at 4 discrete time points over 5 years, making this the largest longitudinal study of IPV ever undertaken in the developing world. In addition, an in-depth study of 40 men and a cross-sectional survey of 600 men will be conducted. The goal of the research is to advance our understanding of the predictors and consequences of IPV to better inform the design of interventions to reduce violence in LMICs.  Specifically the study aims to: 1) advance the theoretical frameworks of intimate partner violence; 2) investigate the temporality of key factors linked to IPV; 3) map the dynamics of partner violence over time; 4) and investigate pathways leading to intimate partner violence. This research is of immediate necessity to address a vital public health challenge of our time and has the strong potential to have a long lasting impact on shaping the research agenda on intimate partner violence.",1,0
