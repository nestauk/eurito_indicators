794,106501,No,Novel catalyst materials for the cathode side of MEAs suitable for transportation applications,"Novel low temperature fuel cell (FC) cathode catalyst and support systems will be designed and synthesized. The focus will be on highly active catalyst materials for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) for transportation applications. These materials will be fully characterized, benchmarked and validated with a multi-scale bottom up approach in order to significantly reduce the amount of precious metal catalyst loadings (< 0.15 g/kW) and to vastly improve fuel cell efficiency and durability. Thereby, materials compatible and stable under automotive fuel cell environment and conditions will be investigated in order to reach a FC lifetime of 5000h. These targets are highly relevant to the call topic requesting ambitious, highly novel concepts for next generation European membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for transportation applications. Numerical simulations will be used in order to identify which alloy compositions to strive for in the experimental work. These alloys will be synthesized both in the form of well defined model compounds as well as in the form of nanoparticles. Different modified support materials will be studied.  For the NPs, there will be two stages of preparation, the small scale preparation to create well defined NPs for preliminary assessment of their performance and stability, and, subsequently, up-scaling for MEA production. Supported NP catalysts and model catalysts will be tested using electrochemical methods and Surface Science approaches. After up-scaling MEAs based on improved cathode catalysts and improved supports will be assembled using advanced Nafion- based and high temperature membrane based electrolytes. These will be tested for performance and durability using procedures established in automotive industry and previous EU projects.",0,0
668,209248,No,Development of a high-resolution method to monitor structural changes of regulatory RNAs and therapeutic oligo-nucleotides directly in-cell.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators in cells with a complexity yet to be unraveled. By targeting one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs) they affect a vast number of biological processes and are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancer. This makes them potential candidates for cancer-diagnostics and -therapeutics. This opportunity can only be fully exploited by a better comprehension of how and when each mRNA is targeted by a miRNA, a fact, which is currently still poorly understood. Besides regulatory RNAs, synthetic “anti-sense” oligonucleotides (AONs) are currently tested as cancer drugs. Progress in this field has been slow due to unspecific off-target-effects i.e. the lack of understanding, of the mechanism of AONs targeting mRNAs. This project focuses on overcoming this lack of knowledge of the targeting process. To understand the intermolecular interactions occurring in the cell we will, for the first time, monitor the molecular structure and structural changes (dynamics) of nucleotides (miRNAs as well as AONs) in the living cell, and link these in-cell structures to the molecule’s targeting function. Combining existing knowledge of the host in structural and molecular biology of miRNAs with the experience in methods development in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of the experienced researcher (ER), we will develop a set of robust and reliable in-cell NMR methods to determine cellular concentration, structure and dynamics within the cell at high resolution. The scope of the method will be demonstrated on: (i) a miRNA, miR-34a, which targets more than 50 different mRNAs, related to cancer and other cellular processes, as well as (ii) an AON drug candidate in collaboration with AstraZeneca. This project will benefit drug development against various diseases and will enable the ER to contribute to solving today's health problems and develop further towards becoming a future group leader on the interface of research in academia and industry.",0,0
22,103086,Yes,Biocatalytic cascades to access valuable building blocks,"The aim of this project is to provide training in the multidisciplinary fields of organic chemistry, biocatalysis, molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology to design and develop artificial cascades by combining various types of enzymes such as L-amino acid oxidades, alcohol dehydrogenases and lyases. This is a truly competitive, innovative and timely field in which to work, and for sure the results derived from this cutting-edge project will be published in top ranked journals contributing to European Excellence.  The project is expected to make a major contribution to replace traditional chemical manufacturing which relies in highly toxic, expensive and stoichiometric reagents, many steps and toxic solvents with so-called “white biotechnology” which employs powerful natural biocatalysts such as enzymes or whole cell microorganisms that allow the combination of several steps in one-pot without isolation of intermediates (cascade reactions) establishing environmentally benign and sustainable chemical processes for the preparation of optically active valuable compounds and minimizing the wastes. The research project will be divided in three main research objectives: (i) Enzymatic cascades leading to aminoacids to hydroxyacids: Novel enantioselective routes for the preparation of enantiopure hydroxyacids, (ii) Biocatalytic cascades leading to trans-coumaric acid derivatives, (iii) Redox-neutral cascade coupling of lactate to phenol via C-C bond formation. Applications to natural product synthesis.  The optimal development of the project is guaranteed by the high quality of the host institution (University of Graz) and the supervisor (Prof. Wolfgang Kroutil). The host institution owns all the facilities and infrastructures that are required for the performance of this interdisciplinary project while Prof. Kroutil is a world-leading scientific in the field of biocatalytic cascade transformations with well established collaborations with world-class researchers.",0,1
520,196650,No,Advanced Next GEneration Landing System,"Life matters. Safety matters. Economy matters. We all acknowledge that any action leading to diminish the risk of accidents must be promoted . A special situation arises in offshore platforms, where helicopter approach and landing (A&L) operations are far from being secure (300 accidents between 2000 and 2005). More than 75% of accidents between 1975 and 2001 occurred during A&L, being most of them (66%) related with installation design (obstacles dense), and most causes related with human errors and bad weather . This project focuses on increasing safety the EU way, through an innovative use of carrier technologies encouraged by EU SESAR  program. PALU follows these guidelines to disrupt the market of A&L high precision guiding systems with a product that will make our young, ambitious and innovative StartUp the provider of reference. 90% offshore wind farms are located in Europe so we are contributing substantially to the safety of our installations and our workers. Also, O/G rigs in the North Sea lead the rate of accidents  (mostly because of bad weather), and we intent to help minimizing this rate. Apart from the human drama, there is also the strong economic impact of losing highly specialized personnel (rate of casualties is >75% when a helicopter accident occurs), helicopters ($15-$25 million on average) and cargo. Even in the absence of incidents, aborting an A&L operation has a significant economic impact (fuel, salaries, impact of cargo delayed, etc.).",0,0
632,83460,No,Design and synthesis of novel analogues of laulimalide as improved microtubule-stabilising anti-cancer agents,"Despite considerable progress in cancer treatment, there is still a need for novel chemotherapeutic agents with improved pharmacological properties, reduced side-effects and efficacy against otherwise drug-resistant cancers. Laulimalide is a highly potent antimitotic agent, isolated from marine sponges, which inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines at the low nanomolar level. By sharing the same microtubule-stabilising mechanism as TaxolÂ® and retaining activity against multidrug-resistant cancer cells, laulimalide presents a promising lead structure for the development of a new class of anti-cancer agents. In the proposed project, structurally simplified analogues of laulimalide will be designed and synthesised in order to investigate structure-activity relationships and the mechanism of action, as well as improving the chemical stability. In this context, the preferred bioactive conformation of laulimalide will be probed and the structural requirements for potent cytotoxicity explored.  The applicant will improve her research training and expand her knowledge in the synthesis of biologically active molecules with therapeutic potential, at the same time participating in multidisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry, biology and medicine. Moreover, she will work on a totally different topic from her PhD studies and thus acquire new knowledge and expertise. These additional skills and complementary experiences will lead in turn to an exceptionally well-trained researcher, with enhanced profess ional maturity and independence, providing lasting long-term benefits in her future career. In addition to the high scientific standards provided by this postdoctoral research experience, the fellow would profit from the excellent infrastructure and the opportunities to interact with leading scientists & young researchers of varying disciplines and nationalities, as well as collaborations with research groups in universities & industry with balancing expertise.",0,0
50,57243,Yes,Biological effects of environmental pollution in marine coastal ecosystems (BEEP),"Biological markers allow the direct determination of pollutant impact of living organisms in aquatic systems. While new emerging biomarkers are actually under evaluation, some common markers are in a validation-phase and may be used as assessment tools for the quality of the marine environment. The goal of this research programme is to evaluate the potential of using biological marker determined in marine organisms (fish, bivalves) as a means of assessment of chemical contamination and to investigate the socio-economic implications for certain selected zones for coastal communities dependent from marine resources. Different types of coastal European environments (Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Sea) will be investigated by the participants who will co-operate on the three selected environments through a long term study",0,1
874,37805,No,Energy absorbing materials for low impact forces,"Safety of transportation vehicles, especially passenger cars, has to meet permanently increasing demands. Developments in active and passive security systems in vehicles have already led to high standards. Nevertheless weak points are still passenger as well as the pedestrian protection in various crash situations.  Besides passenger protection also the safety of 'weaker' traffic participants like bikers and children possibly being involved in accidents with cars has to be improved. So there is a vital necessity for the development of energy absorbing structures and materials not only to meet legal regulations on e.g. side impact, head impact or pedestrian protection (by so called 'soft noses'). For this reason the energy absorption potential of cellular structures made from various materials have to be investigated and evaluated. The materials properties will be analysed with respect to the transferability of their behaviour in a component respectively a completed car.  Additionally to the analysis of existing structures materials modelling and simulation procedures for energy absorption behaviour will be developed enabling the tailoring of cellular structures with applicationally optimised properties profiles.  At the end of the project duration it will be possible to react quickly on new safety demands. New basic properties data and improved modelling and simulation tools as well as adequate testing methods will enable a quick development of components with optimised energy absorption properties.  All possible applications mentioned in this project have to work under low impact torces. This means in comparison to structural energy absorption in a car (deformation of frame elements) the energy level is in the range of 0.1 to 1 kJ related to a 100 x 100 x 100 mm3 test specimen.  The working programme can be devided in five major working packages: 1 Screening of available materials and methods  2 Materials production and optimisation  3 Functional relation of material properties and energy absorption data  4 Mathematical numerical description of the material behaviour, modelling and simulation  5 Verification on typical components  Innovative aspects:   A decisive degree of innovation will be the development of foams respectivelycellular materials structures with ideal force  displacement characteristics. Those materials will have a steep force gain, a regulated deformation force level (crush strength) respecting the safety requirements e.g. for head impact, hip, thorax, legs, shoulders and others. Additionally they will have a maximised deformation length (> 80 %) before the required strength level is exceeded.   The development will end up in an optimised cellular material with adequate production processes concerning also minimised masses (lightweight) and environmental aspects.   Test methods are standardised and the procedures will be comparable.Modelling of foams and other cellular materials is enabling  behaviour simulation under dynamic load (crash) without a reference of an existing material.   Decisive impact on 'safety design'.   Social aspects:   * Improved safety design will reduce the heaviness of injuries and thus reduce the subsequent medical and social expenditures.",0,0
850,209362,No,"Innovative sol-gel strategies for the production of homogeneous, hydrothermally stable, and porous mixed metal oxide catalysts for biomass conversion applications","The project is focused on the preparation, characterization and application of (hydro)thermally stable, homogeneous, and porous metallosilicate catalysts. As a synthetic route we will apply non-hydrolytic sol-gel routes since they produce materials with high homogeneity and they allow the one-step functionalization of the oxides surface. We will focus and demonstrate our results primarily on the synthesis of alumosilicates, and then broaden the work to Zr-, Ti-, Nb-, and Ta-doped silicates. We will use advanced analytic techniques for the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts – infrared spectroscopy, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, nitrogen and ammonia adsorption-desorption experiments, electron microscopy, powder x-ray diffraction, small angle x-ray scattering, and surface analytical techniques – time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We will evaluate our materials as catalysts in alcohol dehydration. For this type of reaction it is desirable to have hydrothermally stable acidic material. Hydrothermal instability is usually the main drawback of mixed metal oxides. Therefore we will tune the hydrophobicity of prepared materials and their surfaces by introduction of various organic groups in order to improve their performances. We will focus on the control of the pore size distribution as well and prepare stable and homogeneous materials with large pores applicable in catalytic actions on bulky (bio)molecules. In such a way the project will establish fruitful cooperation between the two research groups – one focused primarily on the synthetic pathways to novel materials and the second focused on their application in heterogeneous catalysis. The fellow will learn new characterization techniques and catalytic testing under industrially-relevant conditions. He will work independently, attain new soft skills and will prepare for the establishing of new research group back in Brno.",0,0
940,194044,No,SME Instrument for Innovative Companies from Latvia,"The overall objective of the project is to contribute to smart growth in the European Union by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in research, development and innovation and by contributing to a better and more efficient connection of actors along the innovation chain. To achieve this objective the following measures are foreseen: • To support SMEs, as the beneficiaries of the SME Instrument to identify bottlenecks to the creation of economic impact in companies benefitting from grants by Horizon2020's SME instrument and address these bottlenecks with the help of capable coaches; • To increase the efficiency and effectiveness of innovation processes in small and medium sized enterprises with significant innovation activities that could potentially become beneficiaries of European support to research and innovation but would not have effective access to consulting services for innovation management. In practice at least six (6) specialised 7-day service packages will be delivered to SMEs to assist them in successful participation in the SME Instrument  programme under Horizon 2020 and increase their innovation management capacity beyond this programme.

1031,92346,No,Cooperative Communications with Confidential Messages,"'In comparison to the conventional wireless communication systems, the future ones will be decentralized, ad-hoc in nature allowing different mobile terminals to join and leave. While designing such systems an important aspect is the confidentiality of the data exchanged among trusted network nodes. Recent results show that significant performance improvements could be achieved by allowing cooperation among the network nodes. The possibility to collaborate in a wireless environment makes the whole system vulnerable and susceptible to attacks. The primary topic of the proposed research is to explore the information theoretic limits in wireless networks where nodes can cooperate while exchanging confidential messages. In order to protect the transmitted information, classical systems exchange encryption keys over separate channels. In the wireless ad-hoc scenario this approach will be extremely challenging. Information theory offers tools to design codes that maximize the useful rate while minimizing the 'leak' rate of confidential information to unwanted users. The advantage is that everything could be done through the same channel, i.e. there is no need of separate channels to exchange keys. The project will also focus on exploring the possibility of the combined (hybrid) scenario where the current cellular infrastructure is used such that mobile users have the possibility to choose between peer-to-peer transmission and transmission via a base station or an access point. The design of such systems will improve the performances of the current systems and will open new possibilities for various applications.'",0,0
124,23027,Yes,Durable binders from renewable sources for paints and coastings in the building industry,"As a consequence of growing awareness of sustainability and durabi-lity, as mentioned in governmental policies, the use of renewable materials in general and paints from renewable sources in particular must be stimulated. From recent developments, carried out by Verffabriek RIGO b.v. it was demonstrated that relatively durable, waterbased paints could be prepared according to this concept, using emulsions of linseedoil/-standoil as the binder and natural, inert pigments as colorants. It is the main goal of this research-proposal to study and eliminate the two drawbacks found, namely the relatively slow physically drying of stand-oil based binders along with the limited outdoor durability on wood in the building industry of the pure, unmodified oils. From the mentioned developments a number of proposals came up to realise good performing coatings by minor chemical adaptations of the linseed-oil, soya-oil and tall-oil standoils. Cooking of those oils with natural double bond functionality or functionalty from the chemical industry have shown to give very realistic possibilities to solve said technical problems in binder application in paints and coatings for especially woodstructures in the building industry. Also from studied literature sound ideas were found to solve the mentioned drawbacks.  Cooperation with expertise from the chemical, -binder production-industry is a necessity to realise mentioned goals, as the paint industry as such is not capable to chemically modify the natural and renewable oils. On the other hand, those binder-producers needs very close cooperation with the paint producers to create optimal perfor-ming and durable paints for protective and decorative purposes.",1,1
154,92902,Yes,High added value materials from waste tyre gasification residues,"This project is focused on the waste tyres recycling and promotes a thermal process mainly devoted to the production of ceramic materials. The disposal of waste tyres represents a relevant problem within the waste management strategy of the European Community and, despite the attempts of reusing waste tyre in many different ways, a relevant fraction (nearly 23%) is still landfilled. Pyrolysis and gasification are a promising way for alternative high-efficiency material and energy production, since both the processes provide a gaseous and a liquid fraction easily usable as fuels or chemical sources. Nevertheless, besides these encouraging preliminary remarks, the experiences on both pilot and industrial scale have shown that without a valuable exploitation of the solid by-product (char), the whole economic balance of the process is not advantageous and therefore the process is not sustainable. The gasification/pyrolysis treatment of waste tyres, apart from a high hydrogen rich syngas, brings to a very high carbon-rich char fraction, which has been tested in the past as a semi-reinforcing filler for new tyres or as an active carbon. Nevertheless, despite the recent technological advances, it is still unclear whether there is a market demand for this product. On these bases, the main idea of the proposal consists in redirecting the gasification process towards the material recycling, by coupling a second thermal process, dedicated to the plasma synthesis of silicon carbide, to the preliminary waste tyres gasification. The overall strategy of the project’s workplan mainly consists of three levels: a.the development of a sustainable recycling process for the waste tyre treatments, with the final construction of a prototype plant; b.the sustainability assessment, in terms of impact analyses on economical, ecological and social aspects; c.the market requirements analysis and the future perspectives in view of potential stakeholders, and the diffusion of the results.",1,1
191,67208,Yes,Three step fermentation of solid state biowaste for biogas production and sanitation (3A-BIOGAS),"Objectives and problems to be solved: In Europe renewable energy (RE) in solid state biowaste is an area with considerable unused potential. Biogas produced out of this biowaste can be applied for fuelling gas turbines in CHP plants or fuel cells. Available kinds of such dry biowaste include municipal solid waste (MSW), separately collected biowaste, waste from the food industry, garden and horticultural waste, material harvested from areas left fallow, etc.  The most used method for treating these wastes is conventional composting: Compost is produced by aerobic degradation with loss of heat to the atmosphere. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of liquid materials below 15% dry matter (DM) is widely used and technologies for this application are well established. Treatment of solid state materials in conventional biogas plants has several disadvantages associated with the large amount of process water required: there is a high energy demand for heating and pumping the process water and sometimes for pressing the digested material. At the end of the process wastewater must be treated.  3A-BIOGAS is a combination of aerobic and anaerobic processing in three steps: 1. aerobic, 2. anaerobic, 3. aerobic. The process generates biogas from solid state biomass (30-70% DM) and therefore uses the energy capacity of the biowaste. The innovative percolation water management avoids further wastewater. Sanitation will take place within the 1st step, further sanitation, deodorisation and final rotting in the 3rd step. The produced compost is predicted to meet the maturation and hygienic requirements of EU Working Document an biowaste treatment /1.1/. It can be used for fertilising and soil improvement.  Biogas production as liquid process is mainly addressing the agricultural waste treatment industry. Biogas plants in the primary agricultural sector in the EU are predominantly in the hands of SMEs (amounts to more than 3 GW). Over 80% of this potential is located in the smaller capacity range below 200 kW electric power. By implementation of 3A-BIOGAS process the respective SMEs could increase the treatment capacity and in consequence their income. 3A-BIOGAS therefore aims at the development to series production of a modular batch system for dry fermentation in the smaller capacity range. In addition to existing liquid fermentation plants with biogas utilisation the installation of a 3A-BIOGAS process as a second treatment line for solid input substrates will lead to several synergies for SME endusers.  Description of work: The main R&D steps, which have to be tackled in the 3A-BIOGAS project are organised in four phases: - Phase 1: Requirement Engineering; - Phase 2: System Development; - Phase 3: Prototype Manufacturing & Test; - Phase 4: Socio-Economic Assessment.  These phases are split into major work packages, which are further detailed in tasks and activities where appropriate. The following list gives an overview on the individual work packages: WP1: Enduser Requirement Specification; WP2: 3A Process Development; WP3: Design and Manufacturing of Two Prototype Units; WP4: Test of Two Prototype Units; WP5: Socio-Economic Assessment. Additionally there are separate work packages for Project Management (WP0) and Dissemination and Preparation of Exploitation (WP6), which accompany the project. The figure below shows the flow diagram for the 3A-BIOGAS project.  Expected results and exploitation plans: Within 3A-BIOGAS, two prototype plants will be manufactured and tested under industrial conditions at two different locations in Europe. The time-to-market for this new three-step batch system should not exceed 6 - 12 months after the end of the project, when the most relevant measures resulting from technical and final assessment are considered. Since the tests will be carried out in two different European states, the results will be effectively promoted and disseminated and relevant support for the market entry of the technology is given.",1,1
1001,80143,No,Promote Confidence in Future Information Technologies for the Valorisation of European Research Infrastructures,"While plenty of commercial test solutions exist on the market to address complex telecom protocols, these solutions are used to implement proprietary test solutions and are in all cases very expensive (e.g. more than 2 millions euros for a GSM test system).  All the important experience in telecom testing products has however forced organisations such as industrial fora (ATM forum, Bluetooth SIG, etc) or standards organisations (i.e. ETSI, 3GPP) to work on optimised test methodologies and also process optimisation approaches to cope with heavy workloads over the past years to build the single market. Positive outcomes can then be identified as major EU strengths: strong testing culture and solid experience in test suites and test tool development. The GO4IT project will provide a generic low cost test environment and associated test services, together with free of charge executable test suites, targeting IPv6 focused protocol testing. The Go4IT project will permit to capitalize on large European investments made in infrastructures by giving the tools to all user communities to test IPv6 protocol based solutions thus increasing their trust and confidence in new generation infrastructures. One of the main objectives of Go4IT is to foster the community engagement in adopting a test and validation approach. Adapted service activities, supported by an open community web portal and an appropriate networking with other IPv6 and test related initiatives will further enlarge this user community.

131,227656,Yes,Modeling Prey Isocapes in the North Atlantic for Advancement in Predator Ecology,"The immensity of the oceans makes it difficult to monitor them at a spatio-temporal scale that is relevant for resolving ecological processes and responses to decades of pressure from multiple anthropological stressors. With IsoMod, I aim to map the biogeochemical tracers (stable isotope (SI) composition) at the base of the food web to inform three key measures of marine ecosystem processes that might be affected by these stressors: productivity, food web structure and animal migration pathways. The isoscapes will be developed at the scale of the North Atlantic Ocean and will be based on Calanus spp. carbon and nitrogen SI values, δ13C and δ15N. Lipid rich zooplankton organisms such as C. finmarchicus fuel a large part of the higher trophic level in the North Atlantic, including many species of fish, birds and mammals. I will use a recently developed spatial statistic approach where high resolution observational data (e.g., satellite data) are applied as predictors of SI variability, and apply these models to produce isoscapes with a full coverage of the study area. The application of these isoscapes will be showcased in two case studies. The first will test the role of changes in Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) winter diet in key life-history parameters (e.g., body condition, survival rate). Specifically, the isoscapes will be used to provide the trophic baseline needed to investigate changes in puffin trophic position associated with changes in diet. The second case study will use prey SI to improve forecast of Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) summer distribution. Variation in SI values can be linked to variation in secondary productivity and this will be used to identify best foraging conditions for mackerel ahead of their migration to the summer feeding grounds. This information will be investigated as a driver of mackerel summer distribution and their recent shift in distribution.",0,1
57,58660,Yes,"Heat, abrasion, and corrosion tolerant construction materials for food processing machinery","The selection of construction materials for machinery in the food industry is therefore difficult since the materials not only have to fulfil the high technical demands but must also conform to valid laws and restrictions. A common problem for the food-processing industry is therefore any parts of the machinery which may cause contamination of the products with abrasives, particles, fibres etc. This danger exists especially for mechanically stressed parts such as bearings in extruders, heaters, screw pumps, mixers, kneaders, and continuous churns or packaging machines. In the past, such machinery contained bearings made from mineral and/or glass fibre composite naturals.

679,195513,No,Analysis of sugar- and osmo-signalling mechanisms in cell wall integrity maintenance,"Cell walls provide plant cells with structural support during growth and differentiation as well as with protection against environmental stress. Cell wall composition and structure is adapted to these functional requirements by a dedicated mechanism to maintain cell wall integrity (CWI). The available evidence suggests that the CWI mechanism is an important regulator of cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism and that signalling of sugar levels and osmotic conditions is vital for its function. Furthermore, interdependencies between pathogen defence and the CWI mechanism are becoming apparent. By performing a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis, I will identify novel components involved in sugar-signalling in the context of CWI maintenance and pathogen defence. Using a combination of genetic mapping and next-generation sequencing, I will determine the identity of the components, whose specific activities will be identified through targeted functional analyses. In the second part of my project I will determine functions of the signalling metabolites trehalose-6-phosphate and glycerol-3-phophate in CWI maintenance and analyse the osmo-sensitive regulation of these functions. After characterizing time-dependent quantitative changes in metabolite levels and related enzyme activities upon impaired CWI and in combination with osmotic support, I will examine specific functions of metabolites / enzymes by analysing developmental, hormonal and structural responses in Arabidopsis overexpression and knockout lines.  This project takes advantage of CWI maintenance involvement in a variety of biological processes to identify signalling components and osmo-sensitive mechanisms for the coordination of carbohydrate metabolism with cell wall metabolism and pathogen defence. The knowledge generated in this project will provide novel functional insights into metabolic processes relevant for facilitating bioenergy production and increasing the yield of food crops.",0,0
846,210551,No,Adaptive Actin Architectures,"Although we have extensive knowledge of many important processes in cell biology, including information on many of the molecules involved and the physical interactions among them, we still do not understand most of the dynamical features that are the essence of living systems. This is particularly true for the actin cytoskeleton, a major component of the internal architecture of eukaryotic cells.  In living cells, actin networks constantly assemble and disassemble filaments while maintaining an apparent stable structure, suggesting a perfect balance between the two processes. Such behaviors are called “dynamic steady states”. They confer upon actin networks a high degree of plasticity allowing them to adapt in response to external changes and enable cells to adjust to their environments. Despite their fundamental importance in the regulation of cell physiology, the basic mechanisms that control the coordinated dynamics of co-existing actin networks are poorly understood. In the AAA project, first, we will characterize the parameters that allow the coupling among co-existing actin networks at steady state. In vitro reconstituted systems will be used to control the actin nucleation patterns, the closed volume of the reaction chamber and the physical interaction of the networks. We hope to unravel the mechanism allowing the global coherence of a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Second, we will use our unique capacity to perform dynamic micropatterning, to add or remove actin nucleation sites in real time, in order to investigate the ability of dynamic networks to adapt to changes and the role of coupled network dynamics in this emergent property. In this part, in vitro experiments will be complemented by the analysis of actin network remodeling in living cells. In the end, our project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how the adaptive response of the cytoskeleton derives from the complex interplay between its biochemical, structural and mechanical properties.",0,0
384,88242,No,Asymptotic Geometric Analysis and Learning Theory,"In a typical learning problem one tries to approximate an unknown function by a function from a given class using random data, sampled according to an unknown measure. In this project we will be interested in parameters that govern the complexity of a learning problem. It turns out that this complexity is determined by the geometry of certain sets in high dimension that are connected to the given class (random coordinate projections of the class). Thus, one has to understand the structure of these sets as a function of the dimension - which is given by the cardinality of the random sample. The resulting analysis leads to many theoretical questions in Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, Probability (most notably, Empirical Processes Theory) and Combinatorics, which are of independent interest beyond the application to Learning Theory. Our main goal is to describe the role of various complexity parameters involved in a learning problem, to analyze the connections between them and to investigate the way they determine the geometry of the relevant high dimensional sets. Some of the questions we intend to tackle are well known open problems and making progress towards their solution will have a significant theoretical impact. Moreover, this project should lead to a more complete theory of learning and is likely to have some practical impact, for example, in the design of more efficient learning algorithms.",0,0
828,99006,No,The contribution of Civil Society Organizations to representative democracy in the EU,"'The proposed study will address how Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) contribute to non-electoral representation in the EU. The theoretical perspective chosen is based on the assumption that representation is a sine qua non for the legitimacy of any democratic political system. This constitutes a novel research area for which there is to date no theoretical discourse and no empirical research. We don't know who is actually represented (and who is not) through CSOs in European governance, on the ground of which mandate and with which forms of accountability, how claims-making by CSOs works across governance levels, and thereby how we can think of democratic representation in the context of undefined constituencies beyond the nation state. The topic is highly relevant given the attention that CSOs have received in the context of the widely perceived “democratic deficit” of the EU as a means of democratization of EU politics and given the increasing influence that non-electoral actors exert in contemporary politics. The fellowship will allow the applicant to close this important research gap in a theoretically highly innovative way, with the help and regular feedback of two very renowned scholars and the larger, international research group that work at Exeter (UK). Placed in an ideal institutional environment, through regular supervision, presentations, both local and at international conferences, and skill courses offered at the host institution, it will allow the applicant to make a decisive step in her career and towards professional independence (professorship) by offering the opportunity to a) fine-tune her theoretical approach, complete her research and draft a monographic study both of which could not be achieved in a reasonable time frame in her present situation, b) improve her complementary skills, particularly successful project management, development of larger collaborative research projects, drafting of funding proposals, and mastery of English'",0,0
494,194271,No,Secure Enclaves for REactive Cloud Applications,"Cloud security is of immediate concern to organisations that must comply with strict confidentiality and integrity policies. More broadly, security has emerged as a commercial imperative for cloud computing across a wide range of markets. The lack of adequate security guarantees is becoming the primary barrier to the broad adoption of cloud computing. The Secure Enclaves for REactive Cloud Applications (SERECA) project aims to remove technical impediments to secure cloud computing, and thereby encourage greater uptake of cost-effective and innovative cloud solutions in Europe. It proposes to develop secure enclaves, a new technique that exploits secure commodity CPU hardware for cloud deployments, empowering applications to ensure their own security without relying on public cloud operators. Secure enclaves additionally support regulatory-compliant data localisation by allowing applications to securely span multiple cloud data centres. Although secure enclaves are a general mechanism, SERECA focuses on a particularly important and rapidly growing class of applications: reactive applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), augmented reality, gaming, computer-mediated social interaction, and the like. These applications are highly interactive, data intensive, and distributed, often involving extremely sensitive societal and personal information. SERECA is validating its results through the development of two innovative and challenging industry-led use cases. One concerns the monitoring of a civil water supply network, a critical infrastructure targeted by malicious attacks. The other concerns a commercial software-as-a-service (SaaS) application for analysing the performance of cloud-deployed applications. Such a service collects sensitive performance metrics about live usage, assets that must be protected from industrial espionage and other criminal activities.",0,0
3,193428,Yes,RESEARCH ON EFFICIENT INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF COMPLEX PARTS BASED ON UNIDIRECTIONAL TAPES FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE AND AERONAUTICAL,"More and more industrial sectors are demanding high performance composite materials to face new challenges demanded by the transport sector. Carbon and glass fibre unidirectional continuous tape reinforced composites are one of the most promising options. It would be reasonable to expect that the manufacturing methods to obtain composite parts made of this hybrid material will be capable to tailor-made and optimize even more the advantageous properties given by the tapes nature. However, at the moment, these technologies are not mature enough for a full industrial implementation. Main existing barriers are related to the high consumption of resources, lower rates of automation, high production of defective and the subsequent growth of the manufacturing costs.  FORTAPE aims to solve these drawbacks through the development of an efficient and optimized integrated system for the manufacturing of complex parts based on unidirectional fibre tapes for its application in the automotive and aeronautical industry, with the minimum use of materials and energy. To achieve this objective, three main routes for fibre impregnation will be researched to manufacture the unidirectional carbon and glass fibre tapes: novel heating up technologies, melted supercritical fluid-aided thermoplastic polymers and fluidized bed of powders. Novel combination of process-machine approaches will be applied in overmoulding and in-situ consolidation to manufacture the composite parts for the targeted sectors. Novel mathematical modelling and computational simulation concepts will be developed to support the structural optimization and the failure prevention and new instrumentation strategies for process control will be implemented for the selection of the best process.  The FORTAPE consortium, led by CTAG, gathers 10 partners from 5 different European countries, and covers the whole value chain needed to develop new composite technologies with efficient use of materials and energy.",1,1
889,93192,No,Innovative Nanostructured Optochemical Sensors,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH’s) and VOCs like benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) are compounds of great social and environmental significance, are widely used in industry, in many different applications. However, they and can present serious medical, environmental, and explosion dangers. Because they are toxic even at parts per- billion concentrations, it is essential to know their concentration in the air, especially in industrial and populated areas. Measurement of these toxic compounds at trace levels in multi analyte mixtures is still a challenging task however, and involves the use of expensive laboratory bound equipment. This severely limits risk analysis and timely initiation of preventive measures in a working environment. The main objective of the INGENIOUS project is the development, evaluation and validation of novel ultra-sensitive and selective nanostructured optochemical sensors for the detection of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) from complex mixtures. Within the sensor concept, nanoparticle-based materials with high selectivity and sensitivity will be created by combining principles of molecular imprinting and plasmonic enhancement of molecular fluorescence. Silica and polymer core-shell nanoparticles with molecularly imprinted shells will be used as building blocks of self-assembling colloidal aggregates acting as chemosensing elements. The sensing elements and microarrays of sensing elements will be obtained using modern printing technologies such as ink-jet and microcontact printing. The combined sensor elements will be implemented on a polymer foil format and validated as sensor transducers. The technology will be incorporated into an in-plane optical read-out platform and demonstrated for specific end user applications. The suggested approach will be used to create sensor devices capable of detecting relevant analytes in industrial processes, occupational health and plants safety like PAH",0,0

332,194980,No,Highly Ordered Light-manipulators by Self-assembly,"The application of photonics in both everyday life and advanced science would be widespread, as they have a range of advantages as compared to electronics in many applications. However, the development of high-throughput photonic technologies has proven problematic, due to the absence of easily-scalable methods to process materials of the desired optical characteristics. My project addresses that problem by adopting a highly successful approach hat has been employed in (opto)electronics, which has led to the explosion of a new prolific scientific field, new technologies, and new products: the development of solution-based processing methods. Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the photonics field through the employment of the Dynamic Templating Process (DTP), an elegant, fully solution-processing method, which exploits the self-assembly of water microdroplets, to create micro-honeycombs, i.e. 2D photonic crystals. As solution-processable material, I propose to use an organic:inorganic hybrid, which shows refractive indexes above 2. Then, I aim to create novel 2D hierarchical and 3D photonic structures based on thy hybrid honeycombs for optical field management. In the last stage I will transform the DTP into an industrially scalable process for photonic crystal and device manufacturing. Thereby, I propose an ambitious, multidisciplinary and self-consistent project, which encompasses the synthesis of novel materials, the development of microprocessing methods, the production and characterisation of a new class of photonic elements, and the development of industrial production processes. Hence, the project is designed to generate new knowledge as well as new disruptive technology, as it may lay the foundations for next generation photonic devices",0,0
308,97005,No,The Entertainization of Childhood: An Etiology of Risks and Opportunities,"Never before has media entertainment been so abundantly accessible to children. In this project, I propose an entirely new theoretical model to understand entertainment processing and effects. The model enables us to simultaneously investigate: (a) how and why certain types of media entertainment may influence certain children, (b) which children are particularly susceptible to positive, which to negative, and which to both positive and negative entertainment effects, and (c) how children s social environment can maximize positive and minimize negative entertainment effects on children. The project involves a longitudinal panel study among 900 Dutch families. To measure the variables in the model, we will use some well-established survey instruments and neuropsychological tests. We will also employ two less conventional methods (coded media-use diaries and experience sampling methods) that may enhance serendipity in the development of our theory-advancing insights. We will use state-of-the art data-analytic techniques (e.g., multi-level and latent-growth curve modelling) to analyse the data. Although adventurous, this transdisciplinary project, the first in its kind, has great theoretical significance. If the assumptions of my model are supported, it may lead to a fundamental re-evaluation of earlier media-effects theories and research on children. The project will also have tremendous social relevance, not only for parents, but also for programme makers, educators, and the society as a whole. After all, only if we truly understand why, how, and which children are influenced by certain types of media entertainment, are we able to adequately target prevention and intervention strategies at these children.",0,0
369,98364,No,Stimuli Responsive Polymer Nanotubes by Initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition,"One dimensional nanotubular structures have a wide range of applications due to their unique physical and chemical properties that are different from the bulk materials. Metal and semiconductor nanotubes are being used as sensors, optoelectronic devices or transistors. Furthermore, polymeric nanotubes have great potential as biomedical devices due to the biocompatible nature of the polymers used. However, they are not as widely studied due to the difficulty of fabricating the nanotubular structures using common thin film deposition techniques. In this research, we propose to use initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD) to fabricate polymer nanotubes. iCVD technique has been shown to successfully deposit polymer thin films while keeping the chemical moieties of the monomers intact. Furthermore, the crosslinking density and the wall thickness of the nanotubes can easily be tuned using iCVD as opposed to other techniques, such as solution-based techniques where the polymer should be soluble. Our proposal aims to develop nanocarrier systems of polymer nanotubes for various potential applications. A wide range of stimuli responsive polymers (SRP) will be used to fabricate the nanotubes and the mechanical and response characteristics of these nanostructures as a function of crosslinking density will be explored. In the next stage, coaxial nanotubes with both layers made of SRPs will be fabricated and the effects of the interaction between the layers on the release mechanism will be studied. The results of these studies will help us better understand the dominant mechanisms during uptake and release and thus enable us to fabricate the nanocarriers according to the response desired. Furthermore, these nanotubes with improved performance will have significant impact as drug delivery systems or sensors.",0,0
571,209484,No,Epigenomics and chromosome architecture one cell at a time,"In Eukaryotes, cellular identity and tissue-specific functions are linked to the epigenetic landscape and the multi-scale architecture of the genome. The packing of DNA into nucleosomes at the ~100 bp scale and the organization of whole chromosomes into functional territories within the nucleus are well documented. At an intermediate scale, chromosomes are organised in megabase to sub-megabase structures called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). Critically, TADs are highly correlated to patterns of epigenetic marks determining the transcriptional state of the genes they encompass. Until now, the lack of efficient technologies to map chromosome architecture and epigenetic marks at the single-cell level have limited our understanding of the molecular actors and mechanisms implicated in the establishment and maintenance of the multi-scale architecture of chromosomes and epigenetic states, and the interplay between this architecture and other nuclear functions such as transcription. The overall aim of EpiScope is to unveil the functional, multi-scale, 3D architecture of chromatin at the single-cell level while preserving cellular context, with a toolbox of groundbreaking high-performance microscopies (Hi-M). Hi-M will use unique combinations of multi-focus and single-molecule localization microscopies with novel DNA labeling methods and microfluidics. Hi-M will enable the study of structure-function relationships within TADs of different chromatin types and correlate single-cell variations in epigenomic patterns to 3D conformations with genomic specificity and at the nanoscale. Finally, Hi-M will be used to develop a novel high-throughput, high-content method to unveil the full pairwise distance distribution between thousands of genomic loci at the single cell level and at multiple length-scales. Our findings and technologies will shed new light into the mechanisms responsible for cellular memory, identity and differentiation.",0,0
374,48169,No,New functional biopolymer-natural fibre-composites from agricultural resources,"New highly functional fiber reinforced composite materials (at least 2) will be developed, based on natural fibers and thermoplastics from renewable agroindustrial resources. These composite materials will be chosen from 5 different fibers combined with 4 sorts of matrices. Additional combinations are investigated by modifying both fibers and matrix materials based on starch and proteins.    The overall aim of this project is to provide at least one demonstration part made of suitable composite material for automotive application. The automotive industry is playing a leading role in innovative material development. The experience with new biocomposites in those applications will therefore be used as door-opener to step into other markets. The ,,biocomposite'-demonstration part(s) will be manufactured on a pre-competitive level to show the potential of such materials.    It is planed to deliver additional parts such as geotextiles and soil anchors in landscape application. The necessary process technology for materials treatment and demonstration part manufacturing will be adapted and/or improved in order to obtain material and prototype part properties which are competitive to commercial glass fiber reinforced polymers. Emphasis is put on the quality of materials, parts and manufacturing. All results on quality will be monitored and assessed at all different stages within the given product chain. As both fibers and matrix materials are obtained from renewable resources the composites and the demonstration parts will provide biodegradability as an additional stand alone criteria opening up new applications (e.g. Triggerable biodegradation for well-defined product life) and additional waste management possibilities (as composting). Biodegradability will be assessed with standard tests and more sophisticated methods which are to be developed within this project. The ecological impact of these new biocomposites and their economical asset in terms of expected costs will be evaluated by means of a complete life cycle analysis.",1,0
357,84897,No,Jena initiative of applying molecular techniques for the analysis of variations of ecological processes in space,"JEN-A-MACE is an inter-disciplinary project with the objective to develop a new area of competence at the Institute of Ecology (IOE) at the University of Jena that allows integrating the ecological consequences of spatial structure into models at various scales. The IOE seeks to complement its expertise at the interface between microbial ecology, animal ecology, and mathematics by recruiting experienced researchers trained in state-of-the-art molecular techniques and inverse modeling.  The scientific objectives of JEN-A-MACE are - to develop molecular expertise in analyzing microbial populations with stable isotope probing; - to establish PCR-based microsatellite techniques for analyzing the population structure of insects and mammals; - to develop modeling approaches for the analysis of ecological consequences of spatial structure within animal and microbial populations. Thus, JEN-A-MACE links molecular knowledge across disciplines and dimensions by investigating local changes in microbial diversity, genetic input of dispersers in metapopulations, and constructing spatially explicit models.  Since progress in biology demands molecular techniques, the establishment of this competence will expand the excellent standing of the IOE to successfully compete internationally. To achieve these objectives, JEN-A-MACE will bring young researchers to Germany, especially to Thuringia, an area of Europe isolated from the EU until 1989. Temporal overlap of the four experienced researchers will maximize the input of expertise into the existing groups.  The tools and synergies developed in JEN-A-MACE will be made available to others for research training and knowledge transfer in environmental sciences. While already strong in community and theoretical ecology, the establishment of molecular tools along with mathematics allows the IOE to launch itself as centre of competence for evaluating consequences of spatial structure to play a leading role in this evolving field.",0,0
215,199239,Yes,Automated real-time production forecasting for industry,"'Workshop managers face daily the challenge to execute their production plans at the lowest product rejection rates and costs. Rejections can be due to multiple kinds of defects in the manufactured piece. Each kind of defect is co-related to the particular parameters of production and the surrounding environment that have converged during the manufacturing process of the defective piece. At modern workshops the number of converging parameters during production can range from several hundreds to thousands. In serial production, defects are more prevalent at the beginning of the production of each new reference, until all production parameters are correctly set-up, but it’s also frequent to suffer involuntary, environmental or unavoidable modifications of parameters that also cause defective production.The problem of defective production is particularly relevant the higher the value of the workpieces produced and the shorter the production series. The evolution of the industrial production worldwide, and specially in advanced economies like Europe, tend towards a higher customization of products, thus to shorter series of higher cost and value pieces, making the problem of defective production a increasingly relevant issue for the competitiveness of industry.VEIGALAN has developed WORKSHOP4.0, a tool based on big data and artificial intelligence technologies that forecasts in real time the optimum working conditions for production processes involving material melting or fluency. WORKSHOP4.0 is capable to forecast the optimum production parameters at the beginning of a new series and re-calculate the new optimum parameters when unexpected, even un-noticed, defect producing events happen.'

975,201313,No,Characterization of the anaerobic degradation of phenanthrene by a novel sulfate-reducing enrichment culture for the development of bioremediation methods,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely distributed contaminants that produce hazardous effects on human health. They are persistent in the environment and recalcitrant to degradation, rendering the development of efficient PAH-removal methods a worldwide concern. In PAH-contaminated aquifers or sediments, oxygen is depleted very rapidly, thus microorganisms able to use these compounds as a carbon source in the absence of molecular oxygen are crucial for their consumption. The aim of this project is to elucidate the enzymes and mechanisms for the anaerobic degradation of phenanthrene by a novel sulfate-reducing enrichment culture. The first objective is to identify the organisms responsible for phenanthrene degradation. A phylogenetic characterization will be performed by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes amplified from the enrichment culture. The second objective is to discover the enzymes involved in the degradation process. To this end, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic evaluation of the enrichment culture will be performed. The functionality of the identified enzymes will be then evaluated in vitro. The chemical stability and complicated structure of phenanthrene promises the discovery of novel types of enzymatic reactions. Finally, the microorganisms responsible for phenanthrene degradation will be purified to homogeneity and characterized to evaluate the optimal environmental conditions for growth and phenanthrene degradation. Options to improve biodegradation at contaminated sites and to promote phenanthrene removal will be studied. The project proposes insights into the anaerobic biodegradation of three-ring PAHs as one of the most prominent classes of environmental contaminants.",0,0

The main objective of InnoWEE is in fact the development of an optimized reuse of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) materials producing high add value prefabricated insulating and radiating panels to be used in energy efficient buildings.  The proposal is based on:  1) Recovery, selection and disassembling of CDW that will be characterized and eventually treated to yield suitable raw materials to be used for production of prefabricated components. 2) Development of new high performance prefabricated insulating geopolymeric panels for building walls envelopes and radiating panels for indoor wall and ceilings with low environmental impact, low embodied energy, low CO2 emissions, high thermal performance. Panels will be fabricated recycling cement, bricks, mortars, glass and wood reaching at least 30% of CDW. 3) To install the panels in demo sites characterized by different climate to evaluate their performance in terms of reducing energy use and minimizing environmental impacts.  4) To use an integrated design process and a holistic approach for the whole life cycle of the materials and components and produce a material that is cost effective, competitive, robust, reliable and low maintenance. 5) To create practical and sustainable building solutions that are easy to integrate into building designs, easy to install, take in consideration the needs of the stakeholders that strongly influence the market, and have been tested to meet all the current standards.",1,1
20,98441,Yes,Novel on-line composting monitoring system,"Composting represents a sustainable solution for the treatment of organic waste, whatever its origin, however the economic returns of composting could be increased by improving the quality of the final product. The starting waste material from farms is more homogeneous and has a higher percentage of organic waste than household recycled waste. To this end, the final quality of the compost could be sufficiently high for use as a fertilizer not only on the farm where it has been produced, but also for its commercialisation. To achieve this, the production process needs to be well controlled. While the main biological and chemical parameters affecting the composting process are well known, the technological solutions available for monitoring and controlling the process are very limited. The present COMPO-BALL project will develop an on-line wireless system for the measurement of temperature and humidity at various points in the composting material. The proposed solution consists of a set of independent sensor nodes, i.e. the nodes will not require any external connections to feed or read the sensors, and which will be encapsulated in an inert material. COMPO-BALL could also be used in other types of composting processes whereby the starting material is quite homogeneous, as is the case with sewage for example, as well as for any other biological process where monitoring is essential, i.e. grain fermentation. Furthermore, we envisage this novel system as a starting point to extend this organic composting monitoring technology to monitoring the composting of household recycled waste. This would allow for a higher economic return, and smaller composting plants could be considered. Smaller composting plants could be located closer to the urban nucleus, which would reduce transport costs.",1,1
172,91570,Yes,New bioreactor for aerobic fermentation processes,"The research aims at development of a new fermentor concept. In 1985 one of our collaborators patented a pumped tubular loop reactor: HIPERLOOP.

Especially for viscous media where oxygen transfer is very low, HIPERLOOP is expected to increase the volumetric productivity and thereby reduce energy use and cost price considerably.  Disadvantage at that time was the impossibility to recycle cells from the reactor in a cost effective way. Our research aims to integrate the two technologies and will take advantage of new developments in cell-recycle systems to complete the concept. The technology will be used to develop three types of processes: Lysine, Citric acid and Biopolymer fermentation. For these processes a significant cost reduction (20-50%) will be realised.",0,1
465,214016,No,The autonomous floral pathway: a WIndow to Study the tight link between non-coDing RNA and chrOMatin regulation,"My Fellowship will explore the interconnection between non-coding RNA and chromatin regulation. Building on a detailed mechanistic base, I will capitalize on the recent proteomic identification of a stable complex FLD/SDG26 by my host lab, which plays a central role in the co-transcriptional silencing of the Arabidopsis floral repressor locus FLC. This protein complex is central to a mechanism determining the quantitative expression level of FLC, and thus the reproductive strategy of the plant. However, these activities also regulate many other targets in the Arabidopsis genome and the conserved nature of the components suggests the deeper understanding gained from this study will be important generally across all eukaryotes. FLD is a histone demethylase with specificity for H3K4; SDG26 is a SET domain protein likely to methylate histones and other proteins, but whose specificity is currently unknown. The splicing and alternative processing of FLC antisense non-coding transcript, COOLAIR, is essential for the repression of FLC transcription. However, how the processing of COOLAIR controls sense transcription remains elusive. My proposal aims to: 1) test the hypothesis that the FLD/SDG26 complex, triggered by FCA/FY-mediated proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR, delivers a specific chromatin environment, which represses transcriptional output: and 2) explore the missing link between FCA/FY-mediated proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR and chromatin regulation by FLD/SDG26 complex. My proposal involves interconnections between genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology, enabling me to develop a broader experimental skillset. It directly contributes to the action’s goals to: improve my creative potential and competences through international mobility and advanced training in technical and transferable skills; enhance collaborative and contact networks for both myself and my host lab through academic and public engagement; and drive substantial career development.",0,0

Currently there is a need in automotive industry for cutting fuel consumption and thus, gas emissions. The preferred way nowadays is to do so by incorporating light car pieces, maintaining the current performance concerning security, in order to comply both with the EU legislation and consumer needs. Aluminium die casted pieces solve the problem that the automotive industry have, addressing consumers’ needs and legislation requests. #FC21S is an innovative aluminium die casting process in which a pioneer concentrated mould release agent is nebulised through micro-spraying specially designed, rendering pieces with better mechanical properties and enhanced impact resistance. The concentrated agent is used in an amount of 10 g per casted piece, instead of the 7 l per piece required with a regular mould release agent, what significantly reduces the heavily polluted waste streams, having as a consequence a cleaner and cheaper process. It is wax-free, what reduces the porosity in the aluminium casted piece, increasing its impact resistance. With this process we dramatically cut waste-streams and reduce the energy needed for the process, increasing productivity of the line. The general objective of #FC21S is to set the manufacturing line of structural car pieces built in structural aluminium and die casted with a pioneer concentrated release agent in order to contribute to making better light-weight structural car pieces, for satisfying consumers and car manufacturing industry.'",1,0

As the Magic Lounge is a meeting place for the members of a geographically distributed community, it shares with the I Connected Community Schema the aim of stimulating the sharing of knowledge and experience between people.   To demonstrate the potential of the Magic Lounge concept, its inhabitants will carry out conversation and iteratively engage in joint travel planning. The latter activity strings together a large number of sub-activities including the creation of a travel record using a common magic board, Web-based tools and information sources, purchasing visits paid to the Marketplace, learning visits paid to the Academy, distance exploration of sites, visits to people's homes etc. Magic Lounge results will be: a scaleable generic platform for inhabited information spaces; three increasingly powerful Magic Lounges; intelligent multi-party communication management mechanisms which will manage, moderate, interpret and summarise multi-input channel communication between the inhabitants of information spaces; novel methods, such as speech-operated information retrieval, for embedding third-party information services; a magic whiteboard; content-based media conversion techniques coping with participants' heterogeneous communication bandwidths; demonstration of natural human-human-system communication and negotiation in information spaces through innovative uses of speech and gesture; demonstration of co-present system moderator agents and of user delegate agents and their communicative capabilities; professionally designed demonstration of human-human-system cohabitation and co-presence in information spaces that is adequate from the points of view of functionality, realism, aesthetics and usability. So far, most computer systems have been developed for individual professional users, requiring them to train to acquire the abilities needed for operating the computer tools and largely ignoring the natural communication abilities of everybody. New developments are rapidly changing that into a situation in which everyone is becoming a computer user, benefiting from the rapidly increasing power of low-range systems, increasing communication bandwidth, networking, powerful wireless mobile systems and the proliferation of novel interactive computer hardware and peripheral devices. These developments imply a vision which the i3 initiative is bound to pursue. The vision is one of several virtually co-present, geographically distributed ordinary users communicating in natural and intuitive human ways with each other and with an all-knowing, networked computer system.  Magic Lounge is committed to demonstrating part of this vision, expecting other i3 projects to achieve complementary parts of it. A Magic Lounge is a virtual meeting place for communities of ordinary users, a 'root' information space. Visiting the Lounge, people may just chat or make new acquaintances, which contributes to the quality of life in the community. However, they may also team up to carry out joint, goal directed activity of an everyday kind, such as indulging in hobbies, discussing community issues, joint retrieving information from the Web, or visiting another inhabited information space, such as an Arena, a Market Place or an Academy.

Interpretations of Aristotle’s Cosmology Across the Ages” that has received the Seal of Excellence 2019. THEIA is a project on the paraphrase of Aristotle’s De Caelo by the 4th century rhetor and philosopher Themistius. It aims to shed light on Themistius’ presentation of the Aristotelian cosmos, that is contained chiefly in this paraphrase. Its importance in the history of Aristotelianism is beyond doubt, as it is the first complete exegesis of the De Caelo that has come down to us, but adequate study of it has been hampered by the fact that the original Greek is lost: only a medieval Hebrew version of the lost Arabic version, and in a Hebrew-into-Latin version survive. Both are edited, but the Latin is derivative, and the Hebrew text requires a new critical edition. THEIA will edit, translate into English, and comment upon the Hebrew text. Once the task accomplished, this will allow the scholars in the field to get a more complete picture of 4th century Aristotelianism. To the importance of THEIA for the history of philosophy another reason of interest should be added, that concerns the text of Aristotle. The Hebrew version allows the scholar who is conversant with Themistius’ exegetical habits to reconstruct some passages in the Greek original, and to single out the Aristotelian lemmata of the De Caelo interspersed in Themistius’ wording. The retroversion of these lemmata into Greek will provide the philologists with an extremely important piece of documentation: parts of the text of Aristotle’s De Caelo as it was read in the 4th century, i.e. five centuries before the most ancient ms of it. In this sense, THEIA can be considered an interdisciplinary project that, through the reconstruction and interpretation of a Greek work transmitted in Hebrew and Latin, paves the ground to a fruitful cooperation of philosophical and philological skills.",0,0
171,206087,Yes,"The vertical farming revolution, urban Farming as a Service.","The global population is projected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050. National populations are expected to more than double in 40 countries.  The global life expectancy is 73 years for women and 69 years for men—there are more people in the world and we are living longer. While industrial agriculture produces enough food to feed the world as a whole (2790 kcal/person/day in 2006-08), 32%  of all food produced is wasted. The logistics of food production and transportation are largely to blame although in developed countries a substantial amount of food is wasted at the point of consumption. As a result, overall global food availability is lower than it would otherwise be, requiring the planet’s agricultural system to produce additional food to compensate for the wasted food production. Consequently, The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates 795 million of the 7.3 billion people in the world, or one person in nine, suffer from chronic undernourishment.   In order to feed the population in 2050, we need to produce an additional 6,000 trillion kcal per year.  However, conventional industrial agriculture is not sustainable. It is one of the most harmful industries to our planet, responsible for: • 70% of the planet’s water use • up to 24% of greenhouse gas emissions • degradation of soil and groundwater pollution  Continual ploughing of fields, combined with heavy use of fertilizers, has degraded soils across the world to the point where arable land is now lost at the alarming rate of over 100,000 square kilometres every year, far outstripping the pace of the natural processes that replace diminished soil.

143,106537,Yes,Development of a sustainable exploitation scheme for Europe’s Rare Earth ore deposits,"With numerous European industries heavily depended on imported REE raw materials, there is a need for EU to secure a viable supply of REE minerals as well as develop from the ground up the currently non-existent European REE extraction and processing industry. The goal of the EURARE project will be (i) to characterize the potential REE resources in Europe; and (ii) to research, develop, optimize and demonstrate technologies for the efficient and economically viable exploitation of currently available European REE deposits with minimum consequences to the environment. In the EURARE project, the mineral processing technologies currently used for the REEs minerals will be investigated for representative European REE ores, with a tendency for improvement by adopting new approaches for the complete ore utilization and minimal environmental consequences, establishing integrated mineral processing systems, with zero or close to zero tailings. The current state-of-the-art processes for REE extraction follows complicated, energy and resource intensive technologies. The EURARE project aims in developing novel cost-effective and resource-efficient REE extraction process, tailored specifically for European REE ore deposits as well as for European health, safety and environmental protection standards. As an added value to the work already described, EURARE will seek to demonstrate new sources for REE exploitation from industrial metallurgical waste which will not only be financial lucrative but will minimize the overall environmental footprint of the primary European metallurgical industry. Special attention in all cases will be given in health, safety and social issues, in light of naturally occurring radioactive elements. At the end of the EURARE project it is expected that a novel sustainable exploitation schema for Europe's REE deposits will have been established",1,1

593,110236,No,Crystal Engineering for Molecular Organic Semiconductors,"'The urgent need to develop inexpensive and ubiquitous solar energy conversion cannot be overstated. Solution processed organic semiconductors can enable this goal as they support drastically less expensive fabrication techniques compared to traditional semiconductors. Molecular organic semiconductors (MOSs) offer many advantages to their more-common pi-conjugated polymer counterparts, however a clear and fundamental challenge to enable the goal of high performance solution-processable molecular organic semiconductor devices is to develop the ability to control the crystal packing, crystalline domain size, and mixing ability (for multicomponent blends) in the thin-film device geometry. The CEMOS project will accomplish this by pioneering innovative methods of “bottom-up” crystal engineering for organic semiconductors. We will employ specifically tailored molecules designed to leverage both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of molecular organic semiconductor systems to direct and control crystalline packing, promote crystallite nucleation, compatibilize disparate phases, and plasticize inelastic materials. We will demonstrate that our new classes of materials can enable the tuning of the charge carrier transport and morphology in MOS thin films, and we will evaluate their performance in actual thin-film transistor (TFT) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Our highly interdisciplinary approach, combining material synthesis and device fabrication/evaluation, will not only lead to improvements in the performance and stability of OPVs and TFTs but will also give deep insights into how the crystalline packing—independent from the molecular structure—affects the optoelectronic properties. The success of CEMOS will rapidly advance the performance of MOS devices by enabling reproducible and tuneable performance comparable to traditional semiconductors—but at radically lower processing costs.'",0,0
86,204354,Yes,"A highly innovative size recommendation engine, disrupting the existing online apparel market by using big data and machine-learning algorithms.","Fit Analytics GmbH is a Berlin-based ICT-SME, operating in the online fashion market. We are aiming to solve the two major problems of online fashion retail:  1. High return rates (~40-50%) because many end users don’t know their size. ~65% of all returns are made due to non-fit. High return rates have certain side effects, e.g. enormous CO2 emissions. 2. Low conversion rates to buy (less than 2% of all visitors convert into buyers; this is significantly lower compared to books or electronics sold online) because end users are uncertain which size to buy. Today, only 9% of all garments are sold online and 91% are still sold in brick-and-mortar stores, whereas more than 50% of all books and electronics are sold over the internet.  We have already deployed the world’s most widely-used Size Advisor (“FITA1.0”) in the market, an innovative ICT product to help end-users find the right size online by providing simple size recommendations. Within the framework of the SME Instrument, Phase II, we are aiming to implement a new, ground-breaking size and product recommendation solution (“FITA2.0”) which will further disrupt the fashion retail market by using exclusive cross-shop purchase and return data for highly accurate size and personalized product recommendations.  We have already developed a minimal viable product (MVP) of FITA2.0 that was successfully tested in an operational environment (TRL6) on Gaastra, a leading Dutch-German brand.We have undertaken a commercial and technical feasibility study, with positive results, and this will form the basis for a business implementation plan to be created during the project. In order to accelerate the market acceptance of the solution after implementation, we have already signed contracts with several clients that have agreed to implement FITA2.0 in the future.  The project is closely related to the objectives of the call due to its disruptive character and planned market uptake.",0,1
581,87414,No,The Role of Lymphatic Vessels in Dendritic Cell Homing and Maturation,"Dendritic cell (DC) activation and homing from the periphery to lymph nodes is a critical first event in the immune response. It involves upregulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and chemoinvasion towards lymphatic vessels. Despite its critical importance in adaptive immunity, the mechanisms of DC migration towards and entry into lymphatics are still poorly understood; this severely limits new therapeutic strategies for immunomodulation and even strategies for treating lymphedema, which is exacerbated by poor immune functioning. We propose a battery of physiological, cell-biological, molecular, and computational studies to determine both the mechanisms of DC homing to lymphatic vessels and how DCs modulate lymphatic function. We approach this from the perspectives of both the DC and the lymphatic vessel. Regarding the DC, we will examine computationally and experimentally how draining flows toward the lymphatic alter their migration tactics and test our hypothesis that DCs possess a biomolecular flow-detector network (which we refer to as autologous chemotaxis) and are thus able to sense the direction of the subtle flow of fluid toward the lymphatics. Regarding the lymphatic vessel, we will elucidate how biochemical and biophysical inflammatory signals regulate their drainage function, alter cell-cell adhesions and overall permeability, and alter adhesion receptors to facilitate DC homing and entry. Finally, we will examine DC migration in mice with dysfunctional lymphatics and explore strategies to improve immune response. These will be carried out in 4 main projects, and will complement our recent work in lymphatic functional biology as well as our more therapeutic investigations in DC targeting and activation (Reddy et al., Nature Biotechnol., 2007). This deeper knowledge of mechanisms of DC-lymphatic cross-talk in a relevant biophysical context will enable our long-term goal of rational design for therapeutic immunomodulation and lymphedema.",0,0
126,51019,Yes,CO-UTILISATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE BY CO-GASIFICATION IN A FLUIDISED BED GASIFICATION SYSTEM,"- Demonstration of the suitability of the High-Temperature-Winkler gasification process (HTW) for efficient utilisation of brown coal and municipal solid waste (MSW) by co-gasification in a fluidised bed system at commercial scale. - Support of market penetration by confirming the engineering data base in a commercial-scale plant, in particular with respect to gasification behaviour, appropriate gasifier layout, fuel gas quality, solids handling and emissions. - Reliable separation of all relevant pollutants and harmful species in a simple and tested gas-cleaning system. - Saving of fossil energy by substitution of brown coal with municipal solid waste (1 ton pre-treated MSW substitutres about 0.6 to brown coal). Estimated payback/about 3 years. Phase 1 : preparing /planning As a result of the detailed planning during phase 1, it was decided to procure the amount of about 1000 t of pre-traeted (dried and pelletised) municipal solid waste from several suppliers. The project partners regarded this as the best way to meet two major points : firstly, a high availability of pre-treated waste during the test series at the dates specified in the time schedule of the programme and secondly to have the opportunity to gain more technical experience with waste from different sources and origin to enlarge the database for later evaluation. Even the last issue is very important due to the fact that different waste-collecting systems in different regions influence the composition of the waste material. During an initial test about 42 tons of pre-treated waste were conveyed successfully through the feeding system of the gasifier.  Phase 2 : demonstration The demonstration phase was divided into three test series; During the first test 329 tons of pre-treated waste were co-gasified with the regularly used brown coal. Here, the co-feeding rate of waste was about 5 t/h. During the second test, 316 tons of pre-treated waste were gasified. After starting this test with a co-feeding rate of 25% as mentioned, the rate was increased up of waste was increased to 10 t/h while decreasing the mass-flow of brown coal to below 10 t/h. so, finally, experience was gained with an overall feeding rate of waste of more than 50%. During the test series 1051 tons of pre-treated waste were gasified most successfully to the entire satisfaction of the projects partners. On-line analyses were inconspicious and the gas composition did not show significant changes in comparison to mono-gasification with brown coal. Only the content of H2S increased from 600 ppm to 1000 ppm as expected. The test series performed with the use of a pilot hot gas filter for part stream desulphurisation revealed that desulphurisation rates of up to 95% are feasible and it was thus substantiated that this simple method is well suited for thermal treatment of MSW. Phase 3: verification The evaluation of the trace constituent analyses programme confirmed that the ash is fully suitable for dumping except for its carbon content and that the hot gas filter method permits a removal of all ecologically off-specification substances from the raw gas stream, except for the nitrogenous compounds. An expert opinion document issued by the FZ Karlsruhe confirms that the German emmission regulations (17th BImSchV) are fully met. The experience gained in the project enables us to make the following statement: - the suitability of the High-Temperature-Winkler gasification process (HTW process) for efficient and non-polluting utilisation of brown coal and municipal solid waste by co-gasification in a fluidised bed system at commercial scale has been demonstrated. - the demonstration project yielded useful operating experience and process engineering data and provides engineering reliability for the design of future plants and a reference for marketing. 1.INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY : - co-utilisation by co-gasification of brown coal and pre-treated municipal waste (MSW) according to the HTW process. - production of fuel gas or synthesis gas suitable for high efficient utilisation in gas engines and gas turbines or as a feedstock for chemical synthesis. -transition from atmospheric gasification or incineration of MSW to gasification under elevated pressure by co-gasification with brown coal in a fluidized bed system. - demonstration of a reliable separation of all relevant pollutants and harmful species in a simple and tested gas-cleaning system. 2. CONTEXT : 20 years ago, Rheinbraun AG as the plant operator and Krupp Udhe as the engineering partner started the development of the HTW fluidised bed gasification process at elevated pressure. So far, several different feedstocks have been successfully tested to produce syngas for different purposes. The high flexibility of the HTW process has been demonstrated even for low-grade feedstocks with a high content of ash. At Berrenrath, Germany, Rheinbraun operates a HTW plant gasifying brown coal to produce syngas for a downstream methanol plant. The aim of the project is to substitute up to about 5t/h of the brown coal (normally 27 t/h, mf) with pre-treated MSW. 3. ECONOMIC ASPECTS : - cost effective energy production due to the substitution of brown coal with MSW - cost-effective waste disposal and protection of the environment - the pay-back for the additional equipment required is about 3,2 years. 4. Monitoring : All necessary process data will be monitored to confirm engineering data in respect of energy and mass balances, gas, ash and dust composition and emissions.",1,1
693,96689,No,Single-Molecule BioAssays at Elevated Concentrations,"In order to advance single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to the next level, handling and analysis of single molecules has to become broadly available. A further quantum leap is required to proceed to commercially successful applications such as drug screening and medical diagnostics. In this project, I suggest a strategy to overcome the fundamental gap between the nanomolar concentration regime of current optical single-molecule spectroscopy and the nano- to millimolar dissociation constants of typical biomolecular interactions. I will use nano-apertures, which confine the detection to sub-attoliter volumes and allow single-molecule studies at elevated concentrations. To overcome unspecific binding and deteriorated fluorescence signals in the nano-apertures, I will use tailor-made DNA nanostructures produced by DNA origami. These nanostructures will match the nano-apertures like a plug in a socket. Inserting molecules at programmed positions in the nanostructures will open up a new realm of applications by the ability to immobilize exactly one molecule per nano-aperture and by obtaining comparable signals from every nano-aperture. I will spectroscopically characterize the nano-apertures creating a fluorescence map of their inside. I will exemplarily use the new abilities for previously impossible applications such as several folds improvement of single-molecule DNA sequencing, direct single-molecule RNA sequencing by reverse transcriptase for cancer screening, for paralleled drug screening of HIV protease inhibitors and for studying the chemomechanical coupling of single helicases. In summary, I envision a broadly applicable platform that has the potential to become a golden standard by enabling both ground breaking fundamental research and commercial applications.",0,0

456,102340,No,Basic Wind Tunnel Investigation to Explore the Use of Active Flow Control Technology for Aerodynamic Load Control,"'STARLET project objective is to design a new concept of active flow control system based on suction-blowing devices for the control of the aerodynamic load on aircraft wing and to check its usability by CFD calculations and wind tunnel tests. The aim of the flow control concept to be investigated is the alleviation of wing structural loading, especially of the bending moment, having direct influence on the structure fatigue life,  through the modification of wing aerodynamic load distribution in gusts and off-design flight conditions.  To achieve this goal the implementation of suction-blowing technique for active control of aerodynamic load distribution on aircraft wing is proposed. Several concepts of active flow control system will be proposed and evaluated using CFD calculations and the most promising solutions of suction-blowing systems will be investigated through wind tunnel tests. These experimental tests will include fully-3D investigations on a large scale wing model (semi-span wing). It is expected, that as a results of these investigations, innovative, dedicated solutions of suction-blowing 'smart structures' will be designed and adapted in wing-load-control systems. The proposed work will begin with a review of the existing state of knowledge on the topics of the project, leading to the formulation of requirements for the concept of active load control. It is assumed that ILOT concept will be directed towards blowing devices located in selected regions of the wing including spoiler area and vicinity of the trailing edge. For the wind-tunnel investigation an 2.4 m, existing semi-span wing model equipped with movable aileron and flap is proposed to be used.

639,205838,No,Alternative Splicing Codes for Synaptic Specificity,"Neuronal networks represent an impressive example of highly organized complex systems. Sperry postulated that selective neuronal connectivity is achieved by chemoaffinity labels. Several such labels for axon guidance and topographic mapping have been defined. However, until recently, molecules that direct the recognition of synaptic partners and functional specification of synapses have remained obscure.  Chemoaffinity tags are envisioned to provide a recognition code that would encompass the recognition of self versus non-self, recognition of sister cells, and recognition of appropriate and inappropriate synaptic partners.  Key parameters that determine the function of recognition systems are the diversity (number of independently recognizable tags), the repertoires of recognition tags in a cell population, and the contribution of tags to selective interactions. The finite number of protein-coding genes in the human genome severely limits the genetic resources that can be employed for generating molecular diversity. In this project we will test the hypothesis that alternative splicing is a central mechanism for the amplification of molecular diversity in recognition tags and their role in synaptic specificity. We will implement novel mass-spectrometry and sequencing methods to define molecular diversity of a highly diversified receptor family in mice. We will unravel the logic of receptor repertoires across cell populations and test the importance of cell type-specific alternative splicing programs for synaptic specificity.   The focus of this project on cell-type specific alternative splicing advances a new dimension in neuronal transcriptomics. Discoveries and technical innovations made in this work should be applicable to molecular studies of recognition events in any system.

It is specifically tailored for  1) Optimisation of novel or improved cell, interconnect and sealing materials, 2) Achievement of innovative designs for SOE stacks to improve durability. As such, it is positioned as a bridge between currently good performing electrolysis cells and their efficient and reliable integration into advanced stacks to pave the way for the production of a new generation of electrolysers.   To achieve these goals, the RelHy project is based on the coupled development of instrumented single repeat units and stacks and of associated simulation tools (from cell to stack scale). This mixed experimental and simulation approach will be used on several batches of materials - to give specifications for novel or improved materials and evaluate them, where special attention is paid to material compatibility (between electrodes, electrolyte, coating, interconnects and sealing). - to propose innovative designs able to overcome the present limiting parameters and to increase stack reliability, durability and performance.  These material and design innovations will be validated at laboratory scale on a 25-cell stack prototype and its competitiveness will be assessed.  Since the project is centered on R&D activities, the RelHy multidisciplinary European consortium is merging expertise from two university laboratories and three research centres already recognised for material development and cell production, instrumentation and testing, and modelling (DTU-Risoe, Imperial College, ECN, EIFER and CEA) and also from a fuel cell stack manufacturer that can produce electrolyser stacks (TOFC) and from an energy company (HELION) that can specify the operation conditions and assess the competitiveness of the innovative electrolyser prototype and its potential integration.

Partners of this proposal have already demonstrated a record efficiency of 14.1% for cells on polyimide and &gt;15% efficiency cells on metal foil using “static deposition” processes. However, transfer of “static deposition” process to “in-line deposition” on moving substrates brings additional challenges for control of layer composition and interfaces. Choice of appropriate substrate and deposition processes to overcome problems of thermal mismatch-related stress are important for high performance and monolithic cell interconnection. The main goal of the project is to develop innovative flexible substrates and deposition processes suitable for the in-line and/or roll-to-roll production of highly efficient solar modules using thinner (&lt; 1 micron) CIGS absorbers and with potential for production costs below 0.6 €/Wp in future.

294,188086,No,Age-modified forms of Amyloid-β as initiator of Alzheimer Disease pathogenesis and mediator of Aβ-tau interaction: a study in a Drosophila model and Aβ immunized human Alzheimer patients,"Alzheimer Disease (AD) is the commonest form of dementia, with ageing as the main risk factor. There are currently over 6 million people with dementia in the European Union (EU). The increasingly ageing population makes AD an economic and social burden for our society, thus investigating the pathological mechanisms of AD and the characterization of the pharmacological targets are research priorities. Aggregation of amyloid-Beta (Aβ), upstream of tau phosphorylation, is considered a driving force in AD pathogenesis, and the major target of the clinical trials of immunotherapy. The first clinical trial at Southampton University (UoS) showed Aβ removal but also reduced phospho-tau, supporting a link between these proteins. Similar evidence emerged in bigenic tau/Aβ Drosophila, a neurodegeneration model. During ageing in humans, the molecules of AD pathogenesis undergo ageing processes resulting in amino acid modifications that influence protein folding, functionality and interactions. Specially, pyroglutamate-modiﬁed Aβ (pEAβ) seems to be a key participant in AD pathology. Accordingly, the identification of markers of protein ageing is important to comprehend AD pathogenesis with relevance in therapies. Indeed, Aβ immunotherapy did not improve the cognition in the treated patients, potentially due to the absence of clearance of aged-modified Aβ implicated in pathological pathways. I propose to exploit the bigenic tau/Aβ drosophila to determine if pEAβ increases with ageing, driving AD pathogenesis; and whether pEAβ is the major Aβ form mediating Aβ/tau interaction. Taking advantage of the unique cohort of human unimmunized and immunized AD brains at UoS, I will investigate if pEAβ formation and its interaction with tau have been modified by Aβ immunotherapy. The results will expand the Aβ characterization as a pharmacological target, and support the rational design of a second generation of “Aβ immunotherapies”.

A growing number of infectious agents – such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and salmonellosis – with every day are becoming harder to identify and treat correctly without laboratory tests, is the main cause for a massive scale of misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Approximately 30% to 50% of antibiotic use in humans is inappropriate or even unnecessary. Due to lack of diagnosis available (Time-consuming, cost, absence of infrastructure) physicians commonly prescribe antibiotics based on symptoms. However, this approach does not allow to distinguish if the disease is caused by bacteria or viruses on which drug will work and which won't.

However, many catalytic reactions use hazardous reagents, are unpractical on laboratory-scale or limited in scope. Moreover, while a relatively broad set of catalytic reactions are available to construct chemical bonds, methods to cleave those, which could find applications in biomass and waste valorization, are rare.   Inspired by the synthetic power of other metal-catalyzed reversible reactions, such as transfer hydrogenation and alkene metathesis, I herein describe a groundbreaking approach to homogeneous catalysis that makes use of a novel paradigm called “shuttle catalysis”, defined as the catalytic reversible transfer of chemical moieties between two molecules, to construct and deconstruct organic compounds.

The second part addresses the challenge of developing safer catalytic carbonylation and decarbonylation reactions that do not use nor release toxic carbon monoxide gas. Finally, the last part proposes to apply the shuttle catalysis concept to the invention of unprecedented C–X (X = P, O, S, N) bond metathesis reactions. This new approach to catalysis has the potential to revolutionize the preparation, and streamline the discovery, of numerous important molecules with applications across the molecular sciences. Importantly, in order to mitigate the high risks inherent to such a groundbreaking approach, we have collected preliminary results to demonstrate the feasibility of each of the proposed subprojects.",0,0
167,5326,Yes,Ash recycling technologies,"To investigate some new alternatives in the field of reclycling of fly ashes from urban solid waste, to assess their environmental impact, to identify the possible final building products, to compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches.  A project has been set up to study the reuse of waste incineration fly ashes as construction materials with safe and stable behaviour and avoiding environmental concern. Likewise, the reuse of lead containing glass from fluorescent lamps for foam glass production. The objective was to supply decision making elements as to the most suitable recycling process, taking into consideration technical, economic and social aspects.   One technical aspect developed was a process to transform incinerator ashes directly into components for civil construction (eg paving stones). Ash generated fibres were produced which have a greater alkali resistance than standard E-type glass fibres. A good traction resistance was also displayed. Foam glass was obtained by recycling of fluorescent lampas and cathode ray tubes. A process for detoxification was developed. The glass showed a lighter load and lower bulk density relative to granule size than normal recycled glass.  A thermal process has been developed for the sinterization of pellets consisting of municipal solid waste (MSW) ashes and other wastes such as steel work dusts and coal fly ashes. Samples have been obtained for characterization tests. A method which recycles MSW to produce a material similar in quality and properties to lightweight concrete is under development. Chemical, physical and environmental tests have been carried out on various materials produced from MSW fly ashes. Work has been undertaken on the possibilities for stabilizing and utilizing industrial rest materials ashes, dusts, slurries etc, to produce binder materials.  An investigation has been carried out of the MSW incineration methods adopted in different European countries. Legal constraints on MSW fly ash recycling have been studied. Three technological routes will be examined :  i) Combination of fly ashes with hydraulic binders, based on silica to obtain special aggregates for concrete.  ii) Production of 'gres' material in form of sinterized pellets, to obtain aggregates for concrete and bitumen.  iii) Spinning of fly ash mixtures in form of thin fibers, to be used in lime, concrete and bitumen composites.  A fourth specific task will be devoted to the recycling of exhausted fluorescent, energy saving, high pressure, and cathode ray tubes, that cannot be mixed up with standard recycled glass due to their high heavy metal content. Recycling processes for these materials can be put in connection with fly ash recycling, considering the chemical composition and environmental concerns. The possible production of foam glass will be specifically investigated.",1,1
136,14036,Yes,DECONTAMINATION OF SOLID ALPHA WASTES AND RECOVERY OF THE PLUTONIUM (PROLIXE FACILITY),"NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES IN THE RADIOCHEMISTRY BUILDING OF FONTENAY AUX ROSES NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTER CONCERN PRINCIPALLY THE STUDY OF FUEL REPROCESSING AND THE PRODUCTION OF TRANSURANIUM ISOTOPES. DURING THESE ACTIVITIES SOLID WASTES ARE PRODUCED THAT ARE CONTAMINATED WITH 'ALPHA BETA GAMMA' EMITTERS FOR HOT CELLS STUDIES AND WITH A EMITTERS ONLY FOR GLOVE-BOX EXPERIMENTS.  IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE WASTES IT HAS BEEN DECIDED TO BUILD NEW FACILITIES :  A/A GROUP OF THREE GLOVE BOXES NAMED ELISE FOR THE TREATMENT OF 'ALPHA' ACTIVE SOLID WASTES  B/A HOT-CELL (PROLIXE FACILITY) FOR THE TREATMENT OF 'ALPHA BETA GAMMA' ACTIVE SOLID WASTES.   IN THESE FACILITIES WE WILL DEVELOP LEACHING PROCESSES IN ORDER TO :  1/ DECONTAMINATE THESE WASTES EXPECIALLY IN A EMITTERS TO OBTAIN A LEVEL OF ALPHA CONTAMINATION <0,1CI XT -1 OF THE CONDITIONNED WASTES WHICH WILL BE SUITABLE FOR SURFACE SITE DISPOSAL  2/ RECOVER ACTINIDE ELEMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE HIGHLY VALUABLE PLUTONIUM.  THESE TWO ITEMS CONSTITUTE THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT PROGRAMME.  In order to improve the management of solid wastes, contaminated with alpha, beta and gamma emitters or with alpha emitters only, it had been decided to build the following new facilities: a group of 3 glove boxes, named ELISE, for the treatment of alpha active solid waste; a hot cell, PROLIXE, for the treatment of alpha, beta and gamma emitting solid wastes.  In these facilities leaching processes were developed in order to: decontaminate these wastes, especially the alpha emitters, in order to obtain a level of residual alpha contamination of less than 0.1 Curies per tonne of the conditioned wastes, which will be suitable for surface site disposal; recover actinide elements, particularly the highly valuable plutonium, from the leachates.  The processes developed are sufficiently flexible to be able to accommodate solid wastes produced in other facilities. Various types of waste have been studied and laboratory studies have been conducted to develop the leaching process, based on the use of electrogenerated silver(II) species, which is particularly suitable for the dissolution of plutionium oxide.  An important result obtained during the experiments performed in ELISE was related to the recyclability of the leachates after concentration, allowing the minimisation of the generation of secondary wastes. To be able to realise these experiments specific apparatus was designed, built and operated in hot conditions, particularly the silver (II) electrolyser and the cyclone evaporator for leachate concentration. Based on the results obtained on laboratory and pilot scales, it was possible to design conceptual flow sheets for industrial facilities.  In conclusion, it appears that the exhaustive decontamination of alpha and alpha, beta and gamma emitting solid wastes is certainly feasible at an industrial level using leaching processes. This is particularly true for massive metallic wastes. In the case of the other wastes the feasibility of such a goal is still questionable, nevertheless, large plutonium recovery yields are obtainable in the case of the treatment of incineration ashes. For organic solid wastes leaching with electrogenerated reducing agents can be an alternative to the oxidising process. B.1.

The project will develop demonstration cells within five different companies showing a radically new method to monitor product quality by automatically quantifying attributes and variables within a Statistical Process Control environment. The generic system is based on sub space sensory data classification methods and parameterised clipped data, which can be intelligently, interpret the product and process. It will allow for the first time the computer integration of quality control and process machine monitoring within a Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering (CIME) environment. These cells will show the benefits applied to difficult batch production processes of; machining toughened steel, plastic injection moulding with manual interaction, wave soldering and special purpose polypropylene blow moulding machine to produce medical filters. The live production data also enables a live production scheduler which can give better forecasting based upon Manufacturing Requirements Planning (MRP) by including predicted product and machine problems. The Human Computer Interface (HCI) will be an interactive virtual reality three dimensional model of the manufacturing process, which provides a simple pick select, and inquire method. Thus the HCI may be moved forward in time to give a more reliable forward scheduler. Expected benefits by companies using this system would typically gain a 33 50% improvement in identified manufacturing faults with material scrap savings of more than half current values. Immediate additional savings of more than 5% of total costs are expected in improved production and maintenance management.

This collaborative training network will combine the complementary training capabilities of each individual partner institution to improve the trainees’ chances for employment and promote health and welfare in the EC by providing the capability to develop novel functional foods. The scientific focus of the research training is on colloidal delivery systems to protect and deliver active components via foods, resulting in novel functional foods. The development of these systems is to be based on only food-grade ingredients and upon economical feasible processes. The hypothesis is that the materials and coatings can be made responsive to the external chemical conditions and therefore suitable for controlled releases targeted at a desired stage during food processing or at a specific point during digestion of the food, e.g. in the intestinal tract. This will involve probiotic bacteria and enzymes that are liberated and allowed to be active in a controllable way. The ultimate successful materials ensure stability of the active component during long term storage prior to food production, during food production or during digestion, but at the same time liberating the active component at the right point. The behaviour and interaction of the delivery systems will be studied by simulation of gastric and intestinal conditions and by implementation in food production and formulation into probiotic products. To summarize, through the training in BIBAFOODS, 14 young researchers will achieve superior qualifications that will make them highly competitive and attractive for the European food and bio-tech industry.'",1,0

The secondary objective will be to develop tools at cellular and molecular levels to render morphogenetic events accessible to scientific analysis.   Many plant species,including economically important crops,can not be regenerated from single cells in-vitro. We propose to investigate the mechanism controlling the induction of cell proliferation in-vitro. We Will use Brassica napus microspores as a model system since-freshly isolated-microspores can be redirected to an embryo formation pathway at frequencies of up to 70 percent. 32 C heat treatment of an 8 hour duration is sufficient to initiate and sustain the microspore embryogenic process. The B.napus microspore culture system has a number of other characteristics-well suited for such studies. The specific areas to be investigated:genes regulating induction of microspore embryogenesis,regulation of cytoskeletal and other cellular components during the induction phase and inheritance of the induction specific character(s) in a plant population. We will also compare B.napus microspores With Hordeum vulgare(barley) microspores to identify common molecular features-of microspore embryogenesis induction in dicots and monocot. The project proposes to significantly improve our understanding of the inductive phase of microspore embryogenesis in particular and cell proliferation in general.

The technology is safe and simple but has one glaring flaw: it cannot detect non-metal threats, including plastic explosives (The infamous underwear bomber almost exploited that flaw to devastating effect). There are processes and mechanisms that must be followed to ensure the safety and security of people, for example, in case of an abandoned luggage, authorities are forced to bring-in the bomb squad (In average, around 1,600 interventions every year by the bomb squad - 6 times a day at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris ), and the area is usually cordoned off by soldiers or border police due to suspicious or unattended luggage.   Walleye is the world’s first fully portable scanner, battery powered with hand-held microwave imaging technology. Its revolutionary handheld camera can see through luggage, walls, clothing (including coats), packaging, suitcases, shoes, and opaque containers to provide video images of what is inside. Its small, lightweight and inexpensive design makes it a superior solution for imaging the interior of abandoned boxes, and the like for controlled substances, hazardous materials, explosive devices, and other security threats that current scanners can't detect. Walleye’s technology, currently at TRL6 stage, is patented (Patents number: 8593157 – 8451162).

660,94156,No,"Innovative Design and Top Quality in Gold Jewellery Casting through Integration of Applied Computer Simulation, Design-of-Experiments and Rapid Prototyping","The European jewellery industry is facing a severe competition from Far Eastern countries on both home and export markets. The import of large volumes of low cost jewellery puts the margins under pressure. European companies, often employing less than 10 persons, traditionally show poor attraction for co-operation and research. This attitude hinders changes and innovation, though current production methods have rejection rates up to 20 or even 30% and up to 25% of job places could be lost in the sector over the next five years. Aim of this project is to introduce a new approach into jewellery design and production, through the development of a simulation tool on broad basis, the exploitation of the full potential of existing Rapid-Prototyping Technology and the use of Design of Experiment. Detailed research and analysis will be carried out both on materials properties and on processes, the latter being examined both at a laboratory and industrial scales. The SME proposer group represents the entire chain of suppliers, manufacturers and developers of jewellery materials, equipments and technology. RTD performers consist of complementary research partners with large and worldwide recognised experience.

437,217447,No,A fast non-intrusive vapour detection system that rapidly identifies explosives in public areas,"Terrorism has become the most prominent security issue of the 21st century and fighting terrorism is a top priority. Our society has been the target of a series of deadly terror attacks in recent years. A total of 11,072 terrorist attacks occurred worldwide in 2016, resulting in more than 25,600 total deaths and more than 33,800 people injured. Explosives were used in 54% of the attacks.  Explosives or bombs can be made easily at home and hidden simply in a suit or under clothes, making it impossible to notice without specialised equipment. Existing solutions such as X-ray machines, security scanners and body search, are not capable of detecting explosives as such: they merely detect objects which might be explosives. In addition, they often require the direct involvement of security staff, resulting in time-consuming procedures. Therefore, even simple bag or body screening can significantly increase the waiting time and crowd. The Eye on Air solution is a fast non-intrusive screening system for detecting explosive materials in public areas. The key innovation lies in an ultra-compact Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) sensor, capable of detecting any kind of explosives as required by the European Civilian Aviation Conference (ECAC) within 2-5 seconds. The first application of the IMS technology will be AirBrush, a shoe-specific explosive vapour detection system for airports.

292,227338,No,ASsembly and phase Transitions of Ribonucleoprotein Aggregates in neurons: from physiology to pathology.,"Recent works indicate the pathogenic relevance of altered RNA metabolism and aberrant ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. How defective RNPs form, what are their integral components and which events trigger their appearance late in life are still unsolved issues.  While emerging evidence indicates that mutations and post-translational modifications of specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) induce liquid-solid phase transition in vitro, much less is known about the in vivo properties of RNP assemblies and which role RNA plays in their formation.  ASTRA will combine sophisticated imaging-derived RNP complex purification with innovative computational approaches and powerful genetic tools to unravel the biophysical properties and composition of RBP complexes and how they are modified in disease conditions. Through the development of new imaging and optical methods we plan to study how RNPs separate in liquid and solid phases in cells, in tissues (retina) and animal models and to characterize their RNA and protein components in physiological and pathological states. Exploiting the novel finding that non-coding RNAs act as scaffolding molecules for RNP assembly, we will investigate how such RNAs control the dynamic link between RNP formation, intracellular sorting and function. In a genuine interdisciplinary team effort, we will reveal how the architecture and localization of cytoplasmic RNP complexes are controlled in motor neurons and affected in neurodegeneration. We plan to develop novel advanced microscopy methods to monitor formation of aberrant RNPs in vivo and we will explore new molecules to impede pathological cascades driven by RNP assemblies. In conclusion, ASTRA will allow us to gain a comprehensive understanding of RNP function and dysfunction; we will use this knowledge to develop new therapeutic strategies that will impact on several protein-misfolding neurodegenerative diseases.",0,0
673,93997,No,The Late Eocene climatic transition from greenhouse to icehouse conditions in the Neo-Tethys,"The middle Eocene to early Oligocene period represents the most important transition in Earth’s climate: from greenhouse conditions to the icehouse conditions of the present day. This global transition was preceded by long-term cooling with superposed short-term variations in various marine proxies, which indicate instability in the paleoceanographic state prior to the key climatic transition. We propose to test the hypothesis that global variations in climatic conditions were synchronous with large variations in circulation in the Neo-Tethys Ocean. Tectonic closure of the gateway between the Arabian and Eurasian plates represents a threshold that caused late Eocene paleoceanographic variations in the Neo-Tethys and in global ocean circulation. The premise of this proposal is that new paleomagnetic and environmental studies of Eocene sequences from the Tethys sector and Indian Ocean drill cores can provide important insights about the timing and nature of paleoclimatic events and sedimentary processes that affected the Eocene oceans. We will develop new high-resolution magnetostratigraphies from each proposed section to determine the timing of the bio-magnetic and climatic events. Sites in the Indian Ocean and sections in Italy, Egypt and Turkey are the best candidates. We propose a multidisciplinary study that involves detailed bio-magnetostratigraphy, environmental magnetism and cyclostratigraphic astronomical calibration. Paleobiological abundances, isotopic analyses and geochemistry will then be used to develop an integrated view of paleoceanographic events in this key interval of geological time. The quantitative dataset to be obtained will enable us to test the hypothesis that paleoceanographic variations in the Neo-Tethys were related to global Eocene climatic changes and variations in ocean circulation.",0,0

Network functionalities will be enhanced to include the detection and tracking of moving objects/persons without tags eventually present in the same area.To achieve this goal, several technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), ultra wideband backscattering modulation, time reversal, relaying and energy scavenging, and associated advanced algorithms, will be considered and partly or totally integrated in a demonstrator. This will require the design of multi-frequency/multi-technology tags for system-neutral identification along the use lifetime of a tag, based on advanced concepts in low-consumption chip and antenna design.Innovative techniques will be considered to improve the location accuracy, increase tag energy efficiency and extend system coverage by a mixture of progress in the system architecture, in the detection and tag activation techniques, and in the complexity-performance trade off of chip design.Special emphasis will be given to the analysis and design of 'green' solutions by considering low complexity and low power tags through the exploitation of passive communication (without integrated tag batteries) as well smart cooperation strategies.Finally, single system components and the overall system performance will be validated through experimental characterization, hardware implementation, as well as simulation.Identification/detection reliability, tracking accuracy, power consumption will be amongst the major evaluation criteria.A wireless network integrating detection, identification, and location would lead to relevant improvements in the development of a wide range of advanced applications including logistics (package tracking) and supply chain management (SCM).",0,0
751,83780,No,Differences in language structures as a guide to studying cross-cultural differences in cognition: gender and articles,"The issue of relation between language and cognition is again, after decades of a relative abandonment, in the centre of scientific interest. Results of recent studies suggest that people from different cultures may differ more in their cognition than previously thought, and that language does indeed provide us with good clues as to where to look for those differences. In most research language is even indicated as a causal force, which, by influencing our cognition from early childhood, brings about differences in our habits of categorisation, processes of remembering, and conceptualisation of basic cognitive domains such as time, or spatial relations.  The main aim of this project is to contribute to this line of research: to investigate new possible areas of differences, to develop new research methods, and, on a more theoretical level to deepen the understanding of mechanisms involved in the emergence of such differences. A series of experiments has been designed, in which cognitive correlates of two differences between Polish and Italian will be studied: gender and articles. The choice of research topic was dictated by: clear structural differences between Polish and Italian, the social importance of the gender category, and the fact that articles are absent in Polish and other Slavic languages and are very difficult to learn by speakers of those languages. I would like to conduct those studies at the University of Bologna and Scuola Superiore di Studi Umanistici, Italy, where I hope to benefit from extensive theoretical, methodological and empirical background of Prof. Nicoletta Caramelli in research on conceptual structure.  At the theoretical level, I would like to continue my work on a framework in which language changes and cross-cultural variations may be encompassed. This would be greatly aided by participating in the activities of SSSUB as well as the consultations with its director, Prof. Umberto Eco.",0,0
74,110874,Yes,Traditional Food Network to improve the transfer of knowledge for innovation,"In the European Union, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the food sector are increasingly under pressure due to developing open markets, increasing demand of standardized and price competitive food products by the consumers, rising importance of large retailers and challenges in obeying governmental regulations. This raises the risk of losing many traditional foods as well as traditional processing techniques which are applied by SMEs using regional raw materials and often have a role in the cultural identity of regions. In urban centers in Europe, groups of consumers are increasingly demanding traditional, local and/or organic food productions as food poisoning cases and the dispute on GMO undermined public confidence on industrial food producing systems. To reach these markets, SMEs of traditional foods must extend their skills in modern as well as competitive marketing and production techniques to comply with existing European regulations and to promote the aspects of their products related to nutrition and health. To support these traditional SMEs, a knowledge transfer network shall be established with the focus on different food product sectors: Grains, fishes, fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. These food sectors are traditional, healthy foodstuffs which are essential for a balanced nutrition. To support traditional SMEs in these food sectors, a European network will interlink researchers, knowledge transfer organizations and associations of SMEs on European, national and region levels. The network will act as a mediator of information about innovations in production and marketing of traditional food, will foster entrepreneurship in the sector of traditional food producers and researchers as well as will develop strategic research and innovation agendas for the traditional food sectors to be competitive on future markets.",1,1

INFOPOLIS is clearly intended for the end-user of Public Transport ; its aim is to improve the user access to Public Transport information by concentrating on the presentation, as well as on the contents, of information  The first phase is based on an in-depth analysis of telematics systems currently in use in the transport area as well as in any other area likely to be of interest from the user viewpoint ; for given functionalities, it deals with the ergonomic features concerning the access procedures, the interface interactivity as well as the possible feedback related to the user behaviour and acceptance. The second phase aims at laying sound foundations in the design of user interface by taking advantage of recent scientific findings in two major disciplines : ergonomics and cognitive modelling. Based upon these findings, very accurate and scientific protocols will be, in a third phase, defined and setup on existing sites for 'live' observations of end users in order to elicit more knowledge on the user cognitive activity. It is expected that this in-depth study will contribute to a new basis for the design of future information systems for the user.  The project deals with pre-trip and on-trip information (timetables, route finding, services, points of interest,..). A special emphasis is placed on the presentation of multimodal solutions accessible via on-street public terminal.  INFOPOLIS is an horizontal project which aims at following up and broadening works undertaken within the framework of the DRIVE II INPUT task force ; its ultimate goal is the provision of guidelines and recommendations for European standardisation of user interfaces to PT information. For this purpose, the consortium is prepared to play a leading role in a related task force likely to be created within the framework of this programme.  An important concern of INFOPOLIS is to ensure a close cooperation with PT operators : six large cities operators are involved in the project.  The initial INFOPOLIS was a 3-year proposal ; as negotiated with the EC, the present project has a one-year duration ; it will partly carry out tasks which were planned for the first year of the 3-year project. By the end of this year, some key material will be available : a state-of-the-art overview of existing telematic systems for PT information ; a synthesis on ergonomic and cognitive approaches ; a detailed report of 'live' observations and findings likely to fruitfully influence the design of future systems. At last, in order to gather and illustrate all these findings, a novel mockup of the user interface of an interactive terminal will be designed. These outcomes should pave the way for further guidelines and standard recommendations.",0,0

The programme is aimed at 3rd cycle doctoral level training. Added bonus to the action is that seven EST fellows will gain a PhD during the training period, and approximately 10 visiting fellows will gain training for 3-6 months in our research group over the span of four years.  The research focus will be on understanding reaction mechanisms and structures of organic and biogenic molecules on mineral surfaces. We will use the wide range of analytical techniques available in Bristol: surface tit ration and potentiometry; film deposition; AFM; XPS; Raman spectroscopy; XRD; SEM/EDX; TEM; and SIMS in addition to new developments in ultra high speed AFM and non-contact AFM. Together this will give the EST researchers specific scientific and technological competencies in nanoscale surface research.  This programme, with an emphasis on transnational and intersectoral mobility, will have two outcomes: (1) a broadening of the research base in basic nanoscience in line with EU priorities; and (2) the training of a body of young scientists uniquely equipped to meet the challenges of working in nanoscience.  The research team is multidisciplinary and their training will produce scientists skilled in a number of techniques and familiar with the MISSION core disciplines. Alongside day-to-day supervision, the EST fellows will also learn a wide range of transferable and complementary skills including seminar and poster presentations, writing concise scientific English, web page design, video conferencing, conference organization, undergraduate (1st and 2nd cycle) teaching, entrepreneurship and management training.",0,0

Under the Kyoto protocol Europe seeks ways to reduce greenhouse (CO2)emissions. Fact that the Eastern part of Europe is well endowed with low carbon energy resources (natural gas, biomass) is an opportunity to do so. In turn, this situation has a major relevance to the developments in industrial transformation in non-EU European countries. What policies would be required to facilitate and foster sustainable development in the whole Europe given these conditions? This is the addressed topic in this project that wants to bring together researchers (It, UK , NL, PL, CZ , RU), public policy makers and stakeholders from industry (energy, forestry) across Europe.

46,93959,Yes,Competitive Advantage for Process-intensive industries by SCheduling with Heuristics-EnhanceD simulation & optimisation,"A competitive weapon for companies in process-intensive industries such as the chemical industry, is effective mastery of supply chain management from raw material to end product so as to improve efficiency, effectiveness, &amp; profitability. However, in flow scheduling, the human operator can be overwhelmed by the complexity of the problem. CAP-SCHED involves developing a new intelligent scheduling system for companies in continuous/semi-continuous process industries. The innovative solution uses a multi-agent framework to combine 2 existing approaches which, individually, are inadequate to improve scheduling. However, combining both approaches offers significant improvements to implement more profitable solutions to scheduling problems, with better account taken of constraints. The 2 approaches are: 1. Simulation through trial &amp; error: * The scheduler instructs the system to calculate all material flows in terms of quantity &amp; quality from up- to down-stream throughout the plant; * If infeasibility occurs (e.g. capacity limitation…) then the planner readjusts parameters in trial &amp; error mode to reach a feasible solution. and 2. Algorithmic constraint solving: * the problem is represented as a mathematical model &amp; the system attempts a solution, helped by heuristic guesses so as to guide the search algorithm via domain knowledge. The new idea is to allow full interaction with the system via a Graphical User Interface as if running in simulation mode, &amp; to translate instructions, when the value of an operating parameter (or the starting date of an event…) is fixed, in terms of constraints imposed in the mathematical model. Thus, the person responsible for scheduling can choose to fix variable values, and to let the system find those left free so as to reach a feasible solution. Overall, the solution will drastically reduce the need for multiple planning/scheduling loops so as to achieve a consistently optimised solution with improved profitability.",0,1
810,72886,No,Promotion of an Integrated European the National R&D Initiative for Fossil Enegy Technologies Towards Zero Emission Power Plant,"For Europe to meet its future energy needs and to attain its environmental targets, whilst maintaining security of supply, a carbon management strategy needs to be adopted that embraces the use of fossil fuels alongside energy from other sources and a strong improvement in energy efficiency. For fossil fuels, especially gas and solids, this must entail the mitigation of CO2 through increased efficiency and the development of technologies that will lead to very low or zero emissions, including the use of CO2 capture and storage. The improvement of the performance of the key components, implementing new power plant concepts and sequestering carbon dioxide is substantial in this respect. FENCO is the preparatory step to form a single major European initiative for energy technologies towards a carbon free power production based on fossil fuels. It is foreseen to establish a European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) that defines a technology path towards low and near zero emission power plants on an extended European level and which links the R&D and demonstration needs of EU member states, the EU, industry and academia. It is envisaged that this will be based on a step-by-step approach combined with significant advances to ensure that future technologies will lead to an improved competitiveness through affordable energy prices whilst at the same time making a significant contribution towards attaining emission reduction targets. Within this SSA it is the aim of the mentioned Member States to prepare the structure and management processes of the following ERA-NET. This will be achieved by analysing the various research programs and academic initiatives in Europe, considering their position in a global sense, identifying synergies of approach and content and thus establishing the basis for a coherent and efficient fossil energy technology initiative across Europe.",1,0
845,40218,No,Circadian Photoreception: Implications for Chronobiology in Humans,"Background: Circadian systems influence every aspect of an organis's biology, fine-tuning biochemistry, physiology and behaviour to the varying demands of the daily cycle. In our own species, circadian timing has a profound impact in medicine and in agriculture, with shift work, jet-lag and the timed application of drugs being obvious examples of the interaction of biological and environmental time. While recognition of the importance of circadian timing in biology has recently increased, our comprehension of the basic mechanisms involved has lagged. Approaches to understanding circadian organization have concentrated on the mechanisms that generate the circadian rhythm, the environmental inputs regulating circadian phase (entrainment), and the outputs from the biological clock.  In this proposal we will restrict our studies to the input pathway, and investigate the organization and mechanisms of the photic system mediating circadian entrainment in mammals. Several studies have shown that the neural and molecular substrates regulating circadian responses to light are distinct from the visual channels involved in image formation and visual perception, and in this respect many assumptions about the nature of the entrainment pathway have proved to be incorrect. For example, rod photoreceptors were assumed to mediate photic entrainment, however retinally degenerate (rd) mice and transgenic mice which lack rod photoreceptors show unattenuated circadian responses to light. While it is well known that light regulates melatonin secretion by the pineal in humans, recent evidence has shown that secretion of this hormone can also be modulated by photic stimulation in certain subpopulations of blind humans.  We aim to build upon these observations and define the genetic, developmental and functional properties of the entrainment pathway of mammals. Aims and Methods. In order to dissect out the circadian light pathway, our primary strategy will rely on mammals with selective genetic 'lesions' within the retina.  To achieve this goal, we will employ natural populations of blind mammals and different strains of mice with hereditary retinal disorders. In addition, we will construct transgenic mice, which lack specific photoreceptors cells or opsins (null mutations). Another key aim of the study will focus on the organization and responses of the light entrainment pathway in primate species. Identifying the circadian photoreceptors and characterizing their connections with the central pacemaker in these models will involve the use of a broad range of experimental approaches which can only be achieved through a large scale coordinated effort involving the complementary expertise of several specialized laboratories. Our research strategies will involve recombinant DNA techniques to isolate, sequence and characterize putative 'circadian' opsins. The elements of the entrainment pathway, from the photorecptors to the circadian oscillator (suprachiasmatic nuclei, SCN) will be identified by employing in situ hybridization techniques, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural analysis, gene expression, and viral and neuroanatomical tract tracing techniques. The functional characteristics of candidate photoreceptors and of entrainment pathway will be assessed using electrophysiological and microspectrophotometric techniques, and by measuring light entrainment of circadian activity, temperature, and sleep-wake cycles. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the circadian responses to light in blind and normally sighted human subjects will also be undertaken in order to specify the responsecharacteristics of the human photic system.  Potential: Enhancing our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the transduction of photic information by biological systems for the regulation of temporal physiology is a necessary prerequisite for elaborating future clinical strategies aimed at the improvement and treatment of chronobiological disorders.  We believe this approach will have a major impact in two areas of biology: 1) Light provides the primary environmental entraining agent (Zeitgeber) for most circadian systems, however this area of signal transduction remains poorly understood and the photoreceptors and the detailed nature of their connections with the central oscillator remain unknown. An understanding of these entrainment mechanisms is central to the understanding of circadian organization; 2) Lightprovides the most reliable means of manipulating circadian phase and hence re-aligning biological time with a new environmental phase. The ability to successfully manipulate biological time will have a profound impact on medicine timed drug administration, light treatments of chronobiological disorders, and ocular treatments. Specific benefits are expected to emerge from an understanding of the human circadian system and interaction between the fundamental, clinical, and industrial participants and consultants involved in the program.

704,215070,No,Gaussian entropic inequalities and uncertainty relations for communication and secure quantum key distribution,"Information and communication technologies are essential to modern society as the internet is pervading all aspects of our lives. Quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit to the communication rates. Determining this limit is one of the two challenges addressed by GENIUS. Given the amount of sensitive information sent through the internet, secure communications are essential to our society. To fulfill this need, the EU is investing in quantum key distribution (QKD) with the 1G€ Quantum Technology Flagship. The other challenge addressed by GENIUS is determining the maximum rate for secure communication that can be achieved by the forthcoming generation of QKD devices and proving their perfect security. To address the above challenges, I will firstly apply methods from functional analysis to prove new fundamental entropic inequalities for quantum Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels provide a mathematical model for the propagation of electromagnetic signals. Entropy is the core of information theory and quantifies the information content of a system. These inequalities will determine the maximum rates allowed by quantum mechanics for communication and QKD. Secondly, I aim to propose and prove a new fundamental entropic uncertainty relation for the heterodyne measurement. This uncertainty relation will prove the perfect security of the most promising QKD protocol. These new insights will have an enormous impact on both quantum communication and quantum cryptography and will stimulate what will be the first realization of quantum devices capable of communication and guaranteed perfectly secure QKD at the maximum possible rates.

798,95175,No,Semiconducting and Metallic nanosheets: Two dimensional electronic and mechanical materials,"We will develop simple, scalable methods to exfoliate layered compounds into monolayer nanosheets. These materials have exciting properties. Recently, graphene has taken the nanomaterials community by storm. However graphene is only one branch of a family of two dimensional layered compounds. Other examples include hexagonal BN, metal dichalcoginides such as MoS2 and metal oxides such as MnO2. We propose that all layered compounds can be exfoliated in certain solvents by the addition of ultrasonic energy. Such a method has not been demonstrated because the vast majority of solvents are unsuitable for this. We propose that suitable solvents can be identified by matching their surface energy to that of the nano crystal, rendering the exfoliation process energy neutral. This will open the gate to a wide range of nano-materials science and makes possible experiments that have been impossible using standard techniques. We will pick a set of layered compounds such as the semiconductors; hexagonal BN, MoS2 and TaO3 and the metals TaS2 and MnO2. We will learn to exfoliate these materials, studying the physics and chemistry of the solvent-nanosheet interaction. Once we can generate large volumes of highly exfoliated few-layer nanosheets at high concentration, we will study the physics of these materials. We will prepare free standing films of restacked sheets and polymer-sheet composites for mechanical applications. Thin films can also be studied as transparent conductors and capacitor dielectrics. Hybrid films can be used to devices such as photodetectors. Much more challenging will be the production of large quantities of monolayer nanosheets. We will learn to deposit nanosheets on substrates and measure their thickness and size with AFM. Semiconducting monolayers will be characterised by photoluminescence spectroscopy leading to a spectroscopic metric for monolayer population. By optimising the link between exfoliation procedure and monolayer population, we will develop methods to produce monolayer enriched samples.

712,200240,No,Open Sea Operating Experience to Reduce Wave Energy Cost,"Europe is endowed with abundant wave energy which could cover some 10% of its electricity needs with a clean, predictable and job-creating resource,  which EU companies are at the forefront exploiting with little dependence on foreign suppliers.  There remain important technical challenges to bring down costs to within investors’ reach, as a top priority open-sea operating experience must be analysed to permit the focus of R&D efforts on identifying and solving problems uncovered in open-sea deployments. However, to this day, most wave energy R&D does not have access to open-sea operating data as they are not shared by the companies that sponsored open-sea tests.   OPERA will remove this roadblock by collecting and sharing two years of open-sea operating data of a floating oscillating water column wave energy converter. In addition the project will be the first open-sea deployment for four cost-reducing innovations that will be advanced from TRL3-4 to TRL5. Together, these four innovations have a long-term cost reduction potential of over 50%. These are: a 50% more efficient turbine, latching and predictive control, a shared mooring system for wave energy similar to those that have reduced mooring costs 50% in aquaculture, and an elastomeric mooring tether that reduces peak loads at the hull-mooring connection 70% and thus addresses one of the most pressing challenges for structural survivability of wave energy devices.   Documenting and sharing this open-sea experience will also induce a step-change in our knowledge of risk and uncertainties, costs and societal and environmental impacts of wave energy. The consortium brings together world leaders in wave energy research from four European countries and the IPR owner and most advanced teams to exploit each of these innovations.

656,22780,No,BIOMASS PRODUCTION SYSTEM FOR THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF CAROTENOIDS,"This project aims to improve the biosynthesis of carotenoids through the development of a new environmentally friendly technology, cost effective production of natural carotenoids, which are increasingly important pigments and anti-oxidants widely used in Agro-food, pharmaceutics, cosmetics and Mealth-Food Industries. Different technologies for the production of microalgae biomass will be combined integrating two different systems:   1. the photobioreactors, where there is a fairly good knowledge in Europe (Britain, France and Italy), with pre-competitive results already described, which will be considered, and   2. the raceway pond systems, where extensive experience was developed in Israel and U.S.A., with commercial production facilities in operation, with whom technology transfer contacts have been initiated. The whole system, pioneered in Europe, will be applied to beta-carotene production using Dunaliella, and the photo-bioreactor, will be used for astaxanthin biosynthesis with Haematococcus.   The research will consist of a set of Tasks grouped into four Macro-Tasks:   1. MT l: Laboratory Scale Cultures;   2. MT 2: Process Scale up and Optimization.   3. MT 3: Analytical Development and Control.   4. MT 4: System Support and Management.   Those Macro-Tasks are interdependent and will be executed in parallel using a PERT approach for the actual management and control. All participants have a significant contribution for each of the Macro-Tasks which aims to fulfil a specific milestone. The expected results are:   1. a full cost-effective production system for the biosynthesis of natural carotenoids integrating all the laboratory to pilot-plant steps;   2. the knowledge to operate the system for the production of different carotenoids using different microalgae selected strains; and   3. the obtaining of high quality natural products, either in the form of microalgae powder or extracted carotenoids in vegetable oil solution. During the first year of work, the four laboratories participating in the project assembled laboratory scale culture equipment and built small scale raceway ponds. Medium scale ponds are already under use in Lisbon and the Algarve.   The analytical techniques to be used during the project have also mostly been set up, problems being found in terms of the very salty media used with Dunaliella. Development of protocols for carotenoid analysis has also caused problems.   One of the important points under consideration is the selection of the best strains in terms of growth and carotenoid production under the climatic conditions found in the south of Portugal. Some progress in this area has been made, but this remains a major concern. The development of culture conditions is also important, in terms of favouring growth of the chosen strains and, at the same time, discouraging growth of contaminants. It has already been concluded that carotenoid production has to be carried out under a different set of conditions from those favouring increase in biomass. Therefore the optimisation of both sets of conditions is necessary.   The separation of the cells, has also been a subject under study, with some innovative methods being tested. These include microfiltration and the natural migration of cells from a layer of high salt concentration to a less concentrated one.   The extraction of the carotenoid from the cells is also complex; experiments using supercritical extraction as well as conjugation of flocculation/oil extraction have been started. The best choice was found to be the extraction into vegetable oil. The important problem of preserving the carotenoids either within or outside the cells has also been investigated, with some promising results.   CONCLUSIONS   Although, during the first year of the project, important steps have been taken towards the economic production of carotenoids from microalgae, these are still mostly of infrastructural nature. This includes the installation of laboratory growth equipment and small and medium size raceway ponds. Various analytical procedures and technological operations have also been developed and will be used during the continuation of the project. This project is investigating the feasibility of large scale carotenoid production using microalgae such as Dunaliella and Haematococcus species. Studies cover both closed photobioreactors and raceway ponds, under the conditions found in Southern Europe. The research being carried out covers a number of interdependent tasks including laboratory scale cultures, process scale up and optimisation, as well as analysis and process control, system support and management. The anticipated final result is a complete cost effective production system for the biosynthesis of natural carotenoids integrating all the laboratory to pilot plant steps, as well as the knowledge to operate the system for the production of different carotenoids using strains of different microalgae selected. The final product may be produced either as a microalgae powder or as extracted carotenoids in vegetable oil solution.   This project aims to develop processes for the cost effective biosynthesis of carotenoids using algae. Carotenoids are important ingredients, widely used as pigments and anti oxidants in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and health food industries. Different technologies for the production of microalgae biomass are being studied. These integrate alternative systems based on either closed photobioreactors or raceway pond systems. Both are established technologies for algal production. The former have been quite widely used in Europe (Britain, France and Italy) whilst extensive experience of raceway systems has been built up in Israel and the United States. The complete raceway system will be developed to produce beta-carotene using Dunaliella, while the photo bioreactor system will be used for astaxanthin biosynthesis by Haematococcus.",0,0

377,218312,No,Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Detect & Prevent - Presymptomatic AD detection and prevention,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is central to the rapidly growing and crushing ageing challenge that threatens to economically undermine today’s health care system. AD prevalence will grow to over 100m cases in 2050. AD is incurable, but can be prevented. Detecting pre-symptomatic signs of AD in at-risk groups and intervening early may be the only viable solution. Our target is to bring to market a novel ICT tool, named ‘AD Shield’, that screens for and detects pre-symptomatic stage cognitive decline related to AD, and creates a personalized program for each individual user to strengthen weakened cognitive abilities, thus building cognitive reserve and reducing AD risk.

766,45733,No,Advanced long fiber reinforced melamine compounds for building products,"Task 1: Material development ARMECO unicolour and ARMECO granite look Remel, a commercial long fibre reinforced melamine-formaldehyde (MF) compound of DSM/Perstorp, was modified in order to be suitable for sanitary applications. This was achieved by using the right fillers and glass fibres and by adjusting the MF content, glass fibres content and fillers content. A granite look grade of ARMECO was developed by adding granules to the compound to enhance surface appearance. A new type of granules was developed to ensure a good adhesion between granules and resin. Thereby also preventing staining problems. Task 2: Development of production technology. The well known production technology for sheet moulding compounds (SMC) was modified and used for the application of granules in the material. Laboratory production runs showed that this new production technology is very suitable for the production of ARMECO material with a homogeneous and consistent distribution of granules. Several scale-up production runs done at a production plant also showed the feasibility of this production technology to produce ARMECO material on a production scale. Nevertheless, some scale-up problems were observed, but also recognized and judged as solvable. Task 3: Processing; moulding know how. The curing chemistry of Armeco differ from polyester based SMC; due to the condensation reaction a lot of water is produced. Therefore a venting step is required during moulding of Armeco; this is a key-factor for an optimal processing of Armeco. This was shown during the optimisation of moulding parameters for both physical and visual properties of large surface area Armeco mouldings. This resulted in very nice unicolour kitchensinks and acceptable large surface granite look panels. In order to improve the flow characteristics it is recommended to preheat the material. Due to the good mouldability of Armeco, it is possible to process Armeco on existing industrial equipment (if venting step can be applied). Objectives and content  General Project Goal: To develop a new type of material,  consisting of Melamine Formaldehyde resin, long glass  fibres (25 mm), inorganic fillers and additives  addressing the needs in the building market for products  with higher durability, increased hygiene, better  ergonomics, aesthetic design and appearance and easy  installation at a competitive price.  Motivation:  Materials like laminates, enamelled steel and painted  systems have a fundamental problem in the fact that their  surface performance is provided by a special layer bonded  on a backing material. Upon damaging repair is not  possible and the product performances deteriorate. Also  those systems are merely 2-dimensional. Newer so called  solid surface materials, like casted or extruded acrylate  systems, have intrinsically sufficient surface  performance and therefore do not need a special surface  layer. Their main drawback is the low mechanical  properties leading to products with excessive thickness,  weight and cost. Although they have some freedom of  design there are still severe limitations in this  respect. Unsaturated Polyester compounds have full  freedom of design and excellent mechanical properties.  They are reinforced with 25 mm glass fibres. However, in  contrary to Melamine Formaldehyde resins the matrix resin  is not durable.  The aim of this project is to develop a material which  is:   a solid surface material   based on Melamine Formaldehyde resin   long fibre reinforced   free flowing  This material will allow building products manufacturers  to design and produce products that fulfil all above  mentioned market needs. Possible ARMECO products are  worktops, sinks, vanity tops, shower trays and  accessories. The attainable market for ARMECO products  is estimated to be 220 MECU.

990,19610,No,Generating InStructional Text,"The GIST project addresses the construction of a multilingual generation system for texts describing bureaucratic procedures (e.g. how to apply for a social security facility, what to do in order to get visas, etc.) starting from language independent specifications. Three languages will be taken into consideration: English, German and Italian. The final prototype is expected to provide good quality drafts of texts; such drafts are then to be revised and post-edited by professional writers and/or translators.   The system is meant to significantly shorten and improve the process of production of  instructional texts. Also, the possibility of storing and reusing previously edited, language independent descriptions will improve the effectiveness of the GIST system. The prototype will constitute the starting point for a generation of systems for supporting the work on procedures in Public Administrations and in large companies. The idea is to embody the drafting functionality in an integrated system with several other functionalities for storing, retrieving and analysing  structured representations of procedures.   Approach and Methodology   A language independent specification will be provided by a user by means of a graphical interface, built on top of the knowledge representation system where the relevant domain knowledge is stored. The interface will feature facilities for assessing the consistency of the description, and for its storage and retrieval. The (language independent) description serves as input for a module that - for each language - produces a text plan which respects language- and domain-specific requirements. The text plan is translated into the format of a Sentence Plan Language, which serves as input specification for the tactical generators   The project is largely based on the re-use of existing technologies, mainly developed by the partners in the framework of national and international research programmes. Other than this, the development will be based on extensive empirical research.  Empirical investigations will address the occurrence and interdependence of discourse phenomena in the selected corpus of texts. They will also deal with the determination of needs of the text producers (domain experts, technical writers and translators) in their everyday work.  These examinations are made with respect to the three languages: English, German and Italian. The results of the empirical investigations will be stated in formal terms and will be represented in knowledge sources.  Another issue dealt with in the project is the identification of textual phenomena which are common to various languages, allowing a  common representation. Resource sharing is emphasized and redundancy avoided.   For the development of the final drafter prototype, the project is divided into the phases of requirements analysis, adaptation of tools, theoretical specifications and practical implementation of the drafter components, integration and evaluation. Users will be participating in various stages of the project by defining assessment criteria and evaluating  prototypes developed throughout the project.   Exploitation and Future Prospects   The development of the GIST system advances the state-of-the-art with respect to the following points:   multilinguality: different text-linguistic means can be used to express the same message in various language; these findings are encoded in the design of the GIST drafter, which produces texts which account for language-specific differences.  interrelationships between various textual phenomena: the project examines and formalizes the interactions between text structure and the textual phenomena of anaphoric reference and thematic progression. They are represented in the system by means of language-dependent and language-independent components.  user-participation: the potential users  are involved starting from the first phases of  the prototype development. The needs of technical writers and translators are therefore encoded in the system.  reusable knowledge sources: the knowledge sources developed in the course of the project will be represented in a modular and declarative way; this method facilitates the extension and adaptation of the prototype to new applications and new domains and also makes the components reusable for other NLP systems, like text understanding, machine translation or automatic abstracting systems.  relevant industrial application of prototype: the drafter prototype can be directly applied and easily extended to the generation of multilingual procedural texts as produced in Public Administration and large companies daily.   The use of the GIST system by the selected user groups (INPS, PAB) will have an important role in showing the benefits of applied Natural Language Processing to other users, especially Public Administrations in multilingual areas. The industrial partner (Quinary) will use the prototype to develop a marketable product for the drafting of multilingual texts, and promote it in areas concerned with multilingual documentation; new application areas and functionalities will be explored, as well as the integration of the prototype - or its subsequent developments - into more complex systems. The partners with a background in applied research (IRST, ITRI, OFAI) will be responsible for promoting, distributing and licensing the GIST system as a research prototype in the scientific community.    By means of further technological development,  different classes of systems for dealing with more complex procedural prescriptions can be derived from the GIST results. The drafting of text  integrated with pictures - allowing  the automatic drafting of  user manuals - and the integration of the functional description of components and devices with procedural descriptions - allowing the automatic drafting of manuals out of the formal model of the focused device - are among the envisaged GIST extensions.",0,0
580,82174,No,Role of Parathyroid Hormone related Protein (PTHrP) in endochondral bone development: Application as a possible marker for skeletal anomalies in fish,"The high incidence of larvae skeletal deformities is a significant problem in European marine aquaculture. This problem has a serious impact on the industry's productivity, on product quality and on animal welfare. The factors, which may cause skeletal anomalies in fish are largely unstudied, although in tetrapods there is ample evidence that PTHrP plays a significant role in both normal and abnormal development and growth of the skeleton. Preliminary studies carried out by the CME group indicate that PTHrP may be implicated in skeletal deformities, which arise as a consequence of altered chondrogenesis and calcification.  Thus, the fundamental scientific objective of this project is to investigate the importance of the unique hypercalcemic factor identified in fish, PTHrP, in endochondral bone development and its application as a possible marker for skeletal anomalies in fish. This will be achieved through the application of recombinant DNA and gene transfer technology as a tool for the induction of PTHrP gene over expression in fish embryos. The present project programme will therefore aim to establish unequivocally the role of PTHrP in chondrogenesis and skeletal development and link this to skeletal abnormalities. Several objectives have been identified which will contribute to the overall achievement of the aim.  Firstly, obtention of PTHrP expression construct and its microinjection into fertilized fish eggs; Secondly, assessment the ectopic expression of PTHrP in notochord cells of fish embryos and finally, evaluation the influence of PTHrP in the development of axial skeleton. Moreover, additional objectives of this research proposal are to promote the scientific development of the applicant and transfer the technology and knowledge acquired at the host institute during the visit to USA to the CME group at the return host institute. This will be important for the development of these groups' objectives but will also benefit the whole academic community.",0,0
667,93538,No,Merging Plasmonic and Silicon Photonics Technology towards Tb/s routing \nin optical interconnects,"PLATON aims to realize a fully integrated Tb/s optical routing system for data networks expecting to deliver important advantages to the end-users as it will enable high-speed communications and ultra-fast access to data information being stored at large computer centers whilst investing in a new technological platform of lower cost, lower power consumption and reduced size requirements. This will allow for the effective consolidation of today's Internet and computer server rooms storing huge amounts of information into smaller-size rack- or even box-interconnect environments. PLATON's routing fabric will employ novel plasmonic switching elements on a silicon motherboard and will develop novel fabrication processes for enabling the merger of plasmonics with silicon nanophotonics and electronics, targeting the combined utilization of small-footprint, high-bandwidth plasmonics structures with the low-loss functional potential offered by the more mature SOI technology. PLATON will evolve upon a whole new generation of miniaturized photonic components including: (a) a new series of fast 2x2 thermooptic plasmonic switches, (b) a small-footprint 4x4 thermooptic plasmonics switch, (c) an optically addressable 1x2 plasmonic switch operating at bitrates in excess of 10Gb/s, and (d) a 2x2 and a 4x4 Tb/s optical routing platforms. To this end, PLATON will pioneer the field of routing for optical interconnects and will provide a completely new technological toolkit, bringing Europe in a leading position world-wide with respect to research efforts in plasmonics for interconnects. Finally, it will open totally new application vistas and opportunities for European industry being active in the field of nanophotonics, given that the active participation of industry within PLATON ensures the industrial take up of the combined plasmonics/photonics functional devices from research elements to commercially available products.",0,0
153,207269,Yes,Cities Cooperating for Circular Economy,"The overall objective is to minimise the leakage of materials from the linear economy and work towards a circular economy. Specific objectives are to:  • Engage cities, enterprises, citizens and academia in 16 participatory value chain based partnerships to create and develop eco-innovative solutions together. • Develop 10 viable end-markets by demonstrating new applications for plastic waste, metals (EEE devices), biowaste and wood waste. • Develop a governance model for cities based on value chain based partnerships. • Develop decision support tools and assess the actual impact by use of Big Data. • Ensure replication through the FORCE Academy aiming at enterprises, citizens and policy makers. The eco-innovative solutions will be demonstrated across four cities (Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lisbon and Genoa) and using the four materials:  Flexible plastics: Recycling and upgrade of 5,000 tonnes of flexible plastic from enterprises and private households will enable virgin material substitution, corresponding to preventing emissions of 12,500 tonnes of CO2.  Metals: Citizens will be mobilised to reclaim an additional 2 kg/capita of WEEE (app. 3,600 tonnes). A communication campaign will reach 100,000 citizens and support at least five SME’s that repair damaged EEE devices so that 10-20% of the collected WEEE can be redistributed.  Wood waste: additional 12,000 tonnes wood waste from urban and mountain areas will be collected. 8-10,000 tonnes of brushwood will be used for compost production, and 14-16,000 tonnes will be processed into wood particles. Biowaste: around 7,000 tonnes of biowaste from the municipal mixed waste stream will be recovered: 3,000 tonnes coming from restaurants and hotels, and 4,000 tonnes coming from households.  The partnerships will result in the creation of viable eco-innovative market solutions, exploited by the partners.

138,110464,Yes,Durable biofilm-restraining surfaces and cleaning procedures for the food processing industry,"Efficient and safe food production is a prerequisite for building a society capable of feeding the growing population. With the world population growing at extraordinary rates and the consequent repercussions in the dietary and consumption habits, it is estimated that food production has to be increased at least by 70% in the next 30 years, with the looming threat of a proportional surge of food-borne diseases, which will occur predictably.  This is particularly true for the most striking cause of these outbreaks, to which the food industry did not seem to have found effective counter-measures so far: biofouling, which is the contamination of surfaces with hygienically relevant microorganisms and their eventual development and implementation into biofilms .  There is currently not a thorough, effective and integrated solution to eliminate biofouling completely. This has a negative impact both on the economic performances of the enterprises and on their image, affecting product quality and quantity, forcing preventive overdosing of biocides and cleaners, and causing production downtime for cleaning and disinfection cycles.  The food industry needs to improve anti-fouling strategies and to effective implement them into the production process.  The CLEANSURF project will attack the biofouling through the development of new durable surface coatings to reduce biofilm build-up and facilitate the removal of biofilm and through fine-tuning of the cleaning process to suit the new surfaces.  The CLEANSURF project will develop and test coatings with biofilm restraining properties tailor-made for the food industry in order to: 1)increase effectiveness and productivity by expanding the cleaning intervals and by decreasing the down-time of production equipment enforced by current cleaning procedures; 2)reduce the usage of environmentally harmful chemicals; 3)reduce the energy and water consumption. The coating will be an organic/hybrid silane based coating manufactured by the Sol-Gel approach.  The growing of the food production and consumption represents a huge market opportunity for European companies going into global markets with a competitive edge achieved also through the Cleansurf innovation.",1,1
372,98739,No,Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Random Matrices: a model for the Anderson Transition from String Theory,"One of the new developments in theoretical physics of the past few years has been the application of concepts of string theory to condensed matter systems, the AdS/CFT duality being a prime example of it.  Matrix models provide a similar opportunity. In fact, they are ubiquitous in virtually every branch of theoretical physics: from nuclear to condense matter physics, from 2-D quantum gravity to number theory, from statistical physics to string theory, and so on. Even if the physical interpretation of the matrices in the various fields can be quite different, they all share the same mathematical formulation, which makes the possibility of cross-fertilization between the different areas very fruitful.  The aim of this project is the study of a class of non-standard matrix models within the context of condensed matter physics, by taking advantage of existing results from string theory. These models, known as weakly confined, are characterized by potentials that asymptotically grow like a log-square and thus do not belong to the (polynomial) Wigner-Dyson universality class, but are still exactly solvable through their orthogonal polynomials.  One of the main reasons of interest is that they present a spontaneous breaking of rotational invariance and could therefore be an excellent candidate for studying analytically the Anderson transition between a conducting and an insulating phase, a long standing problem with several experimental applications.  Interestingly, models with this asymptotic behavior have been recently considered in the field of topological strings and ABJM theory, but these results have not been translated yet to the condensed matter community and can provide new tools to understand the SSB mechanism.  The M.I.T. environment is a perfect and unique place to pursue this kind of research, due to the presence of leading experts in the different areas of physics involved, several of them already involved in similar lines of research.",0,0

We aim to open the new research horizon in integration of genetics, glycomics, and epigenomics datasets into systems biology by developing innovative methods for high throughput omics and for integrative analysis of omics data. We focus on ageing, which is the biggest single risk factor for many diseases. By application of our novel methods to emerging datasets representing inflammation and immunology, IMforFUTURE will contribute to understanding of the underlying biological processes involved in diseases and ageing. To be successful in future multidisciplinary environments in Academia or Industry, ESRs need to be able to act as bridge between several diverse disciplines. Our ESRs need to overview all steps from data production via data analysis to data interpretation.

In the agri-food industry and wastewater treatment plants, anaerobic digestion is a proven technology for treatment of wet-waste biomass, which allows generation of biogas as renewable energy. Additionally, biogas can be upgraded into biomethane and CO2, which are organic carbon sources which can be used as raw materials for manufacturing graphene in a circular economy approach: biographene. We are Biogenera Renovables, and we have developed a plug-and-play solution for producing graphene from biomethane in biogas plants via Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). We have a working prototype of the technology (now TRL6) in collaboration with PlanarTech, another R&D intensive SME key in graphene industrialisation, and we are finetuning an innovative business model to have a long-term leadership. Our business model consists in partnering with biogas plants to install our Biographene Production Unit in their premises, as well as sharing the profits of the sales. It will allow graphene production to be economically viable at industrial scale and simultaneously is a way to increase the profitability of biogas plants and boost the renewable energy sector. To market it, we will explore how to collaborate with PlanarTech. Our breakthrough technology coupled with the business model proposed has the potential of transforming the industrial production of graphene, whose high-quality production will be sold to technological industry, and its low-quality fraction will be sold to packaging industry, which is currently highly interested in incorporating graphene to strengthen their materials (reinforcing paper pulp for bags). From 2022 to 2026, 12 BioGraphene production units will be installed, which will imply the growth of Biogenera Renovables in terms of personnel (28 new positions will be directly created) and revenues, with 1.7 M€ of net profits",1,1
895,6288,No,OPTIMIZATION OF CERAMIC ZIRCONIA POWDERS FOR THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS IN IC ENGINES AND GAS TURBINES,"The objectives of the project are as follows: a study of spray drying, including characterisation of starting powders and powders produced; a study of the plasma densification process in air, underwater, and in a controlled atmosphere; the production of these characteristics on the plasma spray process and the coating properties; the reproducibility and reliability of the powder production.  Yttria powder and magnesia stabilised zirconia powder have been processed by spray drying. A densification process of the agglomerated particles shows a dense structure with a smooth spherical surface. Parameters and spraying criteria for coating production have been developed. The microstructure of the deposits meets the aerospace standards. With round robin tests, ceramographic methods are developed to obtain reproducible results in coating characterisation. The coatings produced are tested and characterised by thermal behaviour, corrosion, internal stresses, thermal shock and bond strength properties.  In the field of production of thermal barrier coatings from ceramic zirconia powders, the following research has been conducted: a study of spray drying, including the characterization of the starting and resulting powders; a study of the plasma densification in air, under water and in a controlled atmosphere; characterization of densified powders; coating production by optimization of spraying and correlation with powder characteristics; development of ceramographic methods to obtain reproducible results; characterization of coatings by standard metallographic and X-ray techniques, as well as the measurement of physical properties and their correlation with powder characteristics; testing of coating properties (corrosion, bond strength, thermal shock, etc) and correlation with powder characteristics.  It is possible to produce dense, globular composite powders with the desired particle size distribution. The production routes can be applied to powders other than zirconia composites.  A new production route has been developed for the production of globular dense composite zirconia powders which can be produced in a predefined particle size range. Spray drying and plasma densification of the spray dried powders are the major steps with the powders produced by underwater plasma densification and transferred arc densification exhibiting particularly good flowability. This outstanding flowability makes the powders very suitable for plasma spraying of thermal barrier coatings.  The coatings produced using these powders have been investigated with respect to their structure and their mechanical and thermal properties, and have been shown to be at least as good as those produced using commercially available powders. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ADAPT THE PLASMA SPRAY TECHNIQUE TO IC ENGINES BY STUDYING CAREFULLY THE MATERIAL POINT OF VIEW. THE SPECIFIC INNOVATIC VALUE OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE THREEFOLD:  1) THE PRODUCTION OF POWDERS WITH KNOWN CHARACTERISTICS; 2) THE INFLUENCE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ON THE SPRAYING PROCESS AND THE COATING PROPERTIES LIKE CORROSION BEHAVIOUR, MECHANICAL PROPERTIES;3) THE REPRODUCIBILITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE POWDER PRODUCTION.

The goal of this is to improve the strength, toughness and environmental stability of the composites prepared with the resized fibre. The specific sizing will be developed for non woven mat and chopped tow of recycled carbon fibres. The new upgraded recycled carbon fibre will be used to produce new composites with cementitious or polymeric matrices (thermoset and thermoplastic).  The proposed strategy is the development of specific sizings for different polymeric and cementitious matrices through the incorporation of coupling agents along with the sizing materials, which through different mechanisms (covalent bond, hydrogen bond, Van der Waals interactions...) will create active points at the CF surface. Those will be responsible for chemical interactions with the matrix. New approaches as the use of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silesquioxanes (POSS), which consist of a rigid organic cubic silica-oxygen core surrounded by eight organic groups, will be used. CUSTOMISIZE also proposes to validate Steam Water Thermolysis, a current method to recycle CF, in the process to introduce chemical functionalities on the fibers that will be able to interact with the sizing. In addition, plasma viability will be studied due to its capability to create new chemical functionalities on fibers and also, the advantages that has compared to industrial electrochemical processes. It is expected to increase the interfacial shear strengths (IFSS) between rCF and the different matrices by up to 90%. A detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the materials and processes will be carried out.

A co-ordinating function will be developed which will be responsible for co-ordination of the panels of standardised sera, data management, epidemiological analysis and the development of mathematical models.",0,0
468,107414,No,Plant Cell Wall Dynamics During Cell Cycle,"Unlike in animals, the formation and growth of the plant body is strongly influenced by the presence of a rigid structure encapsulating the cell – the cell wall. Plant development must therefore be coordinated with the synthesis and remodelling of highly complex cell wall structure. Cell elongation and cell division are the two main processes which give rise to the plant body. Whilst cell wall properties during cell elongation have been relatively well studied on Arabidopsis hypocotyls and on Chara internodes, description of cell wall behaviour associated with cell division is largely absent. DNA microarray data on synchronous cell cultures suggest up-regulation of many cell wall component acting enzymes in particular points of the cell cycle. Moreover, the concept of plant cytokinesis supposes structural changes in cell walls. We propose to use the state of art technologies in cell, developmental biology and systems biochemistry to describe cell wall related processes in dividing cells. As model systems we will use Arabidopsis plants and cell cultures but also a broad panel of algae, land plants and crop species. Our work will incorporate detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses of the dynamism of the cell wall components and related enzymatic activities at different stages of the cell cycle. We will also employ state of art microscopic and ultramicroscopic techniques to study the spatiotemporal distribution of the cell wall components. This approach will include development of novel technology for in situ and real time detection of various carbohydrates. We will also analyse cellular and developmental consequence of the loss- and gain-of action of the cell cycle regulated cell wall-acting enzymes to get the functional information of molecular pathways leading to proper cell division. Our project thus aims to address fundamental questions regarding plant development at uni- and multicellular level within the evolutionary perspective.",0,0

730,75941,No,Control and prevention of emerging and future pathogens at cellular and molecular level throughout the food chain,"Food safety is of fundamental importance to the European consumer, food industry and economy. The impact on trade and competitiveness is very substantial. Despite significant investment the incidence of food derived disease still increases in the EU. PathogenCombat attacks this pan-European problem through a holistic, multidisciplinary approach towards threats from new/emerging pathogens in the entire food chain. A number of advanced platforms will be developed to investigate the survival and virulence expression of pathogens in feed and food, and on contact surfaces in the food chain including the intestinal tract of farm animals. The platforms, of which several are used for the first time in food safety studies, comprise bioimaging, laser tweezers, phage display/convergent evolution, functional mammalian cell models, functional genomics and microarrays. New/emerging food borne bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi and viruses are targeted for milk and dairy products, poultry and pigs and their meat products. The key deliverables are: -Food with none or acceptably low levels of pathogens, -New methods to detect and predict the occurrence of viable pathogens and their virulence in the food chain and at the time of consumption, -Control methods to eliminate biofilms based upon hygienic design and processing, -Novel processing technologies to inactivate pathogens, -New probiotic and protective cultures to eliminate pathogens, -Pathogen control optimisation throughout the food chain based upon mathematical modelling, -New cost effective Food Safety Management System, -Unified awareness of food safety for the European consumers, food industries and regulatory agencies. A distinctive aspect of this Project is to facilitate proactive, more coherent, effective and flexible responses to new/emerging pathogens. The deliverables will be widely exploited by SMEs to produce safe food and improve the health and well being of Europeans and the competitiveness of the food industry...",0,0
680,201387,No,Palm hydraulics linking biodiversity and functioning of tropical forests under climate change,"How do biodiversity and ecosystem functioning respond to climate change? Currently, fundamental knowledge gaps prevent us from answering this most pressing question. Global climate is largely dependent on tropical forest functioning due to the scale of plant-driven ecosystem services that they provide (water and carbon cycling). Thus, research on tropical plants is essential to address the question. However, critical plant groups such as palms, which are hyperdominant in tropical forests, remain almost entirely neglected. The intricate relationship between plants and the environment is mediated by functional traits, but current models do not yet account for the dynamics of species and functional composition and thus fail to predict plant/climate responses accurately. This critical knowledge gap is the primary focus of PALMHYDRAULICS. The project will use palms as a model group to explore hydraulic traits, which are pivotal in plant/climate responses, but unstudied in palms, despite their importance. PALMHYDRAULICS will focus on the structure, ecology and evolution of palm hydraulic functioning. Through a novel, integrated research programme, PALMHYDRAULICS will use cutting-edge analyses to disentangle the role of trade-offs in plant hydraulic structure relating to species diversification, intraspecific variation, structural development and individual survival that underpin feedback mechanisms between plant effect on and responses to climate change. This comprehensive, ambitious approach builds on the world leadership of the host institution in integrated studies of the palm family, plant morphology and evolution, its unrivalled collections, and the complementary expertise of the host scientists and experienced researcher. Novel and extensive datasets will be produced and made openly accessible, and findings will be disseminated through the most prestigious scientific journals and a comprehensive public communication plan.",0,0
107,222973,Yes,Efficient and Stable Blue Quasi-2D Halide Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes,"Within eight years, metal halide perovskite materials become a new class of semiconducting materials for optoelectronic device application. Their unique and attractive optoelectronic properties, e.g., high crystallinity, low-cost, solution processable with large area deposition, direct band gap nature, low defect density, high color purity (narrow PL emission), tunable optical bandgap,  long diffusion length, and balance and high charge carrier mobility. These properties make them attractive and potential candidates for light emitting diodes (LEDs) also. The green and red emissive perovskite-based LEDs efficiency reached ~10%, which is equal to the organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) at lab scale.  But still, blue emissive PeLED efficiency is lower as compared to green and red PeLEDs. The poor stability, poor charge balance, and low photoluminescent are major problems to limit blue PeLED efficinecy.  In this proposal, I aims to address these challenges and demonstrate efficient and stable blue PeLED. The research work will be organized according to the following key objectives. 1) Design of blue emissive quasi 2D perovskite material by first-principles calculation (with the support of host organization), b) Deposition of high quality and pinhole-free blue quasi 2D thin film by using various deposition method and their characterization, and c) Fabrication of efficient and stable blue emissive quasi 2D PeLED beyond state of the art, by using device engineering and device physics investigation. This project provides basic scientific knowledge of quasi 2D perovskite materials for blue emissive PeLEDs.  The expected results of this project are bandgap engineering of quasi 2D perovskite materials for blue emission with good optoelectronic properties, efficient and stable blue PeLED. Also, I will learn the synthesis of quasi 2D materials from the host organization that will be improved my interdisciplinary knowledge and research skills. The efficient blue PeLED is us",0,1
507,52404,No,"Education and training for governance and active citizenship in europe: analysis of adult learning and design of formal, non-formal and informal educational intervention strategies","This project provides a scientific basis for educational interventions to involve European citizens more actively in shaping their own futures. It analyses how European adults have learned active citizenship, and what factors leads to effective formal, non-formal and informal citizenship education. the premise is that attitudes, skills and behavioural patterns required by citizenship roles are not learned primarily through formal education, but mainly informally - constructed in socio-institutional and cultural processes. An innovative theoretical model incorporates dimensions of agency (affectivity, responsibility, identity), domains (work, state, civil society, private), and modes of intervention (formal, non-formal, informal). Documentary analysis, life history and focus group methods provide comparable data from six European countries on policy and its history, on how active citizenship is learned, and on intervention strategies. Participative methods integrate policy-makers, professionals and other end-users closely in the research. Such strong professional and citizenship network links are central to dissemination of findings.",0,0
1021,40312,No,Transformations of inorganic constituents leading to slagging and fouling in a cotton ginning residues fired combined heat and power plant,"The use of agricultural residues (cotton ginning residues, wheat straw, wood chips, corn stacks) as a fuel in a CHP plant has the advantage of improving the energy efficiency of the plant while at the same time avoids the necessity of their disposal. The use, however, of such an unconventional fuel has the drawback of slagging and fouling in the combustor of the plant which leads to reduced operation efficiency and high maintenance costs. The main aims of the intended project are :  -To define the partitioning of inorganic constituents associated with raw fuel particles among product (including vapours, aerosols and residual char/ash particles) formed under conditions relevant to utility flames as a function of their specific (intrinsic and extrinsic) characteristics and the environment in which the transformation occurs and to finally characterize the resultant spectrum of products.  - To elucidate and quantify the fundamental processes involved in the transformation of inorganic constituents which will lead to minimum slagging and fouling predicament.  - To develop, based on the information acquired in the previous points, a tractable 'process' model capable of predicting the significant features of the transformation process, and most importantly, the nature and distribution of ash minerals.  - To design, develop, manufacture and test a CHP plant fired on cotton ginning residues.",1,0
885,70943,No,GMO CRMs and biometrology,"Specific Objectives: 1. To produce certified reference materials for at least all GMOs approved in Europe. To attempt to provide reference materials for GMOs released outside of the EU. To further optimise production methods and types of reference materials with regard to their use in collaboration with expert laboratories and authorities of the Member States, Candidate Countries and with international partners; 2.

To train scientists from the EU and Candidate Countries on the production of GMO certified reference materials and to promote metrology in biochemical measurements. Anticipated milestones and schedule Completion of a feasibility study for the production of rapeseed reference materials which cannot be produced the same way as the GMO CRMs produced so far: 07/2003 Completion of certification campaign of newly produced Bt-11 and Bt-176 CRMs: 04/2003 Completion of certification campaign of 3 to 5 other GMO CRMs in average 6 months after delivery of the raw materials Completion of the first BIPM pilot study on quantitative PCR: 09/2003  Planned Deliverables: 1.1 Possibly, production of maize GMO (GA21; NK-603, T25) and rape seed (Topas 19/2, Falcon GC40/90, Liberator). Other GMOs expected to enter or to complete the approval process and then consequently to be considered for reference material production are e.g., MON 809 maize, GA 21 maize, MON810xT25 maize, A5/15 beat, TGt-F tomato and IEH 92-527-1 potato.

Within the limitations created by legal and intellectual property issues, it will also attempt to provide reference materials for GMOs released outside of the EU in order to allow control of imports. The action will demonstrate fitness for purpose of these materials and will support international ring trials to validate methods to be used in international trade. The impact of food processing and the applicability of certain types of reference material will be further investigated. In the area of biometrology, this action will collaborate with relevant expert networks and professional organisations, which are indispensable for efficient measurement standardisation and implementation of reference measurement systems. The JRC is a founding member in the Bioanalysis Working Group set up by the Bureau International des Poids et Measures (BIPM) where it represents the European Commission. This group comprises the world's leading metrology institutes. The major issue to be addressed by this Working Group is how to achieve a satisfactory degree of measurement equivalence and comparability of data worldwide to support free trade and consumer protection. The JRC contributes in particular by developing concepts for reference systems, by addressing the issue of uncertainty calculation for quantitative measurements and by developing certified reference materials for biological and biochemical analysis.  This action will participate in, and, where appropriate, organise, BIPM and EUROMET Pilot Studies and Key Comparisons dedicated to important bioanalytical issues. It will also produce certified reference materials by using innovative concepts making use of the rapid advances in biotechnology. This action offers training possibilities since IRMM is the leading institute producing GMO certified reference materials and is promoting metrology also in biochemical measurements. Rationale The availability of reference materials for GMOs is of utmost importance for the performance of quantitative GMO measurements and consequently for the implementation of EU legislation related to GMO. This requires the development of production methods and proper means for the characterisation of various types of GMOs and reference materials. However, the production of any GMO certified reference material in the future will depend on the provision of suitable raw materials and on the clarification of the legal implication related to its distribution. So far, the production of new materials and the replacement of exhausted batches were delayed or made impossible by the non- availability of raw materials. In addition, some GMO producers have started to link the provision of raw materials and/or the signature of distribution agreements to the pending approval of GMO in Europe. This situation is absolutely not under JRC's control.  Biometrology is the application of metrological principles and the development of reference systems for biological and biochemical measurements. It now relies on newly described biomarkers explored by functional genomics and proteomics techniques. The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has set up a Working Group on Bioanalysis comprising the world's leading metrology institutes, where JRC has been a founding member and represents the European Commission.",1,0
152,100953,Yes,Two-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for the Exploration of Biomolecular Dynamics,"The paradigm of the structure-function relationship in proteins is outdated. Biological macromolecules and supramolecular assemblies are highly dynamic objects. Evidence that their motions are of utmost importance to their functions is regularly identified. The understanding of the physical chemistry of biological processes at an atomic level has to rely not only on the description of structure but also on the characterization of molecular motions. The investigation of protein motions will be undertaken with a very innovative methodological approach in nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation. In order to widen the ranges of frequencies at which local motions in proteins are probed, we will first use and develop new techniques for a prototype shuttle system for the measurement of relaxation at low fields on a high-field NMR spectrometer. Second, we will develop a novel system: a set of low-field NMR spectrometers designed as accessories for high-field spectrometers. Used in conjunction with the shuttle, this system will offer (i) the sensitivity and resolution (i.e. atomic level information) of a high-field spectrometer (ii) the access to low fields of a relaxometer and (iii) the ability to measure a wide variety of relaxation rates with high accuracy. This system will benefit from the latest technology in homogeneous permanent magnet development to allow a control of spin systems identical to that of a high-resolution probe. This new apparatus will open the way to the use of NMR relaxation at low fields for the refinement of protein motions at an atomic scale. Applications of this novel approach will focus on the bright side of protein dynamics: (i) the largely unexplored dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins, and (ii) domain motions in large proteins. In both cases, we will investigate a series of diverse protein systems with implications in development, cancer and immunity.",0,1
389,2932,No,Centralized facility for the concerted action on DNA : probe bank for the European human gene mapping project,"The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe bank facility undertook to distribute approximately 920 markers over the 24 month period. The markers were to be distributed in batches of 5 to 6 markers per laboratory at regular intervals. The actual total weighted value of the markers sent out was 1008 probe equivalents, which slightly exceeded the commitment.   The acquisition of existing DNA probes not tested on Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) families was initially very important, but it is become less so now, as most new markers published are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) formatted. Also, 36 minisatellite markers were received for inclusion in the project. Their current screening programme has resulted in the detection of a number of polymorphic trinucleotide repeats which will be used at a later stage.  The number of new PCR based markers published are steadily increasing and the informative value is usually very high.   Mononucleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences have been identified from the European Molecular Biology Library (EMBL) and GenBank sequence databases. The sequences containing repeats were entered into a programme called Primers used to selected PCR primer sets flanking the repeat sequences to that they fulfil certain selection criteria. The PCR primers selected were assessed and those judged most suitable were synthesized. Amplification of human DNA from random unrelated individuals and CEPH families were carried out.  Single chromosome Bluescript libraries were screened for positive clones using a synthetic (AAAT) 15 oligonucleotide.   The task of ensuring that the membranes sent out to each laboratory corresponded to the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) detected by the probes sent out has been the responsibility of the Probe Resource Centre.   For data collection 24 Unix workstations, and a Pascal compiler licence were obtained for LINKAGE use and motif was added as an enhanced user interface. The GENBASE software for data management is tightly bound to the project. The European Human Gene Mapping Project (EUROGEM) is funded by the European Commission as a collaborative effort to produce a high density linkage map of the human genome. The project is organized as two centralized facilities supplying the 22 network laboratories with the necessary resources (markers and DNA) for linkage studies.   One of these two resource centres is based at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) in Paris. Its role is to supply the participating laboratories with DNA from 40 three-generation families. The other resource centre is based at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in South Mimms, UK. This centre prepares and supplies the markers to be typed across the families. Two types of markers are supplied: DNA probes for Southern blotting and primers for analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).   In the initial 24 months of the project, over 1800 markers will be screened by the participating laboratories. Approximately half of the markers will be provided by the probe resource centre; the individual laboratories will supply the rest.   In addition to the preparation and distribution of markers, the probe resource centre is also involved in isolating new markers, and in acquiring informative markers, which have been published in scientific literature, from the originators. In the isolation of new markers two approaches are being used. In the first approach, short repeat sequences have been identified from sequence databases and screened for polymorphic length variation by PCR. The second approach is to screen phage and cosmid libraries, either for polymorphic variation of short nucleotide repeats (as above) or with a synthetic decanucleotide probe which detects areas of high variability. The clones identified with this probe are highly likely to detect variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in Southern blot analysis.   Both screening programmes have been set up and positive clones have been identified for further analysis. The work is expected to lead to the discovery of a number of new markers when the material has been fully analyzed.",0,0
63,109495,Yes,Integrated water treatment in a one-stage oxidative-adsorptive process to degrade and remove harmful substances,"Current costs for industrial wastewater treatment in Europe are already an economic burden and are expected to rise. With 4.5 billion Euros spent each year this is restricting the growth of the European production sector, especially in water scarce areas where there is a pressing need to reuse water. OxFloc aims to reduce treatment costs by at least 30% while offering modular installation and application engineering at a price below comparable State-of-Art processes. OxFloc systems will have a quantified superior environmental benefit, a smaller plant footprint, lower operation costs and enable 100% water recycling as they work without salt-carrying chemicals. Not all industrial wastewaters are the same, but many carry a mix of toxic chemicals, non-biodegradable components and hormones e.g. tenside, flame resistants, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and heavy metals. Therefore, industrial effluents need significant treatment before they can be discharged to a municipal waste water treatment plant. Typically the pollutants exist with suspended particles, requiring a clearing pretreatment which increases cost and energy consumption of current treatments. Our system solves this problem by combining particle removal and adsorption with advanced oxidation. Our OxFloc system is a one-stage combined flocculation-oxidation process that needs no chemicals because electrolytic production of the iron catalyst, as well as hydrogen peroxide, takes place in the reactor itself. It is an integrated system capable of degrading and removing both dissolved and suspended harmful substances from industrial wastewaters using only electrical energy. It will be fully compatible with power from renewable energy sources, conventional supply or from smart power grids balancing demand and offer of electrical energy. It can be utilised by over 265,000 SME-businesses in Europe for water treatment and recovery making them more sustainable and competitive.",1,1
100,34590,Yes,NON-TOXIC AMINOPLASTIC ADHESIVE FOR MEDIUM DENSITY FIBREBOARD AND NEW APPLICATION PANEL PRODUCTS OF IMPROVED WEATHER AND BIOLOGICAL RESISTANCE,"The annual production of particleboard and medium density fibrebroad in the EU amounts to some 26 million m3, mostly bonded with urea-formaldehyde adhesives. As the adhesives cost from 20-30 % of the final product costs, they are crucial in determining profitability in a highly competitive industry. Urea-formaldehyde bonded products emit formaldehyde in service. The health effects of this substance has led to regulations limiting in emission (it must be lower than 6.5 mg/100 of board of Germany). Alternative adhesive-routes proposed were not able to solve the problems of health risk, high production cost and impaired board performance. In parallel, another problem of wood-based panels has always been their poor preservation.  The main objective of this project is the development of a low to zero formaldehyde emission aminoplastic resin of improved weather an biological resistance to be used in the production of medium density fibreboard (DMF), particleboard and other wood-based panels. The synthesis route of such an adhesive, the parameters of its manufacture as well as its application conditions in panels production will be determined and optimised.  The process of this project addresses all the above problems by using the following techniques :  - copolymerization of the aminoplastic resin with long chain aliphatic primary  diamines/triamines and polyamines (nylons), in order to improve the water  resistance and lower the formaldehyde emission of the resin; - resin cross-linking by the use of hexamethylenetetramine in the presence of natural and synthetic colloids to further reduce the formaldehyde emission and; - incorporation in the adhesive of an easily diffusable non-toxic preservative such as boron, to improve board resistance to fungal attack.  The combination of these principles with already established technology and practices for low formaldehyde emission aminoplastic resins will be used to synthesise the new resins and test their behaviour in the production of lab scale panels. The best resin system obtained will be optimised regarding its manufacturing parameters and application conditions. The biological testing on the boards produced will be carried out in parallel. Pilot scale tests will follow in order to transfer the new technology to the semi-industrial level and to verify the lab results.  The production of resins capable of imparting to the wood-based panels and more particularly to MDF improved water/weather resistance, very low to zero formaldehyde emission as well as biological resistance will be realized using an environmentally friendly process. This will be ensured by :  - the use of natural colloids in the reaction of the resin with hexamethylenetetramine; - the incorporation of a non-toxic preservative; - the aim to produce a resin with zero formaldehyde emission.",1,1
420,96058,No,Combating unlawfully gained profits using Private Law mechanisms in Europe,"“This Court never allows a man to make profit by a wrong”. Unfortunately, this famous statement from Lord Hatherly in Jegon v. Vivian (1870-1871) (Law Reports Chancery Appeal Cases VI, p. 742, 761) is nowadays no more than a wish and does not reflect the present day reality. As a matter of fact, the tortfeasor can often keep his unlawfully gained profits (e.g. the tortfeasor cannot be detected, no sufficient provisions for claiming damages exist, rational apathy of the injured person etc.) which can run up to immense sums and lead to inefficient markets. The research project ultimately wants to find the most efficient Private Law instruments for combating these unlawfully gained profits and thus enhance the efficiency of the markets for the following sectors: Intellectual Property Law, Unfair Competition Law, Antitrust Law and finally Capital Market Law. In order to reach this goal the research project makes use of the Acquis Communautaire approach, Comparative Law approach, Law and Economics and Behavioural Science and Law. To reach this goal the scholar first needs to detect the situations in which unlawfully gained profits remain with the wrongdoer; followed by an appraisal of all Private Law instruments (as e.g. collective actions or skimming-off procedures) existing at the European and national level combating unlawfully gained profits (Acquis Communautaire and Comparative Law approach). As a third step, the existing inefficiencies of the European and national Private Law mechanisms will be detected (Law and Economics) and as the penultimate step, the practical application of these instruments (Behavioural Science and Law) will be analysed. Under consideration of all findings from the aforementioned research methods and approaches the proposed project then wants, as a final research objective, to make concrete proposals for better legislating in the field of research at European and national level.",0,0
129,199998,Yes,Rationally designed nanostructured catalysts for bio-conversion systems: assessing the innovation potential of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) powder/particle coatings for the catalyst market,"The introduction of biomass-derived feedstocks for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals brings new challenges to the chemical industry: the conventional heterogeneous catalysts used in past petrochemical operations often cannot be adopted. Demanding operation conditions cause extensive deactivation problems, while in the same time material scarcity is severely pressing for advances in the utilization efficiency of the active catalyst materials.  The understanding of the interplay between agglomeration and coating during Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) in combination with the expansion of the surface nanostructuring options to carbon materials (ERC-StG: AggloNanoCoat) renders a new class of rationally-designed catalysts available. Nanostructuring precision in fabrication results in materials with an engineered structure-performance behaviour, effectively addressing performance-related issues (e.g. stability/selectivity) while using minimum amounts of scarce elements.  Switching to a gas-phase technique for catalyst manufacturing has the potential to enable a cleaner way of production and a significant abatement of energy and waste footprints of the process. The foreseen profitability boost – while addressing societal requirements for optimal use of scarce resources in more efficient production schemes – can justify the transition in technology.  The nanoCARBS project aims to realize the innovation potential of ALD for the production of nanostructured Catalysts as Rational Bio-conversion Systems in a scalable way. Taking the necessary pre-commercialization steps will enable us to demonstrate the benefits of the technology for an industrially-relevant catalyst product. Setting-up a business strategy will allow the commercialization of the technology initially in the field of catalyst industry.",1,1
48,44760,Yes,COST-EFFECTIVE FABRICATION OF COMPONENTS BY MEDIUM PRESSURE INJECTION MOULDING,"There is a need for high quality net-shape ceramic and metal parts fabricated in small to medium-size volumes but, at the unit cost of large-scale production. The existing production technologies, based on powder injection moulding (PIM), have certain limitations to reach the large scale markets of low-to-medium cost parts. GOCERAM has during the last years been developing modified technology and, simultaneously, been designing suitable corresponding machinery to meet this goal, based on Medium Pressure Injection Moulding (MPIM).The MPIM technology offers manufacturers potential for 1/ better profit margin, 2/ possibility of manufacturing certain parts in cases where the limitations of other techniques exclude commercially sound production and 3/ a competitive alternative to machining or investment casting.The objective of the project is to demonstrate the potential of MPIM technology through highly qualified European R&D centres (ENSCI/CTTC, Limoges, France, and Fraunhofer Institute IKTS, Dresden, Germany). They, in addition, possess unique and complementary know-how for binder engineering and de-binding of the moulded parts using supercritical extraction, respectively. The project partner companies are potential manufacturers and users of specific parts. The centres will demonstrate manufacturing of prototype products using GOCERAM with the objective of achieving optimum production characteristics. After this stage, it will be easier for the companies to make decision on further commercial exploitation.Furthermore, the project will provide references for further diffusion of the technology within the European industry, especially among less experienced producers. By creating a powerful link between an equipment manufacturer and a basic technology supplier (GOCERAM), the major competent R&D centres and the potential client industries, this effort is anticipated to be highly beneficial to the European industry.",0,1

225,47013,Yes,Chrome-teflon surface coating for process rollers,"This project is concerned with fluoropolymer coated rollers and drying cylinders such as those used for the production of paper, paper products and textiles. Fluoropolymer coatings are essential in these industries due to their excellent non stick, low friction properties which allow the production rollers to operate at high speeds without creating friction or contamination of the final product due to sticking of production materials such as size and other additives. The aim of the project is to effect cost savings in the paper, paper products and textile industries through the development of an improved coating for production plant rollers. The project will develop an advanced roller coating with improved wear resistance to better withstand the aggressive treatment meted out in the production environment. This new coating material will be based on a composite material of fluoropolymer and chrome metal and is estimated to increase the lifetime of current fluoropolymer roller coatings tenfold from approximately 1 year to 10 years. The utilisation of this new technology in paper and textile plants across Europe will bring a number of economic benefits. The replacement of fluoropolymer roller coatings in situ will vastly improve the efficiency and reduce the production costs in these industries, where the replacement of roller coatings currently causes a hug amount of lost production time. The economic impact of the introduction of this new technology has been estimated at over 90MECU pre annum. Environmental and social benefits will also arise from the implementation of this new technology. There will be a reduced need for transportation of the rollers to and from a coating site and safety benefits will result from the reduction of the need to remove these large, often contaminated rollers from their production line positions. To achieve these technical and economic objectives a research partnership has been formed comprising industrialists and developers. The consortium contains 6 SMEs, manufacturers, developers and end users, together with large and small research institutes to provide the essential research and development expertise and facilities. The consortium is therefore capable of providing the highest level of research expertise, end user and industrial elements and exploitation capability.",1,1
792,82601,No,Conditional inactivation of Notch signalling during myogenesis by development and application of Pax7 specific transgenic mouse models,"Determination of the complex cause and effect signalling pathways that lead from pluripotent precursor cells to differentiated tissue is a critical topic that impacts on the development of effective stem cell therapies. Notch signalling is important for many cell fate decisions, however for myogenic progenitors clear genetic proof is still required.  Because Notch mutants are embryonic lethal, we aim to develop a conditional inactivation system utilising Cre/lox murine transgenesis. We will introduce Cre recombinase expression under control of native Pax7 control elements as this gene defines the embryonic myogenic lineage and adult muscle satellite cells.  We will also use the Tet-On system to allow temporal control of Cre-mediated recombination. By crossing these Cre-expressing lines with mice carrying floxed alleles of Notch1 and its downstream effector RBPJk, we will be able to inactivate these genes in embryonic myogenic precursors and adult muscle satellite cells.  Whilst this transgenic approach is underway we will also conduct a collaborative in vitro side project whereby protein extract from cultured in vitro myoblasts are affinity captured to identify interactors for a previously identified critical E-box transcriptional binding site located in the Myf5 promoter.  Overall, our transgenic approach will provide the means to determine the role of Notch signalling in myogenic precursor cell development in the embryo and adult.  The Pax7 specific Cre expressing transgenics will also provide a tool that we will be able to apply to other gene targets in myogenesis, which will help resolve the pathways essential to myogenic cell fate determination. Additionally, we will be investigating potential new regulators of Myf5 in vitro.",0,0
722,224296,No,Increasing the scientific excellence and technological innovation capacity in Functional Materials for Medical Devices and Robotics of the University of Tartu,"The aim of the TWINNIMS project is to enhance the scientific and technological capacity of the consortium partners, with a principal focus on the University of Tartu (UTARTU), and to raise its research profile in the field of Functional Materials for Medical Devices and Robotics, in particular in the research application sub-field of minimal invasive and wearable medical robotics, that have a huge potential in terms of solving the global challenges in the quality of life and wellbeing. The internationally leading partners in the project are the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Italy) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8520 (CNRS, France). Resources and competences will be shared and advanced across 3 capacity building focus areas (CBFAs): Bioinspired Soft Robotics, Soft Robotics Materials and Soft Materials Microfabrication Technologies. The activities targeted both to the researchers and early stage researchers (ESRs) strengthen the scientific excellence, technology transfer and innovation capacity (industry-academia collaboration) and skills for research communication and societal acceptance of the applications (social sciences and humanities, SSH involvement). For ESRs the benefits are 4 rounds of mobility (incl. 1 industry traineeship), 1 joint summer school (incl. ESRs-researchers joint session involving SSH), international summer/winter school attendance, joint supervision and mentoring. Activities for researchers include 4 mobility rounds on the CBFAs and technology transfer, 3 from researcher to researcher master classes, 1 virtual training, establishment of an industry-academia network, organization of 3 TWINNIMS annual panel sessions, 1 hackathon (also for ESRs),industry and SSH mentoring, attendance at conferences and trade shows.

536,30929,No,Nanoporous particle track etched membranes -ptm- and their use as templates for electrodeposited multilayers for giant magnetoresistance applications - gmr,"This project has made the bridge between three very different areas of science: the track etching of polymer membranes, electro-deposition chemistry and the physics of GMR.  A) To build on the patented PTM technology of the University of Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium to develop the basic science and control over process parameters to be able to produce nPTMs of well controlled pore size and to explore markets for these materials. B) To fill the nano-pores of these membranes with multi-layers of different metals by electro-deposition such multi-layers exhibiting low and high field GMR effects. C) To measure the GMR properties of these nano-wires, to develop the theory of perpendicular transport and relate this to the experimental results and to assess the potential application of these materials as active substrates for sensors and data storage.  During this Brite EuRam Programme, methods have been developed for achieving control over pore size and shape in nPTMs made of polycarbonate. This means that actually, the technology consisting of: i) a bombardment of a polycarbonate film with energetic heavy ions accelerated by a Cyclotron, ii) pre-treatment and chemical etching which allows the preparation of membranes with nanopores in the range 10 - 100nm with controlled shape and pore density. This technology is subject of a patent application. Also in polycarbonate, and additional to the original goals of the project, the feasibility of patterning the membrane has been demonstrated. This new method, which is also the subject of a patent application, will be further developed within the scope of a new project funded under the Growth Programme of Framework V programme and starting on February 1st, 2000.  The translation of these developments to other polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide and polyvinylidene flouride was less successful and more work is still required in these areas.  The method for making nanoporous poly-carbonate membranes was scaled up and substantial quantities of material has been produced for use in further R & D work and for market application. Some problems are still arising which concern the pore shape and the scaling-up method must be improved in the future. Concerning other polymers, the scaling up has not been envisaged due to the problems encountered during the lab-scale studies.  Concerning the second goal, electro-deposition methods were successfully developed for filling the nano pores with different metals by electro-deposition from appropriate solutions. Single metals such as Au, Ag, Ni, Cu, Co and the alloy NiFe were successfully deposited. Multilayer structures of alternating metals and/or alloys of layers typically 1 - 2nm thick were also successfully produced for high field systems such as Co/Cu, Fe/Cu, Co/Au and Co/Ag and for low field system such as Cu/NiFe.  Early experiments on the possibility of developing a multi-bath technique for certain metallic systems which do not lend themselves for deposition from a solution containing both ions identified numerous technical hurdles and this feasibility task was dropped at the Mid Term Review.  Controlled deposition and lithographic techniques were successfully developed for contacting single nanowires in order to make transport measurements on them to aid the fundamental theoretical work. Excellent agreement was demonstrated between the theoretical models and experimental data. This is now the subject of several publications in leading journals.  The third goal was devoted to GMR applications. GMR measurements and characterisation of a wide variety of systems such as Co/Cu, NiFe/Cu and Fe/Cu has generated a wealth of data and insight whilst the measurement of magnetic properties of single metal nanowires has revealed a reorientation of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy as a function of diameter. This effect is only apparent in nanowires of less than 50nm diameter and is not yet completely understood and will be the subject of further research under a recently funded programme within Framework V.  The prospects for using these systems (i.e. multilayered stacks in nanoporous membranes) in sensors and data storage applications have been assessed. BE95-1761  The demand from industry for ultrapure separations is pushing the technological limits of membrane manufacture. Whilst microporous particle track etched membranes (PTM), with pore sizes in the range 0.1 m (100 nm) to 12 m, are regularly manufactured by Whatman, Europe's only local supplier; existing technology does not permit the controlled manufacture of nanoporous membranes with pore sizes in the range 5-10 nm  The first goal of this project is to build on the patented PTM technology of the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium to develop the basic science and processes for the efficient production of nanoporous PTMs. Although the initial work will be carried out on polycarbonate membranes, the project will also develop know-how for manufacture of nanoporous PTMs in other polymers which will extend their application range. These materials will be sampled to potential customers in the second part of this project.  Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a remarkable property of certain metallic multilayers which are able to detect tiny magnetic fields. GMR has application in magnetic data storage technology and in magnetic sensors and Thomson, France (partner) is a leading company in this field.  Recent work by three of the project partners has shown that multilayered nanowires, produced in nanoporous PTMs, also exhibit perpendicular GMR effects. The combination of nano-geometry and GMR effect has significance for the development of very high density magnetic storage systems. The multilayered nanowires are deposited using electrodeposition technology, this is a low cost, ambient temperature method which will produce robust materials enabling the GMR effect to be exploited in a large range of magnetic sensors and other applications.  The GMR part of this project will develop the basic science and theoretical understanding of these new GMR nanowires, develop processes for the controlled deposition of both 'hard' and 'soft' multilayers and explore the potential for single metal nanowires in magnetic recording.  The consortium comprises a membrane manufacturer (Whatman), a manufacturer of electronic systems and components (Thomson), the Polymer and Solid State Physics departments of the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium (UCL), the magnetic phenomena laboratories of the Universities of Paris Sud and Strasbourg (U. Paris Sud \ U. Louis Pasteur) plus the Industry Microelectronics Center, Sweden (IMC) who brings considerable experience of electrodeposition of metallic multilayers.

893,46651,No,Biotransformations using baeyer-villiger mono-oxygenases,"The objective of the present project is to lay the scientific foundations necessary to achieve eventual commercial exploitation of microbial Baeyer-Villiger mono-oxygenases (BVMOs). This particularly exciting class of enzymes is able to catalyse regio- and stereo-specific oxidations which are difficult to achieve by chemical methods. The enantiomerically pure products are intermediates for the potential manufacture of fine chemicals of high value in the pharmaceutical and food industries. We believe that it is crucial that these very promising biocatalysts are exploited for the benefit of European industry.   The aim of this proposal is to develop a multidisciplinary approach for the production, fundamental study and potential application of these enzymes. This project is timely not only because of the potential values of the products that could be made using BVMOs but also because within Europe we already have world class laboratories working on these enzymes. To capitalise on this expertise it is vital that these laboratories join together in this project, which will bring together skills in organic chemistry, enzymology, molecular biology and genetics, and Xray crystallography with biochemical engineering in an integrated way to demonstrate the feasibility of use of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases on a large-scale and the versatility of these biocatalysts for producing chemicals of industrial interest   This will involve (i) undertaking cloning and expression to increase enzyme synthesis and express the desired enzymes in suitable hosts, (ii) scale up production of microorganisms to pilot scale (25-300L), (iii) characterisation of reactions by evaluating the properties of substrates, products and catalysts and the reaction characteristics and kinetics, (iv) establishing the scope of reactions by exploring the range of substrates that can be converted and characterising the products, (v) investigating the feasibility of effective cofactor recycling in reactions using isolated BVMOs, (vi) developing guidelines for process selection and operation (vii) the synthesis of substrate to make sufficient amounts of products for further processing, and (viii) demonstrating that such products can be converted chemically into compounds with potential commercial value   The involvement of two companies in the project will ensure that work done will be directed towards laying the foundations for achieving the ultimate goal of commercial exploitation of these catalysts to produce valuable chemicals through an efficient, cost-effective and reliable process with minimum environmental impact.",1,0
2,196022,Yes,Nanomaterials Ecological Risk Assessment: A study of the long-term effects and risks of nanoscale Iron Oxide used in plastic composites in the aquatic environment,"The nanoform of Iron Oxide (n-Fe2O3) is a large-volume substance used in pigments. Nanoscale Fe2O3 pigments are used to a significant extent in consumer products such as household appliances made of coloured plastic composites. This application implies high probability of n-Fe2O3 release into the aquatic environment (especially during end-of-life processing of the plastics), where n-Fe2O3 may pose risks to freshwater and sediment organisms. Presently, very little is known about the biological interactions and the ecological risks of n-Fe2O3, as the available information addresses only short-term effects of pristine n-Fe2O3. Therefore, the goal of NanoERA is to develop concepts and methods, and to generate data to predict the long-term ecological effects and risks of n-Fe2O3 (fragments) released from end-of-life processing of a coloured plastic composite into the aquatic environment and to compare them to the pristine n-Fe2O3 used to produce the composite. In order to achieve this, the fellow will analyse how the physicochemical properties of the n-Fe2O3 (fragments) change in environmental (i.e. freshwater and sediment) and biological (cell culture) media and how these changes affect the biological interactions of these materials in aquatic organisms. The generated ecotoxicological effects data will be used to derive dose-response relationships and to quantitatively estimate the long-term ecological risks of the n-Fe2O3 (fragments).  In the process of achieving the NanoERA scientific objectives the Marie Curie fellow will obtain training in transferable and technical skills. The fellow’s qualification match very well to the research programme, which promises that NanoERA will produce excellent scientific results, which will be broadly disseminated to achieve significant and long-lasting impact on the European objectives for safe and responsible nanoinnovation.",0,1
267,215304,No,Modeling critical reliability issues in VLSI technologies beyond 2020,"This proposal presents an interdisciplinary, forward looking, training-by-research plan in the field of physical reliability modeling of emerging transistors and materials beyond 2020. Its main goal is development and validation of a simulation framework which self-consistently considers the main reliability phenomena including bias temperature instability, hot-carrier degradation, and self-heating. These effects were suggested to be the response of interface and oxide defects/precursors which can be activated by different driving forces determined by device operating conditions and specifics of the device topology. Thus, the core of this project will be put on a detailed microscopic description of the properties of defects/precursors, which will be studied experimentally and theoretically. Within this defect-centric paradigm we will address reliability issues in devices with emerging architectures, i.e. fin and nanowire transistors, high-k gate dielectrics, and high mobility channel materials such as SiGe, Ge, and III-V alloys. The unifying model building on the microscopic defect properties will be validated over a wide range of device bias conditions. We will capture the parasitic effect of self-heating which has a strong impact on the energetic distribution of hot carriers and hence on hot-carrier degradation. Special attention will be paid to time-dependent variability of device characteristics which is a response of nanoscale devices on activation/deactivation of individual defects.  Knowledge acquired within this project will be valuable for applied and fundamental physics, material science, computational chemistry, electrical engineering, VLSI technology, and circuit design. The research and training activities will enhance applicant’s future career by broadening his professional skills and expertise, expose him to industrial requirements, and open new perspectives for future collaboration with industry.",0,0
888,211878,No,New nanomaterials for neural stem cells drug delivery,"Brain conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and traumatic injuries are a mayor burden in modern society. Because neural stem cells (NSCs) can differentiate into new neural cells including neurons, the regulation of their proliferation, differentiation and migration represent a promising regenerative/therapeutic strategy. The hypothesis of NanoStem project is that novel nanoparticles (NPs) combined with recent identified/developed pharmaceuticals can be an efficient approach to control the biological activity of NSCs. The scientific project is organized in three work packages (WP), each focusing on specific objectives and containing well-defined deliverables. WP1 will focus on the synthesis of the nanomaterials and the uploading of the therapeutics. WP2 will take the best nanoparticles and focus more on the evaluation of the permeation and efficacy of the formulations against NSCs. WP3 will focus on in vivo studies to evaluate the formulations developed to tackle the brain and to assess their toxicity. The project will train 14 ESRs in areas including organic and polymer chemistry, cell biology, pharmacology, neuroscience, nanobiotechnology and clinical sciences. The project will also provide a substantial training program in complementary skills, targeting both professional and personal development, and translation of research and entrepreneurship. The project brings together six academic partners, one hospital and two industrial teams as full partners, complemented by four associate partners, one of which is an industrial team, distributed over a total of seven European Union member states.

964,46065,No,Optimisation of retroviral vectors for gene transfer to human pluripotenthematopoietic cells and application to chronic granulomatous disease,"Research objectives and content  Somatic gene therapy constitute an alternative strategy to Bone Marrow Transplantation in order to cure primary immunodeficiencies, such as Chronic Granulomatous Disease. The optimal target cell population for such a strategy is the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, which is defined by the capacity for extensive self-renewal, retention of multilineage differentiation potential and long term reconstitution of entire haematopoietic system. Nevertheless successes in mouse model, retroviral-mediated gene transfer into a significant proportion of human hematopoietic repopulating cells using vectors based on the Moloney murine leukemia remains inefficient.  To overcome some of these problems, different pseudotyped retroviral vectors, such as the feline endogenous virus | or the gibbon ape leukemia virus, will be tested to transduce human stem cell from cord blood and bone marrow | cells. The ability to efficiently transduce these cells will be tested using an in vivo functional assay for primitive . human hematopoietic cells based on their ability to repopulate bone marrow of immunodeficient nonobese . diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice..  Because defect genes, such as P47phox, implicated in Chronic Granulomatous Disease are expressed in myeloid . cells, the second objective is to achieve optimal expression of the transgene in the mature myeloid cells. We will test optimised retroviral regulatory sequences to achieve this goal. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)   .

596,11507,No,DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT HYDROCARBON GAS LITHOGEOCHEMISTRY AND ITS RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT STYLES OF MINERALIZATION,"THIS PROJECT SHOULD ESTABLISH THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THE USE OF LIGHT HYDROCARBONS LITHOGEOCHEMISTRY FOR A WIDE RANGE OF MINERAL DEPOSIT.  A new lithogeochemical exploration tool has been developed for use in the exploitation of hidden base metal deposits. The new method involves the uses chromatographic analysis of volatile organic compounds released by rocks.  The discovery of anomalously high amounts of methane in rocks adjacent to mineralization in the Northern Pennines Orefield led to the examination of a new lithogeochemical exploration tool for hidden based metal deposits. The method, based on the chromatographic analysis of the volatile organic compounds released by heating the rocks in sealed tubes was first tested on the site of the initial findings and later on deposits in Ireland and in other European countries.  Observations concerning the heat extraction process strongly supported the idea that volatile compounds can be strongly held in rocks, under the sorbed state. A comparison of the results provided by various techniques revealed that heating is the most appropriate way to release them effectively. Sorption is also the only process which permits the compounds to remain in the rocks for long periods of time, and also allows them sufficient mobility to migrate form concealed orebodies.  The analytical results were not as precise as expected, giving the conclusion that there is inherent variation in 1 to 4 mm rock fractions which cannot be easily reduced. This is consistent with the irregular distribution of organic matter, which is thought to provide the majority of hydrocarbon sorption sites.  Field studies demonstrated variations in gas signatures in response to mineralizing events, leading to the possibility of detecting corresponding variations in surface rocks. In Liassic sediments of low thermal maturity, higher trace metal levels tended to be associated with increasing proportions of methane. In addition, organic geochemical studies suggested new genetic hypotheses, supplementing or contradicting previous interpretations. Studies in Carboniferous areas of very high thermal maturity, also pointed to a strong correlation between some hydrocabon species (propyne) and mineralization, be it with known mineral deposits, or with trace metal anomalies, or both. There was no obvious hydrocarbon response to the predominantly vein type mineralization in the Carboniferous rocks of Belgium and the United Kingdom. This difference in response is thought to be a function of deposit size, and could have considerable exploration significance. SAMPLES WILL BE COLLECTED FROM THE LOWER CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONES OF IRELAND AND THE UK, THE VESDRE BASIN IN BELGIUM, FROM THE MINE AREAS OF LES MALINES AND CHESSY IN FRANCE, MEGGEN IN GERMANY, ALMADEN AND CARTAGENA IN SPAIN. LABORATORY STUDIES WILL INCLUDE:   1) DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEAT EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE, TO IMPROVE ANALYTICAL PRECISION;  2) DETAILED TESTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE ORIGINS OF ANOMALIES AND ON HOW THE GASES ARE HELD IN ROCKS.

366,199163,No,EasyFlow: New asthma monitor to enable the effective control of asthma,"Asthma affects the quality of life of millions of sufferers globally and causes a huge economic burden each year; asthma treatment is estimated to cost €17.7bn and the cost of lost productivity €9.8bn. It is estimated that in Europe there are 30 million asthma sufferers and 15,000 will die each year from an asthma attack even though the drugs used to treat asthma are safe, effective and if used correctly, would prevent many of these deaths. Asthma attacks result from ineffective monitoring leading to inadequate doses of prescribed drugs and therefore poor control of symptoms. Monitoring is vital as asthmatics will often not notice a gradual worsening of symptoms and will not adjust their medication accordingly potentially leading to a severe attack. Peak flow meters are currently used by asthmatics to monitor symptoms on a regular basis but compliance is poor as they are difficult to use, particularly in the young or old, and the technique required can cause exacerbation of symptoms plus the output then requires interpretation. We have developed a prototype of our easy to use home monitoring device that uses normal tidal breathing to generate breath profiles that change as symptoms deteriorate. The device incorporates our patented sensor housed in the mouth piece, which captures the breath profiles, attached to a handheld screen to display the interpretation of the breath profiles using an easy to understand traffic light system. Patients can then easily see whether they need to increase their asthma medication to control their symptoms and avoid an asthma attack.

607,194575,No,Negotiating early job-insecurity and labour market exclusion in Europe,"Through an innovative use of four key concepts (resilience, capability, active agency and negotiation) and primary data (life course interviews, vignette experiments), NEGOTIATE will deliver gender-sensitive comparative knowledge about consequences of early job insecurity. We move beyond the state-of-the-art by investigating the linkages across macro, meso and micro levels as mechanisms of early job insecurity. General labour market processes and a severe employment crisis currently define the macro level. The micro level is characterised by young people with unequal opportunities to influence individual job prospects. The organisation of meso level structures creates differential access to public and private support within and across countries. NEGOTIATE’s core question is how young people’s scope for agency interacts with different layers of structural conditions in a multi-level governance system. By actively involving national and European stakeholders – including young people – NEGOTIATE will contribute to policies that promote the employability of young Europeans, thus maximising societal and scientific impact. We will observe the present, learn from the past and project the future to inform policies that help prevent early labour market exclusion and adverse effects of job insecurity in the short and long term, thereby leading Europe closer to the Europe 2020 goals. A trans-disciplinary Consortium of nine research institutions – from BG, CZ, DE, EL, NO, PL, ES, CH, UK – and one international CSO will implement NEGOTIATE. The participating countries are differently affected by the economic crisis and display historical variations across key institutional factors, such as welfare state arrangements, employment relations and youth transition regimes. The participation of SOLIDAR will strengthen NEGOTIATE’s policy impact. Overall, the participants’ wide set of research skills enable a rich combination of advanced quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses.",0,0
973,227033,No,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring with Smartphone-integrated Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is an essential tool for measuring the circulating concentration of specific narrow therapeutic drugs at designated intervals, in order to maximise the efficacy of the drug and avoid toxicity and adverse drug reactions. TDM is currently available only in central laboratories or large hospitals, and several barriers prevent its wide implementation in routine clinical practice. First, current technologies used for TDM (e.g. high-performance liquid chromatography – HPLC, mass spectrometry – MS) are exclusively used in central laboratories due to their cost, system size and weight, complexity of use and maintenance requirements. Second, alternative technologies (e.g. ELISA immunoassays) are analyte-specific and do not allow adaptability to new analytes (increasing costs). We verified the feasibility and clinical utility of using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) for TDM using real plasma samples taken from de-identified patients. Importantly, our measurements were consistent with state-of-the-art data generated by LC-MS/MS. We already have experimentally shown a 0.1 μM detection limit on pure, artificial samples. Within THERA, we aim to transform our research output into a commercially-relevant (in terms of size, throughput, user friendliness and cost) product by creating a minimum viable product that will enable TDM for a wide variety of molecules. Our goal within this project is to validate this device on clinical samples and build a strong business case for it that will enable commercial exploitation. THERA will advance our SERS-based device from a current technology readiness level of 3 to 5/6. Our value proposition is a tabletop, miniaturized (smartphone-sized) device that can perform TDM on a single droplet of blood, in a matter of minutes, without the need for specialized personnel, at a fraction of the cost currently associated with TDM.",0,0
576,100340,No,How does the X chromosome regulate DNA methylation in pluripotent stem cells?,"Epigenetic processes regulate gene transcription states during cellular differentiation, playing key roles in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation. Epigenetic alterations are common in diseases such as in cancer and cognitive disorders. Understanding the mechanisms by which epigenetic states are inherited and propagated is of fundamental importance, and will help in the development of biomarkers for screening as well identification of targets for disease treatment. DNA methylation remains the best-characterized epigenetic process. XX pluripotent stem cells (Embryonic Stem (ES) and induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells) display genome-wide hypomethylation relative to XY stem cells but the mechanisms are unknown. This proposal will elucidate the pathways responsible. Irradiation Microcell-Mediated Chromosome Transfer (XMMCT) will be used to identify the critical region(s) of the X chromosome involved. In parallel and as an alternative approach, candidate X-linked genes will be over-expressed in XY ES cells to identify the factors responsible for global hypomethylation. Further insight will be provided using protein interaction screens using epitope-tagged versions of all active Dnmts as well as the known regulators URHF1 and Dnmt3L in XX and XY ES cells. The role of XX-induced hypomethylation in cellular reprogramming will be investigated by using different cell types from Oct4-GFP transgenic mice to examine whether iPS efficiency is affected by cells with a greater propensity to lose DNA methylation. Together these aims will elucidate the signals necessary to maintain global genomic DNA methylation. Aberrant loss is an important hallmark and contributor of disease that could be used for disease diagnosis and treatment. It could also be exploited to help improve the efficiency of cellular reprogramming for regenerative medicine.",0,0
610,92610,No,Biophysical principles of cellular morphogenesis,"Living cells are endowed with structure and mechanical stability by an intricate elastic network of protein filaments known as the cytoskeleton. These filaments are stiff on the scale of the cell and thus readily deform the cell membrane, while simultaneously being affected configurationally by spatial confinement. The coupled morphogenesis of cytoskeleton and membrane ultimately appears as dynamic rearrangements that drive physiological processes such as cell migration or division. I strive to unravel biophysical principles of cell morphogenesis. To this end, I propose to construct biomimetic cell models by confining actin biopolymer gels to cell-sized lipid vesicles mimicking cellular confinement. I will systematically investigate the interplay between entropy-driven organization, and that induced by cross-linker proteins which connect actin filaments, or motor proteins which actively slide them. A key innovation lies in the bottom-up approach of gradually increasing system complexity to eventually achieve a model which is far more realistic than existing assays. The system permits quantitative measurements of network and membrane shape (using fluorescence microscopy) and of local and global mechanical properties as well as active driving (using innovative particle tracking microrheology). This will allow me testing and development of new theoretical models. The proposed project promises to significantly advance our understanding of how cells orchestrate their shape and movements, and to foster novel medical treatments of diseases related to malfunctions of the cytoskeleton. Simultaneously, it addresses exciting physical questions raised by the unusual properties of cells, such as self-organization of non-equilibrium soft matter and material properties of polymer-membrane composites. If we can identify physical design principles of cells we can eventually harness these to create novel functional and smart materials based on bio(-inspired) molecules.",0,0
386,188264,No,Polymer Optical Sensing System Innovation Benefits Leadership Education,"Project POSSIBLE seeks to draw on recent developments in optical fibre sensors to tackle two important industrial sensing problems: the provision of an all optical fuel gauging system for aircraft and the development of simple, highly sensitive acoustic and vibration sensors for geophysical surveying and surveillance. Importantly, the project will form an excellent stage on which to prepare the Marie Curie Fellow for a future academic career involving innovation in collaboration with industrial partners. Key to the research is the developing maturity of fibre Bragg grating strain sensors recorded in polymer optical fibres, rather than the more established silica fibre. The much lower elastic modulus of polymers means that the sensors are much more sensitive to stress than their silica counterparts and therefore can offer enhanced sensitivity in certain applications, such as those targeted in this project. The project brings together an early stage researcher who already possesses significant expertise with silica fibre sensors as well as some experience of the polymer devices, with the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies who are by several measures world leaders in polymer grating fabrication and applications development.",0,0
438,3896,No,COORDINATION RESEARCH ON IMMUNOGENETICS OF AIDS,"The aim of this Concerted Action was to clarify whether immunogenetic markers of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of man, the HLA system, controls the susceptibility to become infected with HIV and/or the susceptibility to develop AIDS when infected. The coordinated research programme is to investigate whether there is a genetic predisposition to become infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) upon exposure to and/or to develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) once infected with HIV. 14 different groups from 12 different countries participate in this collaboration. 13 different groups from 12 European countries human leucocyte antigen (HLA ) typed and provided HLA data on 8614 unrelated controls and HLA and clinical data on 1581 unrelated patients including 1246 HIV infected ones. No differences in HLA marker frequencies were observed between 127 HIV positive and 148 HIV negative haemophiliacs indicating that the HLA system does probably not control infectability in this group of patients. In other groups, there was some evidence that the susceptibility to become infected with HIV might be partly controlled by the HLA system. There was better evidence that HLA factors may influence the course of the HIV infection because significantly more antigens than should be expected showed significant differences in the frequencies when comparing patients with symptomatic HIV infection with patients without symptoms. Moreover, when comparing 114 patients classified as fast progressors with 145 classified as slow progressors, the HLA-B35 antigen was significantly associated with fast progression. Apart from the HIV studies, this investigation also provided evidence against a previously claimed association between haemophilia and HLA-DR5.  The major goal of this CA was to clarify whether there are immunogenetic markers associated with a predisposition for HIV-infection and/or the subsequent development of AIDS. In order to answer this question, it was felt that various well-characterized cohorts from different homogeneous European populations together with ethnically matched controls were well suited for study, and the HLA system was considered the best candidate as a marker system because it has been shown to control the susceptibility to a variety of other diseases. Moreover, the HLA system is the most polymorphic genetic system with known function in man. The newly developed DNA-technology allowed definition of new markers not recognizable with conventional methods, but the distribution of these markers in the population had to be established. Moreover, training of staff in these new methods and some degree of standardization was required. To solve these problems, collaboration between a number of groups within the EEC and COST countries was required, which thus became one of the objectives of the study.",0,0
594,99055,No,"The subnuclear relocation of promoters during development, and following stress induction in C. elegans","During development and cellular differentiation, cells acquire specific fates by regulating spatially and temporally the expression of certain groups of genes. This correlates with drastic changes in the 3D organization of the genome. A recent discovery from the Gasser lab has demonstrated that in differentiated cells of C. elegans, tissue-specific promoters relocate inward the 3D nuclear space when activated, and maintain this subnuclear position in a tissue-specific manner into adulthood. Another interesting finding is the relocation of heat-shock promoters toward the nuclear periphery after their induction. Altogether, the data strongly suggests a link between the subnuclear relocation of specific promoters and cellular processes. However, the exact purpose of these chromatin movements is unclear and so is the underlying mechanism, including the responsible components. Therefore, this project aims to understand the mechanism and function of the subnuclear relocation of promoters during development, and following stress induction in C. elegans. This proposal will focus first on the identification of molecular and genetic elements that may be involved in this mechanism. Second, we want to understand how the candidate components we will identify effect the subnuclear promoters' relocation, and understand for the first time the relevance of this kind of chromatin reorganization. We combine genetic manipulations, advanced biochemical methods that we will need to develop and quantitative live imaging approaches to address these questions. The work is proposed to be carried out under supervision of Prof. Susan Gasser, at the FMI institute which offers state-of-the-art facilities and provides excellent multi-disciplinary training and collaboration opportunities, thus providing the ideal environment for a successful postdoctoral stay. This postdoc experience will mean switching fields and countries which will play an essential role in my professional growth.",0,0
84,213619,Yes,A Key Enabling Technology for metals recovery and water management based on functionalized magnetic particles for galvanic industry,"Surface Treatment of metals (e.g. galvanization) involves a lot of washing, rinsing and batch dumps steps, which generate a huge amount of wastewater, containing soluble forms of the various metals used in the treatment (Zn, Ni, Cr). After the chemical-physical treatment of waste waters based on precipitation, a relevant amount of sludge, containing metal oxides, which need to be disposed as hazardous waste at a cost of about 1500 Euro/ton. Captive Systems has developed and patented a technology for producing amphiphilic magnetic nanoparticles, which are soluble in water, and can be used as “Magnetic Fluids” (MF) for the capture, removal and recovery of metal ions from wastewaters and in a single step, by simply using a mixing and magnetic trap. This allows to reduce by 90% the production of sludge as hazardous waste and to recover the metals, in a simple and cheap solution: estimated reduction of cost for waste water treatment and sludge disposal is > 70%. The technology has been tested at pilot scale in the galvanic industry, in collaboration with the industrial partners involved in the company: a galvanic industry, a producer of consumables for the galvanic industry and a company specialized in the waste treatment.  Once scaled up and demonstrated at industrial level, MF can become a BAT for the waste water treatment in the galvanic industry. The market entry is targeted selling the plants and the consumables in JV with the industrial partners; however to expand in the market a “turnkey service model” is targeted to minimize the cost for the end user, typically SMEs. In the feasibility study Captive needs to carry out: 1) Customer Validation for the market price target verification, 2) Profiling industrial partners and investors to pave the way to agreements signature for the scale up of the industrial production and the launch of the turnkey service business model; 3) Refining the Business Plan and the Investment strategy.",1,1
677,214063,No,Advanced Biomass Catalytic Conversion to Middle Distillates in Molten Salts,"ABC-SALT will validate at lab scale a novel route to produce sustainable liquid biofuels (middle distillates (MD)) from various lignocellulosic waste streams for the transport industry, both on roads (biodiesel) and in air (jet fuel), targeting a yield over 35 wt% in the middle distillate range, based on the biomass dry input, and a carbon yield of 55 %. ABC-SALT will solve the following technical challenges: liquefaction and subsequent catalytic hydro-pyrolysis of the biomass in a molten salt environment, followed by the catalytic hydro-deoxygenation of the vapour phase using suitable catalysts to obtain a hydrocarbon product suitable for use as a MD biofuel. ABC-SALT will then operate an integrated lab scale reactor during over 100 hours to provide lab-scale validation of the whole process, bringing this technology to TRL 4. The project includes technical aspects (such as substrate flexibility, biomass liquefaction and hydro-pyrolysis in molten salts and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation and their integration), but also a socio- and techno-economic viability study of the technology (substrate availability and supply chain, future end-users and economic sustainability of the process). This will ensure the future deployment of this new technology considering its social related issues, such as acceptance or modification of the perception of transport induced by such sustainable fuels. Such a holistic approach considering the full value chain, combined to communication with stakeholders during the course of the project, will provide valuable input for scale up and industry-oriented research after this project, maximizing the impact, amongst other in the biomass, biofuel and transport industry. To reach its objectives, the project covers the whole value chain, from feedstock supplier to end-users (knowledge users (RUG, UG, AU, NMBU, DLR), technology users (BTG, Innventia), and middle distillates users (through DLR)), as well as an entity dedicated to SSH aspects (CIRPA).",1,0
911,38221,No,Novel human renal and hepatic co-culture in-vitro test systems for the evaluation of biotechnology derived cytokines,"The development of recombinant human proteins including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and growth factors by the Biotechnology Industry is restricted because of the unsuitability of animal-based in-vitro and in-vivo test systems due to cross-species problems in detecting immuno-pharmaco-toxicology of these products.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop in-vitro tests with human cells to evaluate the immuno-pharmacotoxicological properties of biotechnology-derived cytokines. Specifically, the aims include development of human kidney and liver in-vitro models that will more closely mimic the in-vivo situation. For liver and kidney advanced cell culture methodology is available and both organs have been shown to be prominent targets of toxic biotechnology derived products. There is a need to have models with similar tissue level of cellular organization allowing cell-cell networking and communication. This will be achieved by having cell co-culture systems maintained on microporous substrates under perifusion conditions which allows constant nutrient supply. Recent studies from our laboratories and other groups indicate that primary cells maintained under these conditions have significantly improved maintenance of differentiated functions. In addition, we will exploit our recent findings that renal structural cells (epithelial, endothelial and mesangial) are immunologically active cells. The novel aspects of this proposal include: 1. the exclusive use of human renal and liver cells in a perifusion co-culture system.  2. the development of molecular markers of renal and hepatic cellular response to cytokines leading to novel in-vitro tests.  3. the eventual replacement of primary human cells with human cell lines for in-vitro test systems more adaptable for use by the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry.  Specific Measurable Objectives are:  1. co-culture of human glomerular mesangial cells and glomerular endothelial cells under perifusion conditions as a model of the renal glomerulus. 2. co-culture of human renal proximal tubular cells and renal microvascular endothelial cells under perifusion conditions as a model of the renal proximal tubule.  3. co-culture of human hepatocytes and Kupffer cells under perifusion conditions as a model of the liver.  4. establishing the effects of therapeutic cytokines on these primary human cell models using ECVAM recommended end-points and novel molecular markers. 5. simplification of the test systems, for example, through the use of selected cell lines, to make it suitable for use by the pharmaceutical industry.  These relate directly to the priorities addressed under area 7.1 of the Bioteclmology 1994-1998 Workprogramme; specifically they comply with 7.1.3. In vitro tests for immuno-pharmaco-toxicology - especially in-vitro tests to evaluate the pharmaco/toxicological properties of biotechnology-derived substances; and 7.1.4 cell cultures for the development of in-vitro tests. To achieve the objectives a trans-European multi-disciplinary collaboration involving academic (Innsbruck, Dublin, Bath, Rouen and Konstanz) and industrial partners (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Belgium; SME-Biotrin - diagnostics, Ireland and SME-Tyrol Tools, Austria - plastic mouldings) with proven expertise in EU projects and in developing and marketing products is required.

945,80619,No,Novel Magneto-Optical Biosensors for Malaria Diagnosis,"The objective of this proposal is to develop new, fast and effective instrumentation for the diagnosis of malaria by a non-invasive methodology that permits the precise in-vivo analysis of certain specific blood characteristics. It is prompted by the devastating effects of malaria on health and national economies in the third world, the threat to southern European states following climate change. The malarial parasite is known to modify the magnetic properties of red blood in proportion to the degree of infection through conversion of haemoglobin to haemozoin thus changing the magnetic properties.  This proposal will investigate these changed magnetisation states using both the magneto-optical and magneto-thermal interactions of blood as a basis for a potential bio-sensing system for malaria. Currently the most common method of diagnosing malaria is by observation of infected blood using microscopy by trained microscopists. This is time consuming and cannot be accomplished in the field.  The project objectives are two prototype instruments: 1) A portable instrument based on electronic measurement of the magneto-optic response of a blood sample. 2) A completely non-invasive instrument requiring no blood sample and hence avoiding potential cross-infection and HIV issues.  This project will attempt to break new ground in the field of medical diagnosis using magneto-optics and photonics to access information from biological samples that can therefore be interrogated electronically and potentially non-invasively. The use of these techniques is not confined to malaria diagnosis, having wider application for longer-term development in providing a means of interrogating the condition of biological samples where diseased states (cancerous tissues, leukaemia, diabetes) can be identified from fluctuations in magneto-optical or thermal behaviour.

These teeth dominate a fossil record that is among the richest and most complete. To date, this record has been exploited successfully but solely for its biostratigraphic significance; the evolutionary significance of lineages, reconstructed through biostratigraphy, has not been realised because the tooth function of conodont elements has been determined only very recently. It is my aim to draw together these two strands of research, using state of the art methods of synchrotron radiation x-ray tomographic microscopy to uncover the ontogeny of occlusal elements and derive digital models using computed tomography that will be subject to virtual occlusal modelling to inform loads in FE Analyses of element function. Predictions from FEA will be tested using microwear and mesowear analyses characterised using optical profilometry, and through EBSD analysis of element microstructure. This seminal study will revolutionise both our understanding of the conodont fossil record – the role of intrinsic innovation versus extrinsic forces of competition and environmental change, it will also establish an entirely new suite of investigative tools to the discipline. The study will also demonstrate the importance of biostratigraphic and taxonomic data and how it is possible to integrate traditional and state of the art approaches in a world-class research programme.

Thus, there is an urgent need to further understand the various processes that determine the occurence of metabolic alterations, predominantly obesity and T2D and to develop strategies to provide therapeutic aid. Several intrinsic factors either predetermine or correlate with the occurence of obesity and the development of T2D and MS. Our laboratory has recently reported a yet unidentified role of the mammalian oxygen sensor PHD1 in the control of glucose homeostasis by phenotyping PHD1 knockout mice. In detail, loss of PHD1 lowers oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle by shifting glucose metabolism from oxidative to more anaerobic ATP production which impairs oxidative muscle performance in healthy conditions, but induces hypoxia tolerance and protects myofibers against lethal ischemia. In addition, novel findings suggest a correlation between PHD1 and intrinsic obesity and T2D related factors. To extend our studies on PHD specific metabolic alterations we will utilize several in the lab made transgenic PHD mice to address the followong issues (i) assess obesity and T2D related changes in lipid and glucose homeostasis in mice lacking each of the PHDs either constitutively or specifically in key metabolic tissues by comparing various metabolic parameters before and after administration of a high fat diet (ii) determine the consequences of loss of PHD function in pancreatic ß-cell physiology, insulin signalling and glucose tolerance using a mouse model of dietary induced diabetes and (iii) determine whether loss of PHD function might have any potential for pharmaceutical intervention by intercrossing our PHD deficient mouse strains with well established mouse models to study obesity and obesity related disorders such as T2D and MS.",0,0

Two main physical processes are due to the interplay of these fundamental forces of nature, and are therefore the focus of this proposal: lepton (electron, neutrino) scattering by atomic nuclei, and nuclear beta decays. Advanced theoretical methods will be used to obtain the structure of the strongly bound systems under study, based on a deformed mean field with residual interactions. The fundamental tenets of the electroweak theory will be applied to the study of lepton scattering and binding by nuclei, as well as to simple and double beta decays, including the neutrinoless mode in the latter case. All these processes have deep implications on hot topics in modern physics, ranging from Particle Physics (neutrino nature, standard model tests, nucleon structure) to Nuclear Physics (neutron distribution, deformation, beta decays), including Astrophysics (stellar nucleosynthesis, structure of neutron stars), Cosmology (neutrino masses and dark matter candidates) and Applied Physics (nuclear medicine, environmental and geophysical issues, nuclear reactors decay heat, etc.). Great experimental effort on the human and on the economic sides is currently being made on these fields (CERN, FAIR, GSI, ...) and therefore reliable theoretical guides as the ones proposed here are a must.

To date, over 60% of drugs employed to target cancer are natural product derived or inspired and this places significant importance on research into the total synthesis of natural products. It also supports the need for the “next generation” of researchers to receive training in this area in order to enable the EU to remain globally competitive. The lycorine family of natural products have shown promise for the development of novel drugs; however a full study requires general access to these alkaloids. We propose a research project to develop methodology for the first syntheses of these complex natural products and novel derivatives, in order to enable future biological testing. For an efficient synthesis of these compounds, we envisage the development of a novel tandem RCM sequence, which can afford, in a single event, a decorated tetrahydroindole skeleton bearing an enol ether, which is crucial to the post-functionalisation of the bicycle. This methodology would allow a straightforward and selective synthesis of numerous lycorine alkaloids not synthesised to date.

SUMMARY  In the 3 million people of Uruguay, serological surveys suggest the existence of 50.000 infected persons with about 1 million living in the endemic areas and at risk to infection. The parasite is found in the domestic cycle, transmitted bY T.infestans, and also in sylvatic conditions, transmitted by T.rubrovaria. Indirect arguments exist indicating the possible infection of humans by sylvatic strains of T. cruzi.In spite of an efficient national control programme, treated areas are regularly reinfested, mainly by T.infestans, but also by T.rubrovaria. Innorthern Uruguay areas where the domiciliary vector population was reduced by control measures, the traditionally sylvatic T.rubrovaria is substituting T.infestans in the domestic habitat. In other areas of Uruguay, T. rubrovaria is living in the peridomestic structures nearby the intradomiciliary T.infestans. To check hazards of reinfestations of domestic habitats by Chagas sylvatic cycles, three main activities will be developed requiring cooperation between different Faculties and Departments of the University of Uruguay, and the technical expertise of different European laboratories.  1. Using different genetic markers, reinfestation problems will be approached by the measure of the dispersal capacity of each vector (gene flow between local populations).  2.The vectorial importance of T. rubrovaria to man is not known, but it is generally found infected by T. cruzi at a higher rate than T. infestans. Using xenodiagnosis, the vector/parasite adaptation will be compared between T.infestans and T.rubrovaria.  3. Lack of identification data about different strains of the parasite make it impossible to know the actual amount of overlapping between the sylvatic and the domestic cycles. Using isoenzymes and the recently developed KDNA probes, we will identify local strains of Trypanosoma cruzi from Sylvatic and domestic vectors.",0,0

132,97549,Yes,Advanced Technologies for the Production of Cement and Clean Aggregates from Construction and Demolition Waste,"The recycling of end-of-life concrete into new concrete is one of the most interesting options for reducing worldwide natural resources use and emissions associated with the building materials sector. The production of the cement used in concrete, for example, is responsible for at least 5% of worldwide CO2 emissions. On-site reuse of clean silica aggregate from old concrete saves natural resources and reduces transport and dust, while the re-use of the calcium-rich cement paste has the potential to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the production of new cement by a factor of two. In order to achieve this goal, a new system approach is studied in which automatic quality control assesses and maintains high standards of concrete demolition waste from the earliest stage of recycling, and novel breaker/sorting technology concentrates silica and calcium effectively into separate fractions at low cost (Figure 1.1). Finally, the smaller calcium-rich fraction, which is typically also rich in fine organic residues, is converted into new binding agents by thermal processing, and mixed with the aggregate into new mortar. Next to technological advances, certification and design guidelines are developed to use the recycle concrete in a responsible and optimal way. The project aims to develop three innovative technologies for recycling end-of-life concrete, integrate them with state-of-the-art demolition and building processes and procedures, and test the new system approach on two Dutch concrete towers involving 70,000 tons of concrete. A special feature of this large case study is a new type of government contract which links the recycling of the towers to the re-use of the recycled materials in new buildings. The results of the project will be used to determine which kinds of strategies and policies are most effective to facilitate an efficient transition towards optimal value recovery from Construction and Demolition Waste and sustainable building.",1,1
746,92277,No,Small Wind Turbine Composite Blade PRoperties ON Demand by Means of Functionally Graded Materials,"The use of renewable energy sources in Europe will increase, leading to more sustainable energy mix and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Wind has been the world's fastest growing renewable energy source for the last seven years, and this trend is expected to continue with falling costs of wind energy. Small wind systems can produce electricity cheaper than the grid and payback their embedded carbon within months. Today Europe has literally millions of homes and businesses waiting to benefit from the effective deployment of this technology.  The main goal of this project is to investigate coupled mechanical and aero-dynamic properties the self-adaptive blade of small wind turbine made of functionally graded composite materials.A combination of non-destructive experimental and numerical simulation methods will be employed. Both structural and wind tunnel test results will be used in two ways: to derive knowledge of a structural and aerodynamic properties of a structure and to update the Finite Element and Computational Fluid Dynamic coupled in Fluid-Structure Interaction approach according to values obtained from tests. This information will be used to introduce the blade self adapting concept into the internal architecture design by means of functionally graded materials. An optimization techniques for numerical models parts will be applied in the pursuit of maximum structural efficiency, maximum performance of the turbine and a low cost of the unit. Such a combination demands to take advantage of knowledge from several fields: structural identification, fluid mechanics, composite materials, measurement methods, signal processing, numerical modeling, model updating, optimization, statistics. As a result of this project the optimized design and prototype of the self adaptive blade of small wind turbine will be delivered. Also a set of updated numerical models will be developed.",1,0

Output Indicators and Impact  The focus is on the development of chemical separations and determinations of (low-level) radio nuclides in environmental and food matrices for which substantial know-how has been accumulated and on (non-nuclear) trace analysis of elements (like heavy metals) in the frame of certification of CRMs and PTMs for which a substantial in-house capacity is needed (service for Reference Materials Unit at IRMM).Analytical support in the frame of the certification, homogeneity and stability control of CRMs is expanding. For reference measurements of radionuclides, the development and application of high performance analytical methods aiming to support the protection of workers and the citizen (e.g. Ra in ground and drinking water, Th in work place materials) will be continued. Summary of the project  High performance and reliable reference methods and analytical measurement procedures are indispensable for the execution of Commission policies on normalisation and standardisation. In summary this project entails: - Developing analytical methods to very high standards and to adapt chemical measurement procedures to the specific requirements imposed by the implementation of directives and the needs in monitoring of EU policies as well as the characterisation of reference materials; - Establishing, improving and validating a pool of complementary analytical techniques for trace element analysis and radio nuclide determination in all kinds of sample matrices, for speciation of chemical elements and for analysis of organic micro-constituents in various matrices.  Rationale: Reference analytical measurements are required to ensure a harmonisation and equivalence of chemical data in many areas, like securing industrial standards, food and environmental quality, health at the work place ¡V to name but a few. With globalisation, EU enlargement and an increased importance attached to world trade issues, more scientific reference methods are needed to enact EU policies and provide hands-on scientific support towards EU harmonisation and interaction with the EU's trading partners, particularly future Member States.",0,0

It will be achieved by coordinated field-, laboratory- and modelling investigations of reactive   halogen species, their precursor and storage species, and the reaction mechanisms involved. Field measurements   will include direct determination of halogen oxides by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS)   at sub-ppt levels. The laboratory studies will close many gaps in our knowledge of RHS related homogeneous   and surface-catalysed reactions including iodine chemistry. The latest data from field and laboratory studies will   be assembled in trajectory- and limited area 3D models, which will help to understand the results of the field   campaigns as well as to assess the regional and global impact of RHS chemistry. A further important part of   this study will be the assessment of a possibly anthropogenic influence on RHS sources and the transformation   mechanisms within the RHS reservoir. Thus possible mechanisms changing the tropospheric oxidation capacity   due to human activities can be investigated. While a central question concerns the importance of release of RHS   from sea salt aerosol, for instance due to reaction of anthropogenic NOy species (like N205, NO2) with sea salt   aerosol, the detailed investigation of those processes is the aim of a parallel study with the sub-title 'Sea Salt   Aerosols: Laboratory Investigation of Heterogeneous Halogen Activation in the Troposphere   (HALOTROP-SALT)'. Areas where enhanced levels of RHS are to be expected (like polluted coastlines or   polar regions) will be identified. Regional processes involving RHS will be set into a global perspective.",0,0

Deposition processes offer various options for a cleaner environment via novel and miniature rechargeable batteries with high energy density, cleanup of soils and water, as well as processing of industrial wastes by membrane separations. EU was leader in this field, but has now an ancillary role versus research carried on in USA and Japan. Although fundamental knowledge in the field is up to now mainly based on EU achievements, the number of patents is now unbalanced in favour of these two countries. EU industry suffers of lack of knowledge on some important production processes. Combination of skills in physics and chemistry, engineering approac hes are needed to enter this interdisciplinary field. The proposed advanced training courses on Micro and nano deposition aim at revitalise EU research by giving to young EU researchers sound fundaments to comprehend the different deposition processes, met hods to approach new scientific and technological problems, overview on the different possible innovative applications; deep understanding of the correlation between the performance of new functional coatings and the structure obtained through controlled d eposition processes; disseminating knowledge on micro and nano defined devices; showing to the participants the variety of combined and integrated solutions available to obtain a functional coating capable to avoid environmental problems.

561,74849,No,Nanostructured waterborne polymer films with outstanding properties,"The development of many industrial sectors (coatings, adhesives, cosmetics and additives for paper and textiles) is limited by the inability of existing technology to produce nanostructured polymer films via a sustainable technology. The objective of this industry-led project is to make possible a generation of radically-new products by developing a technology platform to produce films with controlled nanostructure without organic solvent or residual monomer, in compliance with impending European directives on solvent emissions. The breakthrough idea is to use waterborne nanocomposite (polymer-polymer and polymer-inorganic) nanoparticles with carefully controlled structure as building blocks for the films. Nanoparticle production, processing and properties (including biocompatibility) will be studied in an integrated technology platform. Industrialists will ensure the proper scale up and product development. Among the expected breakthrough properties are good adhesion to porous substrates, increased hardness, strength and wear-resistance with low dirt pick-up, higher impermeability to liquids and gases, and greater fire resistance. The technology will offer energy savings in production and transport. To achieve this objective, work programmes will integrate the contributions of 9 EC companies (including 3 SMEs) with that of academics from 12 centres of excellence. To retain and nurture European technological excellence, the project integrates activities in training and education along with programmes to exploit and disseminate the knowledge in the wider communities. As a result of the project, European industry - especially SMEs - will benefit from the introduction of new, value-added products into a competitive world market. As an example, in coatings alone there are 2500 European companies (including 1500 SMEs), employing a total of ca. 100,000 people and making products with a value of 15.4 billion Euros.",1,0
253,201292,No,Ex Anatolia lux. The Linguistic Origins of Europe: Word-formation and Lexicon in Anatolian and Core Indo-European.,"The understanding of the linguistic origins of Europe begins with Proto-Indo-European (PIE), the reconstructed language from which all Indo-European (IE) languages descend, including modern languages like English, Spanish, Russian and Hindi, and are spoken by more than half of the world’s population. In particular, a proper understanding of Proto-Indo-European begins with the extinct Anatolian languages, e.g. Hittite and Lycian, known from ancient clay tablets and inscriptions and spoken in the Asian part of Turkey and part of northern Syria during 16th-2nd century BCE. The Anatolian branch plays a key role since it was the first to split off from the IE language family and has several specific features, which are not shared by other IE languages. As the first of its kind, this project will shed light on the position and development of Anatolian in relation to the rest of the IE family by a systematic study of Anatolian word formation and vocabulary. The results will integrate a ‘free access database' established 2013 by the Research Centre ‘Roots of Europe’ (RoE), which will also be a new useful research instrument for other disciplines as philology, epigraphy and archaeology in a perspective of interdisciplinary collaboration and mutual benefit. The Roots of Europe, headed by my supervisor Prof. B. A. Rasmussen (Olsen) and based at the Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics of the UCPH, is the most appropriate institution for this project: the scientific expertise and interdisciplinary profile of the research team in the topics involved in the research, including a specific project of the IE homeland, the training and the knowledge transfer will be the winning combination not only for the achievements of the goals set up for my project, but also to make my profile as an independent researcher more competitive.",0,0
115,76014,Yes,Greenchem,"The aim of this Summer School is to teach young post-graduate students the innovative scientific and technological background to approach pollution prevention for industrial processes from the chemical standpoint. The European chemical industry is addressing environmental problems in the effort to solve them and at the same time to improve the safety and the environmentally acceptability of its processes.   Until recently the emphasis was placed on end-of-pipe remediation of environmental damage, rather than preventing it through smarter processes and more selective chemistry. The development of alternative clean syntheses for important industrial chemicals allows defining Green Chemistry as the use of chemistry for pollutant source reduction, and is aimed at sustainable chemical development and environmental protection. Its goal is to improve the quality of life and the competitiveness of industry.  To this end, significant challenges are available for chemists to design new less polluting syntheses. Much of the training in this area initially came from within companies, but now graduates who possess these skills have a competitive advantage. Teaching will cover the following basic themes (Industrial Processes, Alternative Solvents, New Feedstocks and Products, New Reactions and New Synthetic Methods), and special topics selected according to the availability of the teachers. Three main focus areas can be indicated.  1. The use of alternative synthetic strategies for green chemistry, such as: catalysis and biocatalysis, atom efficient processes, natural processes (photochemistry, biomimetic synthesis), alternative feedstocks.  2. The use of alternative reaction conditions for green chemistry, such as: use of solvents that have a reduced impact on human health and the environment, increased selectivity and reduced wastes and emissions. 1.

It should therefore be able to address fundamental questions, such as the origin and structure of space-time. The key to an understanding of these deep problems is to uncover of the symmetry principles that underlie string theory and to gain control of string theory in its non-perturbative regime. This project is motivated by some of the very recent progress in string theory, which is related to symmetry and integrability: the remarkable achievement in our understanding of the role and applicability of integrability in string and Yang-Mills theory on the one hand, and the discovery of the long sought after description of multiple coincident branes in M-theory. We feel it is extremely timely to form a partnership that combines researchers who have significantly contributed to these recent advances with the hope that our combined effort will lead to a further and deeper understanding of the underlying theory and its properties.

The 'ALPE 2' project represents an enlargement in scope and geographical coverage of the ongoing 'ALPE 1' project in the STEP Programme. In addition to the remote mountain lakes in the highlands of Norway and Scotland, in the Italian and South Tyrolian parts of the Alps and the French part of the Pyrenees considered in 'ALPE 1', the 'ALPE 2' project extends the investigations on lake sediments, water chemistry, diatom, invertebrate and fish fauna on lakes in Spitzbergen (Svalbard), the Irish highlands, Austrian Alps, the Czechoslovakian and Polish parts of the High Tatra mountains, the Spanish part of the Pyrenees, the Sierra Nevada in Spain and the Sierra d'Estrela in Portugal. Overall, in 20 remote lakes, situated above the local timberline, seasonal changes in major limnological, chemical and biological parameters will be studied in function of the air pollution deposition and of climatic factors. The investigations on lakes in the ongoing 'ALPE 1' project will be extended towards the determination of zooplankton (inventory and changes), the consideration of organic matter loading, the evolution of decomposition of plant material, trace metals, sulphate reduction capacity, and contamination by persistent organic compounds in selected lakes.  The whole coordinated measurement programme will be subject to stringent quality control measures, extensive statistical analysis and empirical modelling of palaeolimnological, limnological, biological and chemical data to:  - quantitatively reconstruct the historical development and to estimate the likelihood of future development of lake water pH; - to quantify the relationships between invertebrate assemblages and water chemistry (canonical correspondence analysis and weighted averaging); - to quantify the relationships between fish populations and environmental conditions; - to test for patterns of variation in lake-water chemistry within and between lakes over time (redundancy analysis, trend analysis, Monte Carlo permutation tests);  Finally it is intended to identify 'critical sulphur and nitrogen loads' and 'recommended target loads' for those remote mountain areas, to apply biological data to the establishment of guidelines for good monitoring and management practices, to establish baseline conditions for the long-term evaluation of impacts of climatic and environmental change.",0,0

684,84295,No,Macrofaunal impact on microbial diversity and organic contaminant degradation in marine sediments,"Marine sediments constitute important sinks in the cycling of persistent organic contaminants released into our biosphere. Yet, sediments storing old discharges have now become major environmental pollution sources accounting for the propagation of organic contaminants and subsequent adverse effects along marine food chains worldwide. Thorough understanding of sedimentary biogeochemical and ecological processes affecting organic contaminant fate is thus crucial for accurate predictions of contaminant effect s on marine food webs. Microbes, especially bacteria, are considered main organic contaminant degraders in sediments and are thus highly important for ecosystem decontamination. Our present understanding of microbial contaminant degradation in marine sediments is limited, yet macrofaunal bioturbation appear highly important, and macrofaunal burrow linings were recently identified as hot spots for the microbial degradation of organic contaminants.  The main research objective is to explore the influence of burrowing macrofauna on microbial community diversity and microbial PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbon) degradation in marine sediments. New molecular techniques (PCR-DGGE, RT-PCR) will be used to measure microbial diversity, and the presence/expression of microb ial PAH catabolic genes, along with traditional PAH degradation analyses. The fusion of molecular techniques, marine sediment ecotoxicology, and benthic ecology is a unique innovative aspect of the proposed research, involving extensive interdisciplinarity.  Aside from creating new knowledge on macrofaunal-microbial structure-function relationships in sediments, essential for the management of marine resources and habitats globally, the proposed project will generate a new ecotoxicological research direction.

462,37523,No,Dye photovoltaic cells for indoor applications,"Summary  The aim of this proposal is the technological development of dye photovoltaic cells, recently invented by the Swiss Institute of Technology (EPFL), from today's laboratory stage to highly reliable and reproducible products and to become producible by an industrially feasible manufacturing process. Dye PV cells will be optimized for indoor applications where laboratory cells have already shown promising I-V and stability performance. Through such applications, this new thin-film PV technology may be introduced to the market place even before the turn of the century, create new jobs in Europe and, ultimately, smooth the way for the technically more demanding outdoor applications. The high economical and ecological interest of such an approach relies on the increasing importance of stand-alone indoor power systems with a market portential in the order of 1 billion modules per year and the replacement of non-rechargeable batteries by a more sustainable technology. The new PV technology will directly challenge the Japanese domination in the field of amorphous silicon cells.  Specifically, dye PV cells will be designed for the fast growing market of electronic price labels in retail stores that fulfil the specifications of the end user with regard to power/size ratio, costs and mechanical requirements. Dye PV cells have the potential to offer more than twice the power output of commercial amorphous silicon cells of a given size and to be produced at relatively low costs. The calculation of cost prices of industrially produced raw materials and dye PV cell manufacturing will be a principle objective for the industrial partners. A pilot line for assembling up to 1 mio. PV modules (ca. 2.5 V) per year will be designed, allowing for a complete estimation of production costs.  In order to achieve the goals of the present proposal within the planned 24 months, a consortium of academic (EPFL, University of Uppsala) and institutional R&D laboratories (ECN, IVF), a large chemical manufacturer (DSM)t a specialist on glass/polymer and other polymer film based compounds (L.P.M.), a manufacturer of electrochemical storage devices (Leclanche) and an and user (Pricer) producing electronic price labels have joined forces.

932,220124,No,Advanced biohybrid lighting and photovoltaic devices,"InOutBioLight aims to design multifunctional rubbers with enhanced mechanical, thermal, color-converting, and light-guiding features towards advanced biohybrid lighting and photovoltaic technologies. The latter are placed at the forefront of the EU efforts for low-cost production and efficient consumption of electricity, a critical issue for a sustainable development. In this context, the use of biomolecules as functional components in lighting and photovoltaic devices is still a challenge, as they quickly denature under storage and device operation conditions. This paradigm has changed using an innovative rubber-like material, in which the biofunctionality is long preserved. As a proof-of-concept, color down-converting rubbers based on fluorescent proteins were used to design the first biohybrid white light-emitting diode (bio-HWLED). To develop a new generation of biohybrid devices, InOutBioLight will address the following critical issues, namely i) the nature of the protein-matrix stabilization, ii) how to enhance the thermal/mechanical features, iii) how to design multifunctional rubbers, iv) how to mimic natural patterns for light-guiding, and v) how to expand the technological use of the rubber approach. To achieve these goals, InOutBioLight involves comprehensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and mechanical studies to investigate the protein-matrix interaction using new polymer matrices, additives, and protein-based nanoparticles. In addition, the mechanical, thermal, and light-coupling features will be enhanced using structural biocompounds and reproducing biomorphic patterns.

In my project I propose an interdisciplinary research at the interface between plant systematics, population genetics, and ecological and evolutionary genomics. I will use the novel rapidly developing high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques which open previously unseen opportunities for studying complex evolutionary processes in plant populations. The potential of such methods in deciphering complex polyploid genomes is, however, still limited mainly due to insufficient knowledge of the genome of the wild plant under study. My project will overcome this gap as it focuses on Arabidopsis arenosa, an overlooked yet extremely promising species that represents the closest wild di-polyploid relative to the key plant model system A. thaliana. I intend to bring and analyze my unique comprehensive set of A arenosa samples (>120 populations) at University of Oslo – a renowned research institution with wide experience in HTS applications and data handling. I aim to examine the overall genetic structure of the species, reveal evolutionary history of the polyploid lineages, and assess the diversity of candidate loci under selection across the species’ range. The project will advance our understanding of evolution and diversity of plant systems, with practical implications in biodiversity conservation, agriculture, and pharmacology. In the course of the project I will significantly improve my skills of leading-edge scientific methods (analyses of high-throughput sequence data) and I will strengthen my position as an independent scientist by getting training in project management and international collaboration.",0,0
986,103904,No,New bio-inspired processes and products from renewable feedstocks,"Within the FP7 PEOPLE project (Blue4Glue), Fraunhofer Institute (IFAM) and Procter and Gamble discovered a (PPO based) enzymatic process used by marine-organisms, which “produce” polymers in a much simpler way (less process steps) than industry does in classical chemistry. BIO-MIMETIC aims to transfer this new scientific knowledge into a blueprint for a novel (pre-)industrial enzymatic-based bio-polymerization process. It involves research partners (IFAM and UNITOV) with experience in enzymatic transformation and bio-based synthetic polymers, as well as expert SMEs such as Dyadic (enzymes), CIMV (biomass transformation into bio-chemistry) and CULGI (computational modeling of bio-chemical processes) to develop the process that firstly transforms biomass (lignin) into new bio-based polymers (pseudo peptides). These will used to create respectively: 1) Bioconjugated copolymers, that will be tested in detergents (by P&G) 2) Bio-cross-linked adhesive gels, to be experimented in antiageing cosmetics and in bio-textiles preparation (by an SME cosmetic producer MAVI). Potential environmental benefits are over 124 kton/yr less toxic solvents to produce chemicals, over 1 Billion kWh of energy savings (room temperature process) and a drastically reduced CO2 footprint i.e. replace 8000 Mtons of petrochemical based deposition aides and in the future substitute a large amount of phenol and phenolic derivatives, which are used to produce chemical intermediates for a myriad of applications. BIO-MIMETIC will carry out LCA and LCC (cost) assessments over the value chain as input to business plan and will use a new SME LCA tool (cCALC) to develop an LCA showcase, which will come available for SMEs. The cCALC tool and showcase will be freely downloadable as part of the exploitation plan targeted at the market uptake of project results in the emerging European market of bio-based products, projected to grow towards 250 billion Euro by 2020.",1,0
754,217336,No,Low Curing Temperature and Energy Efficient Powder Coatings,"Worldwide demand for powder coatings has increased over the last few decades based on their excellent durability and finish, easy application and low environmental impact. Thermosetting powder coatings cure between 180ºC-200ºC and need beyond 20 minutes curing depending on the resin and cross linker used. Its application takes place in big ovens (2x7m2) and the energy consumed during the curing process represents nowadays 50% of the total operational costs of the applicators, which are either coating enterprises or directly product manufacturers (OEMs). A major challenge for powder coating manufacturers is therefore to offer their customers more energy-efficient products by reducing the polymerization temperature and increasing the speed of the reaction. PulverCoat is a new generation of advanced thermosetting powder coatings that polymerize at lower temperature (110ºC-130°C) with a reaction mechanism 10 times faster than common powder coatings, enabling curing to take place in just 3-5 minutes. The use of PulverCoat will therefore significantly improve the energetic yield of the application process, representing a total energy saving between 40 – 70% depending on the dimension of the painted part and, consequently, reducing the financial and environmental impact of this operation. Furthermore, this low curing temperature range enables its use for coating heat sensitive substrates, like wood and plastic. Moreover, our new generation of advanced powder coatings has shown additional advantages, such as improved, outstanding resistance to UV radiation (50% better than common polyesters), and excellent anti-graffiti properties thanks to its dense net of amino bonds grants. The PULVERCOAT project is expected have a significant impact on our company, PUVERIT: forecasted sales in 2025 will render revenues of €45.9 million, and a total of 90 new jobs will be created in the first five years of commercialization.",1,0

Right project will provide a semantics-based healthcare information infrastructure, to seamlessly integrate services and information, that, through a proper level of care Knowledge Management and a Decision Support System, will support knowledge driven collaborative practices in Networks of Health Care Professionals of new member States, in order to minimise medical errors in diagnosis and treatment.  To achieve this objective has been essential to constitute a Consortium gathering technical and scientific partners, users and multipliers coming from across the Europe and in particular from the new member States allowing the necessary integration of the research effort in ICT in an enlarged Union. Pursuing its aim, the project will first of all contribute to build enlarged Europe in a field, as HC, fundamental for the future of the EU 25, for its social integration and in which all Member States, and particularly new ones, are active.

582,217704,No,Innovative dual cycle tracking system for contraception and conception on a single device,"Women usually track their menstrual cycle for three main reasons: As a natural contraceptive tool, to increase the chances of conceiving or for health-related reasons. However, monitoring every stage of the cycle in an accurate manner has proven challenging, due to the many variables influencing its progression (e.g. irregular periods, stress, etc.). Currently, there are two main approached to cycle tracking:  Cycle tracking devices (which represent the old-fashioned approach, fairly reliable but require self-assessment and expertise to get accuracy), and “cutting edge” app-based cycle tracking methods (which are user-friendly, but rely in subjective facts related to the period - e.g. length or amount of bleeding-, traditional measurements -e.g. core body temperature- and algorithms, and lack accuracy. Hence, none of these approaches fulfils the “golden” criteria of being reliable, precise, simple and non-invasive.  At Carbomed, we strive to overcome the limitations of both approaches thanks to our innovative ILO system, the seamlessly combination of a handheld device and an app, that reliably predicts the time of ovulation by relying on a scientifically-based method: Measuring the CO2 levels from exhaled air. ILO conveys the best features from both approaches, being accurate, simple and non-invasive while providing a user-friendly experience thanks to our bespoke app. ILO can be used as a dual cycle tracking device predicting the most fertile window, as a natural contraceptive method, but also as a tracking device for those who want to get pregnant.  For Carbomed, ILO represents a large business opportunity, aimed initially at the child wish market and subsequently (and most importantly) at the contraception market valued at €17.6 billion back in 2016. In this way, we expect to sell 180,500 ILO units in the first three years of commercialization, reaching cumulative profits of €23.39 million by 2023. To reach this goal, we will increase our staff count by 700%.",0,0
435,98468,No,Origins of the Vernacular Mode. Regional Identities and European Networks in Late Medieval Europe,"Based on comparative studies and contextualisations of European vernacular religious literatures, this project aims at new insights about the dynamics of regional ( vernacular ) identity formation in the 14th and 15th centuries. The investigation will focus on intellectual elites linked in close, supra-regional networks, who gradually introduced the  vernacular mode  in the dominant theological discourse; at the same time, they increased the symbolical charge of the vernacular languages. The core period studied in the project will be the second half of the 14th century, a period in which new forms of institutionalisation and discursive orientation of  ecclesiastic and lay powers began to take shape, and directions were taken that should prove decisive for further development. At the time, Prague was the political and intellectual centre of the Holy Roman Empire, but its international impact is grossly understudied. The project will therefore mainly deal with the rich and little-known production of Czech religious literature. It sets out to reconstruct the personal networks engaged in the creation, translation and propagation of vernacular religious literature, and in the formation of textual communities and cultural identities at the treshold from Latin to the vernaculars.",0,0
269,103429,No,Development of functionalized nanostructured polymeric membranes and related manufacturing processes for water purification,"The NANOPUR-project aims at leveraging on promising bottom-up technologies to develop intensified water treatment concepts based on nano-structured and nano-functionalized membranes as well as nanofilm deposition for micropollutants and virus removal. Major research needs targeted include the preparation of membranes with selective properties at the nanoscale able to maintain high permeability with relatively low driving force. The ultimate “challenge” exists in the creation of artificial membranes able to perform separations with the selectivity of biological membranes while having mechanical strength and productivity of state-of-the-art artificial membranes. The project will advance the knowledge in this area by developing scalable approaches to prepare nano-structured membranes characterized by a selectivity towards pathogens of up to 99.99999 % and towards micropollutants up to 99 %, while retaining a permeability higher than  current ultrafiltration membranes in addition to functional stability equal to existing commercial membranes. The envisaged research activities will involve the preparation of polymeric nano-structured membranes characterized by well-controlled architectures and functions for supramolecular recognition for removal of viruses, hormone disruptors, endotoxins and antibiotics from water. For the generation of affinity and catalytic sites on membranes, molecular imprinted polymers and atmospheric pressure plasma treatment will be explored. The technological developments will be carried out along two different technology paths each targeting at a different aspect of the water treatment process. A first research path will focus on the reduction of membrane fouling thereby enhancing the flux while the second research path targets the removal of micro-pollutants and detoxification. Both paths will converge in order to combine the two critical aspects of water purification that are investigated in the proposed work in one single membrane process",0,0

INTEGRATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY A two stage gasification system starting with CFB gasification will be integrated into an existing coal fired power plant. The gas generated from waste/alternative fuels will be combusted with the boiler coal and substitutes part of it. DESCRIPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY The overall process includes the following main steps: In a daughter company of SWF plant modifications will be performed to reduce particle sizes and to remove metals in order to optimize the alternative fuels/municipal waste as feed to the proposed gasification system. Between AWZ and SWF fuel transport will be established. The fuels delivered to SWF will be processed as follows: After intermediate storage and the resulting homogenization the fuel will be dried and then gasified in a CFB gasifier with air. The ash dust containing product gas is directly routed to the gas reformer where by addition of air the temperature is increased such that hydrocarbons are cracked. The ash withdrawn from the bottom of the CFB gasifier may be deposited or used in the construction industry. Heat is recovered from the hot gas to produce steam. The gas is filtered, quenched and cleaned in a multistage scrubbing system before mercury is removed by adsorption. The clean gas is routed to existing CFB boilers. Desulfurization takes place in the boiler system. The scrubber water blow down is purified in a separate water treatment system. The major part of the filter dust is vitrified in a side stream unit. INNOVATIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY - The integration of a waste/solid fuels CFB gasification with an existing coal fired power station - size reduction and drying of waste/alternative solid fuels for optimizing its use in CFB gasification/gas reforming - production of gas and vitrified ash in a two stage gasification system with air - use of air gas gasification medium and drying of waste/alternative solid fuels in order to optimize the process - no requirement for supplementary firing with natural gas or oil as other processes do when using low LHV input material - product gas cleaning downstream of the gasification system for meeting the requirements of power stations permitted for coal firing - use of the existing flue gas cleaning of the power station without modifications - treatment of waste water from product gas cleaning in reducing atmosphere - overall reduction of emissions - avoidance of the abuse of additional valuable country side as industrial sites by integration of the proposed system with existing power plants. Nevertheless, there are not restrictions to use the proposed technology in stand alone plants. COST SITUATION Assuming that after the monitoring phase the plant availability will be increased from 6700 to 7500 operating hours per year. - both trains will be operable (120000 tons per year) - in future plants equipment may be simplified according to operating results - waste treatment cost may be reduced to values lower than 300 DM per ton.",1,1

In case of success the developed products correspond to a potential market of at least 100 tons per year for applications, like the hot air conditioning tubes and the de-icing systems of the nacelles and of the leading edges of all European subsonic civil aircraft where the substitution of pure titanium by the new aluminium alloys could bring a weight saving of 20 to 40%, that is between 100 and 200 kg per aircraft, depending on its size. The main technical problem arising in the design of such a material comes from the necessity to marry two requirements which seem to be inconsistent: the alloy must be stable at 300øC, which means that it must keep high mechanical properties up to 300øC, but at the same time the alloy must be processable in conventional equipments, such as extrusions presses, with limited pressures. which means that the alloy must soften sufficiently at the temperature of working, that is 460 to 500øC. without any modification of its microstructure. So the developed process, defined by the following steps:   - alloy composition,  - atomization of powders,  - cold and hot consolidation,  - hot working,  - final in house manufacturing technologies,   will have to produce a material with high mechanical properties and good creep and fatigue resistance up to 300øC that can be processed with conventional equipments without damaging of its microstructure that might be detrimental to its performance, so as to fabricate large parts at a cost acceptable for the foreseen applications, that is inferior to 25 ECU/kg   The research will be achieved by completion of the following tasks: - Optimisation of the consolidation / extrusion process of Al-6Fe-V P/M alloys  - Investigation of mechanical alloying and ceramic particle reinforcement on a dilute version of the A1Fe-V alloy  - Evaluation of thermal stability and creep properties of the different products and selection of one process  - Fabrication of large extruded and rolled products in the selected alloy/process  - Full characterization of the sheets and extrusions and study of the influence of in-house manufacturing processes on the final properties - Total process analysis - definition of guidelines for a global process optimized in regard to cost and performance of the product  - Evaluation of the project: final technical and economical analysis - indications for further developments",0,0
708,52078,No,Long-term performance of permeable reactive barriers used for the remediation of contaminated groundwater,"Problems to be solved Contaminated land, landfills and sediments pose a serious environmental threat by polluting groundwater in the surrounding area. In 14 European countries contamination caused by uranium represents a particularly serious danger where drinking water resources might be affected. Other heavy metals and organic pollutants can also have a strongly deleterious effect on groundwater. Available technologies (e.g. pump-and-treat) fall short of solving the problem because their performance is not yet adequate for effective remediation. Permeable reactive barriers (PRB) represent a promising innovative technology for passive in-site groundwater remediation. Little is known, however, about the long-term behaviour (formation of coatings and precipitates, reduction of permeability) of PRB systems. Scientific objectives and approach The aim of the project is to elaborate the scientific basis for, laboratory and pilot-scale testing of and the practical application of a considerably more efficient and cost-effective in-site reactive barrier technology targeting groundwater contaminants. General objective is to evaluate and enhance the long-term performance of PRB systems, especially of those targeting heavy metals and organic contaminants using sorption and/or precipitation mechanisms. The approaches taken to meet the project objectives will be the characterisation of different reactive materials and relevant attenuation processes in the reactive matrix of the PRB and their long-term behaviour. Technological methods to enhance the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the PRB system will be developed and tested under realistic conditions. The primary model test site will be an area in southern Hungary contaminated by uranium mining - thus including a region which is due to become part of the European Union. Expected impacts The results of this project are expected to play a major role in establishing the permeable reactive barrier technology as an accepted, reliable and cost-effective method for the remediation of contaminated groundwater. The broad spectrum of activities within the proposal offers considerable utilisation opportunities. The investigation of potentially suitable reactive materials for specific target contaminants and the clarification of attenuation processes and ageing mechanisms will enable the optimisation of reaction conditions and barrier design. New technological developments like specially tailored contaminant-targeting ligands and electro kinetic enhancement are aimed at improving the effectiveness of the groundwater-cleaning task of PRB systems. The anticipated spread in the application of PRB systems will also necessitate regulation. As far as we are aware, the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) in Berlin is currently the only regulatory body in Europe in a position to develop guidelines and regulations on reactive barriers. The project will develop a schematic, long-term effectiveness assessment method for lifetime prediction. The results of the project will therefore also influence the future sanctioning practice of such remediation systems by the responsible authorities.  Contaminated land, landfills and sediments pose a serious environmental threat by polluting groundwater in the surrounding area.

Many  natural resources (e.g. minerals, water, soil, biomass, land and fuels (energy) are used to grow and process food products, but in many cases their usage is highly inefficient, due to the lack of technological solutions and knowledge in combination with uncertainties about health and safety issues. Another important challenge in the food chain management is the large amount of wasted food. RESFOOD will overcome the main bottlenecks and barriers leading to an Resource Efficient Food Chain by: • Developing innovative technologies for re-use of Nutrients, Energy, Water and Biomass, reducing input, maximizing resource productivity and minimizing waste • Develop new methods for improving the disinfection processes for vegetables ensuring appropriate monitoring of health and safety risks. • Validate the solutions in five on site pilot demonstrations, also including Life Cycle Assessment In the RESFOOD resource efficiency concept the focus is a cascade approach: Look first for the most efficient solutions with the lowest effort, like direct re-use of warm and cold water (and energy) nutrients and biomass, followed by more complex solutions like withdrawal of useful products and energy  from the water and the recovery of high valuable components from food waste (biomass). This will lead to 30 to 75 % reduction of water, energy and nutrients use, 25 to 80 % less emissions to surface-  and ground water, 20-30 % reduction of the use of fertilizer products and overall 20 to 30 % more crop per resource input, combined with better controlling and reducing food health and safety risks.",1,0
343,215663,No,The role of maternal microbiota in offspring lung development and function,"In early life, interactions between our microbiota and our bodies are key elements to health and disease prevention. While it is known that microbiota drives development of the gut mucosa, it is unknown which influence microbiota has on the development of the lung in early life. I have recently discovered large biologically and statistically significant effects between maternal probiotic treatment during pregnancy, maternal gut microbiota changes and alveolar development in mouse offspring. This type of effect has never been shown before and modulation of microbiota with probiotic bacteria thus appears to support lung development and could possibly intercept lung diseases. With “ProLung”, I want to reveal the mechanisms behind this effect on lung development. I will do that by determining; the timing of the effect, which microbiota is more important and what genes are differently regulated in dams and their pups. I will show causation by transferring microbiota and phenotype to germ-free mice. Finally, as a “proof of concept”, I will develop and employ an oxygen driven disease model of infant lung dysplasia and show if modulation of microbiota can enhance breathing and could be used to intercept this early life lung disease.   The proposed “ProLung” action will be conducted under world-class supervision at University of Copenhagen, Denmark with strong partners, in a highly cross disciplinary international collaboration with University of Oxford (UK), University of Michigan (US) and co-funded by the world second largest chemical company Dupont.

17,107837,Yes,Gene expression profiling of plant vascular tissue in model and crop species,"Plant vascular meristematic cells are present in the cambium and procambium and divide in a highly ordered manner resulting in cells that differentiate into xylem tissue (responsible for water transport), and phloem tissue (which transport nutrients). Lodging due to breakage of plant stems negatively impacts crop yields, and remains a problem in species such as rice and wheat. Vascular tissue contains cells with woody secondary cell walls that provide much of the plants mechanical strength so modifying developmental processes that lead to vascular specification has the potential to improve yield. Furthermore, the vascular system is responsible for generating the majority of plant biomass. Plant biomass could be utilised in the future to make the next generation of liquid biofuels reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Understanding the events that occur in the vascular meristem may help us to best utilise plants for increased biofuel production.  Gene expression maps, where levels of expression of all the genes in the genome in specific cell types have been quantified are extremely useful in identifying genes that control specific processes in the model species. However, there is a lack of similar data for economically important species such as rice. Novel methodologies will be required to generate this expression data as fewer resources are available for these species. This IOF will allow the researcher to learn these methods in Sorghum and tomato in the outgoing phase of the fellowship, prior to applying them in a comparative study of Arabidopsis and rice in the return phase. Individual cell types of the plant vascular system will be isolated using novel methodologies and their RNA will be extracted and sequenced using state-of-the-art techniques. The data will provide an important reference for further research and lead to identification of key genetic components of plant vascular development that could be manipulated to improve grain and biomass yields.",0,1
378,97658,No,Systems Biology of Colorectal Cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in both males and females, and it is perhaps the best understood of all epithelial tumors in terms of its molecular origin. Yet, despite large amount of work that has concentrated on understanding of colon tumorigenesis, we still do not know the full complement of molecular lesions that are individually necessary – and together sufficient – to cause colorectal cancer. Neither do we understand why some specific mutations that are relatively rare in other tumors (e.g. loss of the APC tumor suppressor) are extremely common in colorectal cancer. We propose here to use the tools of systems biology to develop a quantitative and comprehensive model of colorectal tumorigenesis. The model will include a “wiring diagram” that identifies cell-type specific and oncogenic pathways that contribute to colon tumorigenesis, and explains in molecular detail how a genotype of an individual CRC leads to activation of downstream genes that drive uncontrolled cell growth. This model will subsequently be used to find novel therapeutic targets, to guide genetic screening to identify individuals with elevated risk for developing CRC, and to classify patients into molecular subgroups to select the treatment combination which is optimal for each patient (personalized medicine). The specific objectives of the SYSCOL project are: 1. Identify genetic markers for individual risk using genotyping and sequencing of germline DNA from sporadic and familial CRC cases and controls 2. Identify genes and regulatory elements that contribute to colorectal cancer cell growth 3. Use data from Aims 1-2 to develop a quantitative model for colorectal tumorigenesis 4.

877,101044,No,Enhanced reliability and lifetime of ceramic components through multiscale modelling of degradation and damage,"Engineering ceramics possess superior mechanical and physical properties. The exceptional wear, corrosion and contact fatigue resistance of silicon nitride and SiAlON ceramics makes them attractive materials for high temperature metalforming tools and rolling elements for bearings. Despite the efforts devoted to study this class of materials, there still exists a gap between their microstructural properties and their potential application limits. Developing multiscale predictive models that deliver information on materials degradation mechanisms, based on realistic working conditions, will enable the systematic tailoring of ceramic materials for new applications, supported by validated evaluation techniques including tribology, damage analysis, and lifetime predictions. The optimisation of the microstructure is clearly application-dependent and should rely on co-related material development efforts and multiscale simulations. The bridging between the microstructural properties and macroscale behaviour should merge the knowledge acquired from the atomistic, microscale, mesoscale and macroscale levels. Nonetheless, the chain of information would not be complete without including means of validation that rely on experimental techniques and functionality tests in real applications.",0,0
1002,222322,No,Astrocyte-neuron COmmunication in METabolism and obesity.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes have been increasing during the last decades, becoming highly prevalent diseases in our society. Until very recently, astrocytes and other glial cells have been traditionally known as supportive cells to neurons, but the host research group led by Prof. Matthias Tschöp has recently reported that insulin receptors (IRs) in astrocytes regulate glucose delivery into the brain and lack thereof leads to a reduced response of glucose-induced suppression of food intake (Garcia-Caceres et al., Cell 2016). These data, together with previous findings, suggest a new paradigm in which astrocytes interplay with neurons in the CNS control of metabolism, body weight, and energy balance. However, the molecular underpinnings remain to be investigated. My main objective is to test the hypothesis that astrocyte-neuron communication is required for maintaining a normal energy homeostasis, and its impairment contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity. To achieve this, I will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) technology to examine whether astrocyte activity is required for maintaining a normal energy homeostasis. I will generate two transgenic mouse models (dnSNARE mouse and iBot mouse) to specifically interfere with the release of gliotransmitters in order to test whether astrocytes release vesicles to regulate the activity of hypothalamic neurons in the control of energy metabolism. Finally, I will investigate whether hypercaloric diet disrupts astrocyte-neuron communication, thus contributing to obesity progression. This project has the potential to reveal new mechanism(s) of metabolic homeostasis and how its impairment explains the development of obesity. Moreover, this proposal will enhance my individual competence in terms of skill acquisition and creativity through an advanced training in a privileged host environment; representing all together a significant contribution to the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.",0,0
301,90229,No,Epigenome and Cancer Susceptibility,"Early detection is crucial for the outcome of most cancers. Prevention of cancer development is even more desirable. To facilitate these ultimate goals we aim to construct a comprehensive view of the stepwise process through which common human cancers, such as colorectal cancer, arise. In particular, we aim to identify novel mechanisms of cancer susceptibility by focusing on the epigenome, whose alterations may underlie several phenomena related to chronic adult-onset disease that are not explained by genetics alone. The stepwise process of carcinogenesis can be accelerated or halted for various reasons, including inherited susceptibility and diet. The human multi-organ cancer syndromes hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as well as their murine counterparts, the Mlh1\/- mouse and the ApcMin/\ mouse, will be used as shortcuts to study the interplay between the epigenome and genome in tumorigenesis and to identify biomarkers of cancer susceptibility, malignant transformation, and tumor progression. This will be achieved by molecular profiling of normal and tumor tissues, cell line studies, in vitro functional assays, and in silico approaches. Additionally, the role that the epigenome plays to mediate the effects of the Western type diet on colorectal tumorigenesis will be examined in the mouse. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible, which makes them promising targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions.",0,0
605,198308,No,Training Engineers and Researchers to Rethink geotechnical Engineering  for a low carbon future,"TERRE aims to develop novel geo-technologies to address the competitiveness challenge of the European construction industry in a low carbon agenda. It will be delivered through an inter-sectoral and intra-European coordinated PhD programme focused on carbon-efficient design of geotechnical infrastructure. Industry and Research in the construction sector have been investing significantly in recent years to produce innovative low-carbon technologies. However, little innovation has been created in the geo-infrastructure industry, which is lagging behind other construction industry sectors. TERRE aims to close this gap through a network-wide training programme carried out by a close collaboration of eleven Universities and Research Centres and three SMEs. It is structured to provide a balanced combination of fundamental and applied research and will eventually develop operational tools such as software for low-carbon geotechnical design and a Decision Support System for infrastructure project appraisal. The research fellows will be involved in inter-sectoral and intra-European projects via enrolment in 8 ‘Joint-Awards’ and 7 ‘Industrial’ PhDs. The research fellows will be trained in low-carbon design by developing novel design concepts including eco-reinforced geomaterials, ‘engineered’ vegetation, engineered soil-atmosphere interfaces, biofilms, shallow geothermal energy and soil carbon sequestration. Distinctive features of TERRE are the supervision by an inter-sectoral team and the orientation of the research towards technological applications. Training at the Network level includes the development of entrepreneurial skills via a special programme on ‘Pathways to Research Enterprise’ to support the research fellows in establishing and leading spin-out companies after the end of the project.",0,0
774,227940,No,Chemical Approach to Scalable Fabrication of Hybrid Plasmonic Materials in the Strong-Coupling Regime,"The full control over the nanoscale behavior of light holds incredible potential for the realization of various next-generation technologies with dramatic impact on society, offering revolutionary solutions for cleaner energy resources, faster optical communication systems, data storage and computing, and a more sustainable future (UNESCO’s Sustainable Development Goals number 7 and 9). Strong-coupling light-matter interaction has been the subject of extensive fundamental physics research, while chemists have so far contributed only marginally to its development. Progress in nanosynthesis and nanofabrication have created the perfect environment for the chemistry community to step in and guide the field towards a new class of photonic materials operating in the strong-coupling regime. This proposal will capitalize on my diverse and multidisciplinary training in the fields of chemistry, plasmonics, nano-optics, and materials science for the realization of complex plasmonic architectures coupled with various emitters to establish strong-coupling interactions. I will explore the use of light to modify the energy landscape of these chemical systems, and control their emission and reactivity. I will investigate the fundamental aspects of light-matter interactions (e.g. anisotropy, delocalization, and chirality) and its application for the realization of new plasmonic chemistry at the nanoscale. The expertise of the NANOPTO group and the top facilities available at the Institute of Materials Science of Barcelona and the proposed secondments at UCT Prague and LMU will be instrumental for my career development and constitute an important asset for my personal progression as a scientist. I will acquire new skills for the fabrication and characterization of macroscopic-scale plasmonic devices and extend my scientific network, and improve my mentoring expertise, with the final goal of securing seed funding for a stable group leader position.",0,0

The final outcome will be a method of producing a sterilised growing medium within a sealed environmental bag, which will then be used to produce mushrooms and other crops.

1037,101625,No,Modelling of Adaptive Wing Structures,"An adaptive wing tip concept will be developed to enable controlled wash-in and wash-out throughout the entire flight envelope. The concept, based upon adaptive stiffness structures enables control of the aeroelastic deflections, and also facilitates gust load alleviation. Furthermore, a mathematically based design tool will be developed making use of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) of the wing structure and aerodynamics such that an inverse approach can be employed to determine the required sizing of the internal aircraft structure, and also the position and sizing of any adaptive structural components and actuators. The adaptive structural concept and the inverse ROM approach will be demonstrated and evaluated on two real-size aircraft test cases.",0,0
870,102135,No,Development of NEXT GENeration cost efficient automotive CATalysts,"The main objective of NEXTGENCAT proposal is the development of novel eco-friendly nano-structured automotive catalysts utilizing transition metal nanoparticles (Cu, Ni, Co Zn, Fe etc) that can partially or completely replace the PGMs. Based on nanotechnology, low cost nanoparticles will be incorporated into different substrates, including advanced ceramics (SiO2, perovskite etc) and silicon carbides, for the development of efficient and inexpensive catalysts. The main idea of the proposal is the effective dispersion and the controllable size of the metal nanoparticles into the substrate that will lead to improved performance. To this end a modified polyol process as well as chemical and physical treatment of selected substances will enable the introduction of transition metal nanoparticles on the catalyst substrate precursors via adsorption and ion-exchange. The presence of metal ions sorbed on fixed precursor sites will inhibit the agglomeration during heating and final products with very fine particle dispersion and tuneable metal content will be obtained. It is expected that the developed catalysts will exhibit increased catalytic performance, even at low temperatures (200-250oC). Other key properties of the proposed nanostructured catalysts include: increased thermal stability (avoiding aggregation), improved durability, capability of reuse and recovery of transition metals as well as low health and environmental impact. Apart from the scientific innovations and the environmental impact, the proposal holds also great economic importance. Taking into account that the autocatalyst industry uses extremely large quantities of precious metal-68% of Pt and 72% of Pd in Europe – the impact of replacing PGMs is of tremendous significance. Based on the current metal prices, it is estimated that the developed catalysts will reduce the catalyst cost at about 40-50%, opening the way to an efficient adaptation of nanotechnology-based catalysts in the automotive sector.",1,0
702,221998,No,In Situ Probing of transition metal-oxide heteroInterfaces for high-peRformance solid-state Energy devices,"Improving energy efficiency, reducing emissions and increasing the share of renewables are among the primary targets of the EU. To achieve these goals, solid-state energy devices, including solid oxide cells (SOCs), have gathered significant attention. In recent years, advances in material design have opened up unprecedented opportunities for development. For example, compared with either single phase, heterointerfaces of transition metal oxides (TMOs) exhibit orders of magnitude faster ion exchange/diffusion kinetics in SOCs. However, there is continuous debate regarding the origin of these enhancements, mainly due to limited instrumental resolutions compared to the nanometre length scale of heterointerfaces. The underlying electrokinetic mechanisms must be understood and quantitatively determined so that we can rationally design interfaces with superior properties. This will open up new avenues in the low-temperature SOC (LT-SOC) applications. To this end, we propose an in-situ study of a range of heterointerfaces using both Low Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy and recently installed, one-of-a-kind and high-resolution Plasma Focused Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy. We will design strain-engineered vertically aligned composite nanostructures (VAN) of TMO heterostructures using Pulsed Laser Deposition. VAN design allows for strain tuning in electrodes with thicknesses reaching micrometre length scales, thus paving the way for potential commercialisation. The performance of these heterostructures will be investigated for LT-SOC applications, targeting higher outputs at lower operating temperatures (300-500°C). This project combines the candidate’s expertise in SOCs with the host institute’s unique surface characterisation capabilities. This work is expected to form a cornerstone in the researcher's academic career while significantly contributing to boosting European excellence by studying a highly topical research question.",0,0
489,6603,No,HUMAN-ORIENTED PRODUCTION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN FOR SMALL BATCHES,"The following results have been obtained from the HOPE project contributing to the improvement of the production organisation of SMEs with small-batch production:   - Reports about the trends and techniques concerning production restructuring, including production programme analysis tools and human- oriented production organisations.   - A methodology to analyse and redesign the production organisation of SMEs with small-batch production.   - Various tools that support the methodology, among which:    - A workshop to determine the success factors of a company.    - The HOPE Analysis Guide, to provide a holistic company analysis.    - The PDL, a tool to describe, analyse and redesign production structures, including human-oriented Production Basic Types (PBTs) and Service Basic Types (SBTs) that combine machine configuration, organisational structure and workshop communication of a production organisation. Suitability profiles for the Basic Types have been developed as well as guidelines to combine the Basic Types into a production organisation structure.    - IMAPS, a tool for the evaluation of various alternative production structures on economical as well as human-oriented performance indicators.   ! The methodology and its tools have been documented in a reference manual which forms a practical guide for structuring improvement projects.   - The PBTs and SBTs have been validated in a benchmarking project.   - The methodology has been applied and validated at three end-users in different sectors. Results of the restructuring process included a decrease of delivery time by 40%, reduced stock levels by 20%, decrease of quality problems by 25%, and an increase in day-to-day yield by 20%. In general, flexibility at the end-users has been increased and the organisational as well as the communicational structures have been improved considerably.   - A project has started within the CEC-Innovation programme to further develop the benchmarking tool and to establish a European database with production performance data of SMEs with small-batch production. The heavily discussed MIT study headlined 'lean production' shows how much potential is left unused in the structure and organization of the mass production of automobiles. Following our experience, there is a greater potential in the structure and organization of the small batch production. Long throughput times, great stocks and organizational overhead are characteristics for the small batch production of today. The workshop structures, in addition, are very sensitive to breakdowns and behave in an unpredictable and sometimes chaotic manner. Only the human skills of improvisation and flexibility prevent the increase of technical and organizational problems. These problems are caused by non-linear structures in the production and a multi-step manufacturing. A method is missing to find the right production type or a combination of different production types which fulfills best the requirements of making high-quality products at short throughput times and at low costs. Another important aspect is that no method exists to combine the production structure with human-oriented organizational techniques and matching communication concepts. This heavily slows down the dissemination of state-of-the-art and future structuring techniques and human-oriented organization concepts in the proudction of SMEs.  The aim of the HOPE project is to develop an advanced methodology of production engineering and design for small batch production. By this robust structures can be achieved to provide low throughput times combined with high productivity and flexibility. The outstanding flexibility of human beings in managing delays and breakdowns is the crucial point in this project and will be supported by useful services. It is the first time that machine configuration, organizational structure and workshop communication are treated as equal components for structuring the workshop.",0,0
416,104359,No,Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of amines and amides,"'Amines and their acylated derivatives – amides – are among the most common chemical functional groups found in modern pharmaceuticals.

18,67412,Yes,Maximum energy yield from organic wastes and decontamination to a high quality organic fertilizer by a microbiological hybrid process (ENERDEC),"Objectives and problems to be solved: Based on an existing organic waste treatment hybrid process B.S.F.C., in which the waste is separated in a liquid fraction for anaerobic digestion and a solid fraction for composting, the project objective is to establish an environmentally beneficial process with optimised utilisation of all output mass flows in terms of maximum energy yield and valuable soil fertiliser by performing the following measures: - improving energy production for different new organic waste materials; - upgrading of the biogas for use in the natural gas grid and in future in fuel cells; - depletion of heavy metals and salt in raw material to improve compost quality; - development of an economically acceptable method to reduce N and P contamination in the liquid digested residues for recycling into the process and environmental protection. Description of Work: - For maximum biogas output and cost effectiveness applicability tests of CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor) and FBR (fluidised bed reactor) for digestion of the liquid fraction will be performed with new waste substrates from the leather industry and slaughterhouse at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. - For the upgrading of biogas a small scaled prototype will be constructed and operated at the SME proposer MFN. To fulfil a cost effective cleaning system biological/chemical and physical methods will be combined. Therefore the prototype will consists of a bio trickling filter for removal of H2S, an activated carbon filter for removal of AOX and hydrocarbons, and an gas membrane filter for removal of CO2. - Variation of separation techniques and parameters in laboratory and technical scale at the waste treatment plant of the SME proposer SESA are necessary to find the key parameters for depletion of heavy metals and salts in the solid fraction, which will be composted to obtain a valuable soil fertiliser. - For flexible and environmentally friendly management of digested residues solid/liquid separation experiments of digested residues by centrifugation and evaluation of solid digested residues drying systems are necessary. The applicability of composting of digested residues in technical scale has to be examined. To find out the most cost-effective solution for the N- and P-removal from the liquid digested residues investigations of SBR (sequential batch reactor), bio filtration and phosphate precipitation will be done. Hygienic monitoring of the process will be carried out by bacteriological tests. Expected results and exploitation plans: - Maximising the energy yield from the digestion of organic wastes - Biogas upgrading to meet the requirements for the natural gas grid - Depletion of heavy metals and salts in compost below the limit values for first grade soil fertiliser- Removal of N- and P-contamination from liquid digested residues below the limit values of direct discharge into the environment.",1,1
