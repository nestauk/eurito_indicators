669,223840,No,LAUNCH: sustainable energy assets as tradable securities,"The LAUNCH project will look to overcome barriers to aggregation and market scaling, accelerating the development of the SEA as tradable securities. Today the SEA market is splintered over many project and contract types, small portfolios and many methods for assessing project risk. This smothers market growth today and will continue to do so in the future. Contracts and risk assessment protocols must become standardised, in order to encourage market growth in a manner which will lay the groundwork for and accelerate the scaling of project finance in the future. Indeed, in order for the sustainable energy market to reach its full potential, we must lay the groundwork required to accelerate the development of Sustainable Energy Assets (SEA) as tradable securities. This is the aim of the LAUNCH project. This will be done through, setting up systems to prepare SEA developers for equity investment, standardising developer-end client contracts, and creating a commonly agreed set of risk assessment protocols. The consortium has wide market reach and access to best in class materials. LAUNCH will develop these deliverables further in direct cooperation with a representative group of the European Finance Industry and a substantial pool for SEA developers and pilot them in real market conditions in cooperation with SEA developers and funds. The combination of development with key players and immediate real-life uptake, will ensure the project results are market ready and fully exploitable. The project will provide a basis for accelerated and sustainable SEA market growth and aims to create a European standard for the SEA market going forward. The main resulting benefits will be accelerated growth of the SEA industry, including substantial job growth, energy and CO2 savings and further standardisation of SEA, laying the groundwork for their acceptance as tradable securities.",0,0
22,208428,Yes,TUTOR: A universal Learning Management System for Robot-based learning,"In this digital age, a change in learning/teaching method is being fuelling by the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and interactive media (digital whiteboard, tablets, robots, etc.) in schools. Among them, the use of robots with age-school children improves their motivation and learning process by 75%. A notable obstacle to implement robotics widely as part of schools’ curriculum appears to be the involvement needed from educators (teachers, therapists, etc) in the generation of contents and experiences, which today requires programming or coding knowledge. Aiming at overcoming this barrier, our company InterOnLine has developed TUTOR, a novel Learning Management System for leveraging education based on the use of robots, that allows non-computer skilled users create, manage and transfer learning units (LUs) for robots out-of-the-box. We have detected our potential capabilities to define and design our own educational robot in which run TUTOR, in order to maximize the business opportunity in the innovative Robot-Learning sector. This way, we will develop a fully functional product (LMS software \ hardware) that will provide a mechanism for our sustainable growth. By enrolling an Innovation associate we will be able to leverage this innovation strategy. In order to achieve the objectives for develop and implement TUTOR project, we need to reinforce our team with a PhD in robotics engineering with knowledge and experience in educational and pedagogic methodologies. The recruitment of the IA will help us to accelerate the high growth of our company, by means of the following expected impacts: reinforcing experience and knowhow of our team, developing the new line of products for the future of our company and boosting our business opportunity, reaching 4M€ by 2020 once full product has been launched.",1,1

541,204136,No,Children and social robots: An integrative framework,"Robots used to be made for labor; now, they are increasingly also made for relationships. Social robots can learn from us, teach us, play with us, and assist us. With the market for social robots expected to grow substantially in the next 20 years, social robots are likely to become a life-changing technology similar to personal computers or smart phones. Still, we still know little about one of the most intriguing, relevant, and timely issues in this process – children’s interaction with social robots. Children are not only increasingly recognized and targeted as early adopters of new technologies; they may also be more susceptible to potential effects of interacting with robots than are adults. As research on child-robot interaction (CRI) is still a fragmented field, the main aim of the proposed project is to develop an integrative framework of CRI. This framework synthesizes theories and concepts from communication research, human-robot-interaction, as well as developmental and social psychology in an entirely new way. It will focus (1) on the antecedents of children’s acceptance of social robots; (2) the con-sequences of CRI for children’s learning of social skills from social robots and their relationship formation with them; and (3) the processes that explain why such effects emerge.  The project combines survey and experimental research, thereby bringing an unprecedented, but much needed multi-methodological approach to the field of CRI. Focusing on 8-9 year-old children, the project will also provide two crucial methodological innovations: (a) the creation an inventory of standardized measures for CRI and (b) new procedures and research designs to study long-term CRI. In its pioneering focus on a disruptive new technology, its theoretically unifying character, and its original methodological contributions, the project will not only define the field of CRI, but will also present a completely new agenda for it.",0,0
50,60507,Yes,"The Politics of Higher Education in Europe: A Comparative Analysis of the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom","Research objectives and content:  The present project intends to analyse the recent transformations of Higher Education Institutions in four European countries: the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  These countries, as most European and OECD ones, are currently taking up similar challenges: development of new technologies; emergence of new social and industrial demands; new forms of labour markets; economic and budget constraints.  In order to face this major societal evolution, changes have been implemented within the education system, in particular tertiary education. Nevertheless, the timing of Higher Education policy reforms as well as the extent and the forms of the transformations have differed from one country to the other. In that sense, if challenges are largely common, responses seem to reflect national specificities. This project intends to analyse the causes of these differences and highlights the impact of the political and institutional structures on the production and implementation of new Higher Education policies.  Training content (objective. benefit and expected impact)  - Improve personal research skills in an English-speaking academic environment which provides major material and intellectual support; - Permit to undertake personnel and original investigation and to take advantage of the progress of the work to draft scientific papers; - Provide better understanding of the impact of the national political and institutional context in the production and implementation of a public policy; - Adopt an interdisciplinary approach of issues in Higher Education by turning to cone and theoretical tools frequently used in Sociology and Political Science.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  - analyse how the required 'usefulness' of Universities, introduced by most new Higher Education policy reforms, is translated into effective collaboration with companies at the local, regional and national levels; - Highlight the nature and extent of these new links between Universities and Industry",1,1
478,215239,No,Infant Theory of Mind,"The project aims to advance knowledge of the development of Theory of Mind - the ability to reason about other’s beliefs. Specifically, the project will combine brain imaging techniques with adaptations to typical Theory of Mind tasks that will allow major theoretical advances in the understanding of infant social cognition. The use of brain imaging techniques to study the development of Theory of Mind is an upcoming research strategy made possible by recent advances in lower-cost infant appropriate techniques such as function Near Infrared Spectroscopy and places this project at the cutting edge of the field. Previously the experienced researcher has sought to evaluate the mechanisms underpinning corvid’s and children’s social behaviours and the Supervisor has independently sought to evaluate the mechanisms underpinning responses to complex social stimuli. The current project uses their joint backgrounds to facilitate the development of innovative behavioural paradigms that, in combination with the use of imaging techniques pioneered by a collaborating research lab, will allow the team to address key questions in infant Theory of Mind research. In addition to the research aspects of the proposal the project will allow the experienced researcher to learn to use imaging techniques on infants and will involve the dissemination of research through publications and conference talks. Furthermore, both the experienced researcher and Supervisor will continue their commitment to undertaking public engagement programs and are excited about exploring the new opportunities for exploiting their research that the project ensues.",0,0
981,82841,No,Multi-scale modelling and simulation for nanoscale mechanics and materials: from atoms to devices,"After five years in the US, first as a doctoral student at Northwestern University and later as a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), the researcher intends to return to his home country, Spain, and accept a tenure-tra ck four year position as an assistant professor at the Universitat Politica de Catalunya, Barcelona. The proposed research aims to develop methods that bridge the gap between accurate atomistic models of matter and meaningful predictions for micro and nano-scale complex devices, engineered systems, as well as biological systems, with a focus on the mechanics of crystalline solids and macromolecules. In many applications of interest, this gap exists because a wide range of temporal and spatial scales are operative and interact in a complex manner. This renders simple models useless and accurate atomistic calculations unable to access relevant scales, and calls for multi-scale models. While there have been numerous advances in modelling and simulation across multiple scales, satisfactory theories and technologies are far from being achieved.  This proposal intends to push the frontier of knowledge in this field, to validate the new methods against micro and nano-scale experiments, and to apply these methods to problems of basic science and engineering. This interdisciplinary research, at the interface of applied mathematics, computational engineering, materials science, physics and biology, will benefit from the experience of the researcher on the mechanics of carbon nano-tubes at Northwestern University, and on multi-scale computational methods at CalTech. The US has vigorously invested efforts in the last years in the proposed field of research, and plays a dominant role. Thus the project contributes the EU competitiveness in an area, which can strongly impact the field of nano-bio-technology. The project involves the training of a doctoral student.",0,0
943,193249,No,Lifecourse biological pathways underlying social differences in healthy ageing,"'The dramatic differentials in healthy ageing, quality of life and life expectancy between individuals of different socioeconomic groups, is a major societal challenge facing Europe. The overarching aim of the LIFEPATH project is to understand the determinants of diverging ageing pathways among individuals belonging to different socio-economic groups. This will be achieved via an original study design that integrates social science approaches with biology (including molecular epidemiology), using existing population cohorts and omics measurements (particularly epigenomics). The specific objectives of the project are: (a) To show that healthy ageing is an achievable goal for society, as it is already experienced by individuals of high socio-economic status (SES); (b) To improve the understanding of the mechanisms through which healthy ageing pathways diverge by SES, by investigating lifecourse biological pathways using omic technologies; (c) To examine the consequences of the current economic recession on health and the biology of ageing (and the consequent increase in social inequalities); (d) To provide updated, relevant and innovative evidence for healthy ageing policies (particularly “health in all policies”) that address social disparities in ageing and the social determinants of health, using both observational studies as well as an experimental approach based on the existing 'conditional cash transfer' experiment in New York. To achieve these objectives we will use data from three categories of studies: 1. Europe-wide or national surveys combined with population registry data;  2. Cohorts with intense phenotyping and repeat biological samples (total population >33,000); 3. Large cohorts with biological samples (total population >202,000). The cohorts will provide information on healthy ageing at different stages of life, based on the concepts of life-course epidemiology ('build-up and decline') and multimorbidity.  '",0,0

124,110679,Yes,Revitalizing EFL Teachers' Professional Development in Europe through Innovative Programs,"Education First (EF) has been testing millions of adult English language learners’ proficiency for the last two years. According to their 2012 English Proficiency Index , Turkey is in the “low proficiency” category and shares the 32nd ranking among 54 countries in the survey. It is stated in the EF report that “Europe’s English is the best of any region, but some European countries need to get serious about teaching English to a high level if they are to keep up with their neighbors.” (p.3).  The current project, EFL Teachers, shares EF’s concern; therefore aims to make significant contributions to the foreign language learning endeavors of people in Europe, particularly in Turkey. Unlike traditional research which generally examines individual student characteristics and teachers’ instructional practices in the classroom, this project takes EFL teachers as the starting point with the standpoint of  “language teachers themselves are language learners, too.” The researcher will first analyze EFL teachers’ individually guided activities and identify the needs for innovative professional development programs, then develop a website for resource-sharing, hold workshops on reflective practice and emerging technologies as well as designing and delivering professional development webinars for EFL teachers.  The EFL Teachers project has three objectives to achieve: 1) to investigate foreign language teachers’ professional development activities in Turkey in order to identify any needs for new professional development programs, 2) to analyze the current professional development practices in two purposefully-chosen European countries: Italy and Sweden, 3) to create new professional development programs (e.g., webinars and workshops) based on these needs, and 4) to share the programs with the target population and the general public.",1,1
154,103041,Yes,"Teaching in the 21st Century: Responding to Bullying and Safeguarding Issues in Scotland's Schools, a Longitudinal Study of Teacher Trainees","Over the last 50 years, school education has increasingly become one of the most important areas for government policy.  This is in part due to the recognition that a highly educated population is a key determinant of economic success.  This has led countries to search for ways to improve the education of children and young people.  Within schools, however, there is a significant barrier to learning that exists. Evidence is emerging of the negative impact of bullying has on the learning environment for children and young people.  Teachers are at the forefront of witnessing and responding to bullying behaviours in school settings, yet many teachers feel less than confident in addressing such behaviours.  Initial Teacher Education is an important time for potential teachers to learn about how to respond to behaviour management issues within the classroom. Several studies have examined teacher trainees’ knowledge and attitudes regarding bullying.  No study to date, however, has conducted a longitudinal assessment of teacher trainees across their first post of teaching.  This study will employ a longitudinal design that will follow a cohort of students in their final year of teacher training at the University of Edinburgh’s Moray House School of Education into their first year of teaching through the Teacher Induction Scheme, a paid year-long placement in teaching.  200 students will take an electronic baseline survey and follow-up surveys at 12, 18 and 24 months.  In addition to the longitudinal surveys, 20 students from the study will be randomly selected to participate in a baseline and 24-month in-depth interview.  This study will be the first of its kind to longitudinal examine issues of bullying and safeguarding as it relates to teacher training and support.  This will also be the first study to examine these issues with teacher trainees in Scotland.",1,1
191,33803,No,Software product advanced certification and evaluation - user focus,"Until recent years, the Information Technology society has focused its attention on the software development process and software process improvement. However, improvement of the software process does not guarantee the 'fitness-for-use' of software products, as experienced by the actual user. Recent European projects and standardisation efforts have addressed software product quality, but primarily from a 'technical' point of view. Other projects aimed at user related software quality, but only partly covering the software quality spectre as described by ISO 9126. Users now feel an increasing need to be able to assess the 'fitness-for-use' software quality. Manufacturers wish to be able to prove this quality by means of generally accepted standards. They intend to reduce the 'time-to-market' and the number of software changes of release by taking the user needs into account effectively, in an early development stage. User oriented software quality principles will not only improve the effectiveness of the evaluation of software products in final development stages, but will also improve the specification of software, as the basis for software design and evaluation of intermediate products.  The main objective of the project is the development of the SPACE-UFO methodology for specification and evaluation of software product quality requirements with an emphatic user focus. A second main objective is the acceptance of the methodology by the IT market so that it becomes a widely recognized de-jure or de-facto standard which may be considered as a best practice. Derived objectives are the development of techniques and tools which support the application of the methodology and the dissemination of results.  The results of the project will be: - The SPACE-UFO methodology. User oriented software quality depends on characteristics of the user(s), business, environment and product profile. The SPACE-UFO methodology translates these profiles into software quality requirements and evaluation criteria. - Methods, techniques and prototype instruments, allowing software quality specification and evaluation to be deterministic but flexible. Required new methods, techniques and tools will be developed; usable existing materials will be adapted if necessary. - Training materials. These will consist of an 'academic' and an 'industrial' package, which will include syllabi, illustrations and case-studies.  The project will be divided into eight workpackages, each further subdivided into tasks. The technical workpackages comprise development of the SPACE-UFO methodology, framework, development of techniques and tools for user oriented quality specification and evaluation, experimentation on the application, validation of the methodology and development of training materials. Supporting workpackages consist of technical coordination and integration, dissemination of results, market research, exploitation and project management.  Application of the SPACE-UFO methodology, techniques, tools and training material will enable users to assess the quality of software. This will result in better 'fitness-for-purpose' and lower costs and risks. Benefits for software developers will be that user needs can be taken into account for software quality specification and evaluation and that software can be evaluated with respect to user needs. This will lead to reduction of the number of releases and of the time-to-market. Evaluators will be able to evaluate the software quality in a deterministic and widely accepted way. The methodology, methods and techniques are expected to affect existing and newly developed standards and methods, including software process improvement.  The results will be licensed to end-users and other organisations. They will be used by the participants for their software evaluation, consultancy and training services, which will be available to the European market. The industrial partners will apply the results for internal software product improvement and reduction of product time-to-market. The results will be disseminated to the IT market by several means. The methodology and techniques will be submitted for international standardisation in order to contribute to the international harmonisation and standardisation efforts.",1,0

CAST will give a set of requirements for selection of future air traffic controllers and guidelines for ab-initio training for future air traffic controllers and transition training for current air traffic controllers. The overall objective of the CAST project will be the identification of consequences for controller selection and training deriving from the new working environment due to the new functions and system automation strategy.   To achieve the overall objective, the CAST project has the following objectives:  1. To define the change in tasks, selection and training requirements for air traffic controllers (ATCO's),  2. To provide a framework for recommendations for future selection and training processes, aimed at maximising training effectiveness and efficiency,  3. To provide functional requirements for the training and selection processes and associated equipment.  An inventory will be made of current and future ATM systems, current ATCO tasks and current selection and training processes. On the basis of the inventory significant transition issues will be described, being the scope of the project. Additionally, future ATCO tasks and profile will described for the future ATM systems described in the inventory. Based on the inventory and the future ATCO profile and tasks, selection and training consequences and requirements will be identified. Where possible, illustrative examples will be developed for selection and training. The outcomes of the project will be presented (and discussed) at a presentation/workshop.  %",0,0

CYPRESS’ Coordinator, the Research Promotion Foundation (RPF), as the National Agency for supporting Research and Innovation (R&I), has within its remit gained a long experience in organising activities for the promotion of R&I towards the public and especially the younger generation, with the Researchers’ Night events being an integral part of its philosophy since 2006, with or without EC support, but always with vivid support from the National Research System.  RPF has secured the collaboration of all Universities in Cyprus, the major Research Institutes and Centres, R&I-intensive Enterprises (mainly SMEs), Public Authorities, End Users and the Civil Society and for the first time Industrialist and Employers’ Associations, covering the Quadruple Helix of Innovation in a complementary way. As a novelty, RPF will also utilise a bottom up approach to attract new partners and will establish links with international partners.  Building on past experiences, CYPRESS will bring together researchers from all sectors and disciplines, along with the public, increasing appreciation of the researchers’ work, raising awareness on the importance of R&I for society and the economy and motivating children to take up a career in research. Through a balanced mix of educational and entertaining, interactive activities, aiming at people of all ages, genders and educational backgrounds, and with the contribution of volunteers from the partners and RPF, the events will celebrate R&I achievements, especially EU funded and will ultimately remove stereotypes about the researchers’ profession, creating a much needed R&I culture among the Cypriot population.",1,1

565,205754,No,A multi-method perspective on children's use of rehearsal in serial recall tasks,"Rehearsal is a key construct in models of immediate memory and refers to the overt or covert repetition of items to counteract forgetting. A long-standing assumption is that children younger than 7 years do not engage in rehearsal, as such children tend not to show key ‘experimental effects’ thought to be signatures of rehearsal. However, given a growing debate in the adult experimental literature on the interpretation of these effects, and more recent concerns in the developmental literature about how one should understand changes in their magnitude, the questions of when rehearsal develops, and the role that it plays in supporting serial recall in children become open once again. These are theoretically and educationally important questions that cannot be addressed with the methods currently being used, and so the proposed project adopts a novel combination of three particularly informative approaches to properly address these issues. These methods from different traditions of memory research are: self-paced presentation times to index the pauses that participants insert into a task to allow rehearsal, rehearse aloud protocols that capture the participants’ rehearsal behaviour by making this overt, and trial-by-trial self-reports of strategy use. In total, 210 children between the age of 6 and 10 years will participate in three inter-linked experiments using these methods, with the relevant covariates of short-term memory capacity, working memory capacity, and articulation speed also being measured. A major strength of the proposal is that state-of-the-art multi-level modelling of the data will allow for modelling of both participant and task effects on trial level strategy use, avoiding the problems inherent in traditional analyses. This multi-method design coupled with multi-level modelling will give unparalleled insight into the validity of different methods of strategy assessment and into the key issue of children’s strategic behaviour in memory tasks.",0,0
848,8786,No,An Advanced and Comprehensive Methodology for Integrated KBS Development,"The KADS-II project will deliver a methodology that covers the life-cycle of KBS projects, provides standards both for project control and system development, and bridges the gap between KBS development methods and other methodologies. By thorough validation and active dissemination efforts, the project aims at making the KADS-II methodology the accepted standard for KBS development in the European IT industry. The project delivers a methodology that covers the life cycle of knowledge based system (KBS) projects, provides standards both for project control and system development, and bridges the gap between KBS development methods and other methodologies. The methodology rests upon a theoretical description of KBS construction in terms of a number of models describing different aspects of a KBS. These models, constructed at varying levels of abstraction, lead to a complete set of methods and techniques which support the process of KBS development. A major objective of the project is to develop further this theoretical basis in such a way as to facilitate a formal specification of the model to support prototyping as a development technique, and to enable the optimal use of reusable components. The project recognizes the important issue of acceptance and usability of the methodology. Results will be validated through an active systems development programme and an on going process of dissemination. A major theme of the project is to facilitate acceptance of the methodology by ensuring that its tools and techniques are compatible with more conventional approaches to systems development in terms of both delivery environment as well as structure and contents.  A unified knowledge modelling approach has been established with supporting tools (CommonKADS model set, common modelling language, ML2). A KBS development life cycle including risk and quality management concerns is defined and has to be experimented on through applications. The architecture of the future workbench has been fixed, and generic libraries of knowledge items are under development. The approach taken in KADS-II is derived from that developed within project 1098, KADS, which stressed the idea of an iterative process of methodology construction. The methodology rests upon a theoretical description of KBS construction in terms of a number of models describing different aspects of a KBS. These models, constructed at varying levels of abstraction, lead to a complete set of methods and techniques which support the process of KBS development. A major objective of the project is to further develop this theoretical basis in such a way as to facilitate a formal specification of the model to support prototyping as a development technique, and to enable the optimal use of reusable components. Recent insights in areas such as generic tasks, problem-solving methods and second-generation KBS techniques will be incorporated. Throughout its duration KADS-II will deliver a number of systems based on the methodology.   In addition, the project recognises the important issue of acceptance and usability of the methodology.

384,203356,No,Cell intrinsic control of CD4 T cell differentiation by cytosolic DNA sensing pathways,"This proposal aims to investigate the role of cytosolic DNA sensing pathways in CD4 T cell differentiation. Cellular host defense to pathogens relies on the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which can be recognized by host myeloid cells through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 binding. Recent evidence however suggests that innate immune cells can also perceive cytoplasmic DNA from infectious or autologous origin through cytosolic DNA sensors triggering TLR9-independent signaling. Activation of cytosolic DNA sensor-dependent signaling pathways has been clearly shown to trigger innate immune responses to microbial and host DNA, but the contribution of cytosolic DNA sensors to the differentiation of CD4 T cells, an essential event for shaping adaptive immune responses, has not been documented. This proposal aims to fill this current knowledge gap.  We aim to decipher the molecular series of transcriptional events triggered by DNA in CD4 T cells that ultimately result in altered T cell differentiation. This aim will be addressed by combining in vitro and in vivo approaches such as advanced gene expression analysis of CD4 T cells and use of transgenic and gene-deficient mice.

The focus will be on social creativity in the design of digital media intended to enhance creativity in mathematical thinking (CMT). The project will develop the 'c-book' (c for creative) extending e-book technologies to include diverse dynamic widgets, interoperability, collective design and an authorable data analytics engine. It will employ a range of creative industries involved in CMT (publishers, developers, researchers, school educators) and unite them in four distinct Communities of Interest with the shared goal to creatively think and design c-book resources reflecting 21st century pedagogy for CMT in schools and the workplace. The partnership includes four creative SMEs, the coordinator blending technological, academic, systemic and publishing expertise and five academic partners holding a unique combination of expertise and experience integrating a) CMT theory and practice; b) design for CMT activities; c) development of dynamic constructionist widgets for authorable e-book tools; d) design and development of AI infrastructures for collective creative activities. The emergence of creativity in digital content design is perceived as 'a system' involving collectives with tools. It will advance our knowledge by integrating two constructs for professional design, the 'documentational' approach and the 'boundary crossing with the use of digital media' approach. The results intend to have economic, societal, scientific and technological impact. The project will help re-steer recent economy of scale initiatives in digital resources for mathematical thinking from traditional paradigms to 21st-century engagement and creativity in school and the workplace.",1,0
3,108350,Yes,"""""Investing in Education in Europe: Attitudes, Politics and Policies""""","'Comparative welfare state research has neglected the study of education for a long time. In particular, very little is known about citizens’ attitudes on education policies and how these attitudes are reflected in processes of policy reform. The core of the proposed project is to conduct an original survey in eight European countries to provide, for the first time, internationally comparative data on individual attitudes and policy preferences on education. Individual attitudes are conceptualized to vary along three dimensions: the level of investment in education relative to other social policies, the promotion of different kinds of education (academic versus vocational education) and the distribution of competencies across levels of governments (governance). Particular attention will be paid to policy feedback effects, i.e. how macro-level institutional contexts (welfare states) shape the dynamics of preference formation on the micro level. Thus, the ultimate goal is to be able to understand cross-national variation in policy attitudes. The second phase of the project will analyze the linkages between attitudes and policy-making, using the insights from the survey. In the form of case studies of recent education reforms, we will ascertain whether policy-makers cater to public opinion in general, particular electoral constituencies or organized interests. The project breaks new ground by expanding research on welfare state attitudes to the field of education policy and improving our general understanding of the linkages between citizens’ preferences and policy-making.'""",1,1
891,47521,No,Developpement de la formation et marche du travail,"1. Objectives The proposed project analyses the consequences of the increasing number of post secondary education graduates on the functioning of labour markets in five European countries, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. It also includes a systematic comparison with the situation in the United States of America, which, due to the different development and regulation of its higher education system, provides a contrasting reference scenario for evaluating policy options and implications for Europe. A multi-national will conduct the research and multi-disciplinary group of research teams that include sociologists, economists, management experts, as well as statisticians specialized in studying the education - employment nexus. The proposed project duration is 30 months. The proposed project relates to area two of the third call for TSER proposals: Research on Education and Training. As such the project fits in with the general objective to improve the common state of knowledge about education and training in Europe and to provide policy relevant information for the different actors and decision-makers involved in education systems. Specifically, the proposed research addresses the issue of the effectiveness of education policies in serving the needs of the economy. The project, therefore, directly relates to theme II.  3) 'Education & Training and Economic Development' of the call for proposals, and then to task II.  4) 'Education &Training and Economic Growth' but also offers strong links to task II. l 'Lifelong Learning . The core theme of the project are the interactions between the growing social demand for education, changes in national education systems, and the functioning of labour markets. The project consists of a cross-country comparison of these interactions. In as much as it focuses on the education -employment nexus and education is a powerful determinant of individual labour market success, the project is also relevant for issues addressed under theme III of the TSER programme. Over the past decades, all European countries have experienced a significant rise in formal educational attainment levels due to a strong increase in post-compulsory and specifically post-secondary education participation. This process has been a pervasive phenomenon, although its dynamics and configurations have varied according each country's specific historical evolution, culture, and education policies. In response to the growing social demand for education, national education systems have undergone substantial transformations which, in turn, have fueled increasing education participation. At the same time, most European countries have witnessed a strong increase in the number of jobs requiring higher-level skills which in many cases, however, falls short of - at least in quantitative terms - fully accounting for the rise in educational attainment levels of the labour force. This is manifested by the fact that the shift towards higher-level skill requirements has been accompanied by a strong increase in unemployment specifically of young labour market entrants which has also affected those with higher-level educationcredentials among them.  These developments raise a set of questions: First, do the observed growing discrepancies indicate increasing structural mismatches between skillssupply and demand in the sense that a growing number of labour market entrantshave acquired the wrong type of skills ? Or do they indicate that skills supplyhas been outpacing skills demand ('overeducation') ? Certainly, education and education policies alone cannot guarantee a successful integration ofyoungsters into jobs. However, countless studies have reaffirmed that education investments are closely related to employment and economic growth. In order toprovide an answer to the above questions, it is therefore necessary to analyze the links between education and employment and the diffusion of competencesacquired through education within the economy from a crosscountry comparativeperspective taking into account the specific institutional configurations ofeducation systems and labour markets in each country. From a policy perspective, the above developments raise the issue of the 'social construction' and dynamics of the continuing trend towards longereducation participation and higher education credentials and the ensuing increase in the number of highly educated workers in the labour market. It hasbeen argued that the pervasive trend towards longer education participation and higher educational attainment levels in Europe, which gained signilicantly inmomentum during the 1980s, has for long rested on an implicit consensus betweenthe different parties and actors involved in the process: (i) reflecting thestrong credentialist element in most European labour markets, youngsters, incompeting for scarce jobs, have been induced to aspire to ever higher educationcredentials in order to improve their prospects of being hired into employment;(ii) employers, in turn, have an interest in hiring as many highly educatedworkers as possible, all the more so when higher skills acquired through education mean productivity improvements and are provided free of charge;(iii) policy makers, finally, in order to prevent adverse responses from voters, strive to keep youth unemployment rates low (through 'parking' youth in the education system) and are reluctant to infringe upon the concept of free access to education. The ensuing increase in the supply of more and more highly educated labourmarket entrants in a situation of persisting high unemployment has necessarily had important effects on the rules and criteria governing access to employment, the functioning of labour markets, and on firms' utilization of skilled labour. It can be hypothesized, however, that over long, however, these changes inthe mechanisms governing the allocation of workers to jobs are likely to call into question the very implicit consensus that has engendered them, as actors'modify their strategic orientations and options.  This calling-into-question of the original consensus underlying the education expansion is likely to takedifferent forms in the different countries.Identifying the potential breaking points of the consensus requires (a) aanalysis of the development and specific configurations of the'education-employment nexus' in different countries, (b) a better understandingof the behavior of employers vis-a-vis the increase in highly educated laboursupply, and (c) empirically-based medium-term projections which take intoaccount the directions of observable general trends, their shaping byinstitutions and the latter's inherent inertia, as well as the varying dynamicsof the different national education and employment systems. These three pointsdescribe the prime objectives of the proposed research. Within this framework, the cross-country comparative perspective of the research serves the purpose ofboth sharpening our understanding of national developments and trajectories andof providing guidelines for designing appropriate public education policies atthe national and Community levels. 03",1,0

Moreover, European innovation in new drug registrations is dramatically falling behind compared to the US and Asia. The principal aim of the AEGIS ITN is to implement the first comprehensive, intersectoral cross-disciplinary and structured curriculum for doctoral students in the European Research Area by establishing a unique training platform for the next generation of European researchers in early drug discovery. A significant added value is provided through networking with key European pharmaceutical companies. A key research aim of AEGIS is improving the efficiency and success of early stage drug development by combining innovative methods and techniques to tackle difficult but promising targets (i.e. protein-protein interactions), as potentially valuable drug targets are often neglected due to the high risk associated with their validation. The consortium joins leading academic and industry researchers in an open innovation environment for innovative drug development in Europe. It is supported by several additional partners and stakeholders in the field. Integrated training of the fellows takes place at the host institute and by secondments, research schools and individual training within the AEGIS network. The scientific training includes complementary skills, management, intellectual property rights, fund raising, communication and career planning. AEGIS will improve the availability of a highly skilled workforce for European industries and research, greatly enhance the employability and the career perspectives of young researchers for academia as well as for industry, and will be the seed of a sustainable development in innovative drug discovery, in particular for rare and neglected diseases.",0,0

369,103258,No,DEVELOPMENT OF BIOACTIVE NANOCOMPOSITES FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS,"Bone has a remarkable capacity to heal. However, in some instances the amount of bone which is needed to heal exceeds its healing capacity. These cases arise following accidents, infection or surgery to remove cancerous tissue and they result in the need to perform approximately 600,000 surgical bone grafting procedures annually. These procedures have inherent disadvantages and so there is an urgent clinical need to develop a tissue engineering alternative to bone grafting. In this study an osteoconductive/osteoinductive nanoscaffold will be designed to retain growth factors with proven osteogenic potential within their structure. As such, relatively low doses of these expensive molecules can be retained at the bone defect site. The technology developed in this study has enormous potential to reduce the overall burden placed on patients and on European healthcare systems by reducing the costs involved in using Growth Factors in a variety of applications. To perform this work the Fellow will move from Athlone Institute of Technology, Ireland to join a leading orthopaedic research group at one of Harvard University’s teaching hospitals where he will be trained in nanotoxicity testing, detection of growth factor release, cell loading and orthopaedic preclinical models. The Fellow has extensive knowledge in the field of biomaterials and orthopaedic research having trained at the AO Research Institute, Davos, Switzerland. However this fellowship will allow him to develop his knowledge in the field of biocompatibility testing. Knowledge developed in this area will be transferred back to Europe during the return phase of the fellowship. This knowledge will allow the Fellow to further refine the research carried out at Harvard. The goal of this research is to develop translational solutions to clinical problems.

Some regions are more vulnerable than others, both to physical changes and to the consequences for ways of life. The proposal will assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water in mountain regions. Modeling techniques will be used to project the influence of climatic change on the major determinants of river discharge at various time and space scales. Regional climate models will provide the essential information on shifting precipitation and temperature patterns, and snow, ice, and biosphere models will feed into hydrological models in order to assess the changes in seasonality, amount, and incidence of extreme events in various catchment areas. Environmental and socio-economic responses to changes in hydrological regimes will be analyzed in terms of hazards, aquatic ecosystems, hydropower, tourism, agriculture, and the health implications of changing water quality. Attention will also be devoted to the interactions between land use/land cover changes, and changing or conflicting water resource demands. Adaptation and policy options will be elaborated on the basis of the model results. Specific environmental conditions of mountain regions will be particularly affected by rapidly rising temperatures, prolonged droughts and extreme precipitation. The methodological developments gained from a European mountain focus will be used to address water issues in regions whose economic conditions and political structures may compromise capacities to respond and adapt, such as the Andes and Central Asia where complex problems resulting from asymmetric power relations and less robust institutions arise. Methodologies developed to study European mountains and their institutional frameworks will identify vulnerabilities and be used to evaluate a range of policy options.",0,0

In the Institutes of Higher Education Pilot, Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (Germany), University of Oulu (Finland), and Universidade de Coimbra (Portugal) will jointly create courseware on the topic 'Fundamentals of Computer Graphics' by using tools for co-operative authoring and on-line communication. These institutes are connected via terrestrial links and satellite. The resulting courseware will afterwards be used in their lecturing activities. Students (about 200 in total) can access this courseware in computer labs at their university (electronic classroom) as well as at home (home learning). Remote tutoring and group learning will be supported.  In the SME Pilot, seven courseware providers will jointly create courseware on the topics 'Parametric Design', 'Telematics Usage', and 'Quality Management'. Customised versions of these courses are delivered to approximately 20 SMEs. The SMEs in rural areas in Portugal are connected to the LTC via satellite modems. The trainees (about 150 in total) can access the courseware either from their working place or in training labs of SMEs, specialised in providing training to external customers. The SMEs involved in this pilot are located in Germany, Greece, Portugal, and the Netherlands.  As a result, IDEALS will deliver a client/server based learning and training system, consisting of a client application, running at the learner's workplace, powerful servers, running at the LTCs, and a distributed database.

In this development, molecular simulation will play an important role in both the interpretation of the experimental data as well as to guide the experim ental efforts. Key aspects in the present proposal is that we plan to achieve this goal by a hierarchical approach, which relies on an intelligent and controlled way of combining advanced simulation techniques to bridge the time and length scales between t he molecular behaviour and the macroscopic properties. To demonstrate the interdisciplinary character of this approach we plan to apply this approach to two different applications related to molecular system biology and molecular materials science. Within the framework of system biology we aim to obtain fundamental insight in the collective behaviour of peptides embedded in a biological membrane and in material science we will investigate the effect of confinement on diffusion and catalytic properties.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK The work will begin with the review of the state-of-the-art. Relevant users will be identified and classified and a questionnaire will be distributed among them in order to extract relevant information about their main needs and requirements. Local authorities, traffic systems manufacturers, traffic operators and end users (drivers) will be contacted, when possible meetings with these users will be conducted in order to get a more complete appreciation of their needs. The main system requirements and socio-economic constraints will be extracted as conclusions from both user requirements and current system capabilities. The task will also define preliminary methods and indicators for the evaluation of the system. User requirements will then be translated into technical specifications of the system as a whole and of the individual modules. An accurate analysis of the evidenced user needs and system requirements will be the next step. The final result will be a system architecture design that uses the UML Methodology. The development of the project's first prototype will be done on the basis of the previous analysis and design work already mentioned. This comprises the implementation and integration of all project modules. An evaluation plan will define the evaluation methodology to be used in the project. The development of the first prototype will be tested in laboratory. Issues such as the integration of modules, the compliance of the operation of the system with the technical specifications, the reliability, communications, etc, will be assessed. On the basis of the first prototype, the project's final prototype will be implemented: specific developments will be made in each evaluation site, in order to adapt the system to the site characteristics and to enable its further installation and evaluation. At the end of the project, the main conclusion is that the OMNI MOUN is able to model the topology and traffic management infrastructures of any European city as demonstrated. No changes on the current architectures, infrastructures and devices have been necessary to use OMNI in four different sites. In addition to the configuration of the logical representation of the physical infrastructures, the only one requirement to use OMNI is to implement the necessary interfaces for making the different components OMNI compliant. These interfaces are small pieces of software to be implemented by the components providers. Guidelines to do this have been produced and successfully applied in each site. The approach used by the OMNI model allows to connect and inter-operate existing devices and applications by mean of developing software interfaces towards the model. At the same time the model provides for a system independent interface to expose data and functionalities to new applications (i.e. advanced control systems, information systems). The demonstration pilots have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. Based on COM technologies, the technological approach followed for the implementation of the OMNI model facilitates the adoption of standard communication protocols; independence from operating systems; high level of scalability, and a distributed architecture.",0,0

20,40721,Yes,Hypermedia for learning in the experimental sciences - potential uses and their merits,"Our aim is to design and evaluate learning situations offering a balanced articulation between specific aspects of experimental sciences, knowledge usually transferred by teachers in the classroom, and the flow of information provided by the media. The question arises how new technology, such as hypermedia, influence the mobilisation of learners' knowledge and the transfer to future problem solving situations. We will address this question through empirical study in the domain of modelling in physics. Analysing and comparing data obtained in essentially different learning situations will increase our scientific knowledge about learning with new technologies in complex situations and complex domains. Understanding how people use new technology and identifying the characteristics of situations in which learning takes place is crucial in today's information society. On more practical grounds, the learning situations developed in the context of the project will be used in the development and innovation of educational programmes.",1,1
172,209798,Yes,Exploring Gender in Children's Literature from Cognitive Corpus Stylistic Perspective,"Gender equality remains a critical societal challenge. But how does one ‘learn’ gender? Children’s literature presents one early source of cultural norms, values and assumptions about gender. Language use in these texts is a crucial means by which children learn about gendered concepts and behaviours. To understand this formative influence more deeply, the innovative GLARE project will examine the discursive construction of gender in corpora of English children’s literature drawing on a novel cognitive corpus stylistic approach to characterization to conceptualise the notion of gender. GLARE will further take a diachronic perspective to the development of gender representation over time. The ‘cognitive corpus stylistics’ links together corpus linguistics (CL) and Cognitive Poetics (CP). CL methods combine qualitative and quantitative approaches to text analysis while CP offers a theoretical framework to account for the creation of meaning in the mind of the reader. The approach adopted by GLARE stresses that the representation of real and fictional people is related – in terms of the background knowledge that readers bring to texts and in terms of the patterns used in a text. Hence, relationships between the representation of fictional characters and real people are to some extent a reflection of links between patterns in fictional and non-fictional texts. To investigate this relationship, the project draws on complementary data from the Times Digital Archive. Through the description and analysis of linguistic patterns GLARE will provide novel insights into the way in which children’s literature can influence the creation of gendered concepts and behaviours. GLARE will be situated at the University of Birmingham and supervised by Prof. Michaela Mahlberg, a world-leading expert in corpus stylistics. A secondment at Oxford University Press will allow the unique opportunity to access the largest electronic collection of children’s books, the Oxford Children’s Corpus.",1,1
466,209329,No,Maternal Obesity and Epigenetic Reprogramming: from Gametogenesis to Early Embryonic Development,"Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with major health consequences. One devastating consequence of obesity is ovarian failure and infertility in women.  Obesity causes endocrine dysfunction that compromises particularly the female gamete, the oocyte. Importantly, maternal obesity also affects the offspring, predisposing children to obesity and type 2 diabetes.  In the present proposal we will build on the unique expertise of the host lab and research experience of the postdoctoral fellow to address how maternal obesity promotes epigenetic changes in the oocyte and affects early embryonic development.  The proposal will exploit the synergies between two laboratories in a multidisciplinary research setting. The candidate has a background in reproductive medicine and endocrinology, with 5 years of postdoctoral experience over which the candidate has been producing a relevant body of preliminary data on obesity and ovarian failure.  The partner laboratory in Poland will contribute know-how and animal models for the study of obesity, as well as support from the local team. The host laboratory will provide methods and access to state-of-the-art facilities for epigenetic analysis.  Our results, will enable us to clearly understand: (i) the extent to which the oocyte is vulnerable to maternal obesity; (ii) if epigenetic changes established in the oocyte  interfere with early embryonic development. We will analyse the oocyte and early embryo epigenome and transcriptome of mouse strains with different susceptibilities to obesity and diet-induced obesity protocols representative of our social dietary habits.  We will critically assess the potential health consequences of maternal obesity for the offspring. Ultimately, the knowledge generated through this proposal will lead to the public sector being better informed and new political and pharmacological strategies can be conceived for the improvement of female fertility and prevention of disease in offspring.",0,0
732,31500,No,World class standards network,"This project will create a European Best Practice Network dedicated to stimulating the achievement of world class standards of business performance. It responds to the necessity of greatly improving the competitiveness of European businesses in the face of the rapidly changing contours of global competition. The main thrust of the project is to support the transformation of European businesses through provision and promotion of technologies for business processes evidence of world class practices and the creation of support networks. The position of European businesses in global markets is diminishing and the requirements of competitiveness have changed beyond all recognition.  The main aim of WORLD-CLASS-NET is to facilitate a step change in the capacities of European businesses to meet the opportunities and overcome the challenges of global competition. Key objectives of the project are to: 1. Establish a Europe wide network of best practice networks and Centres of Excellence 2. Engage over 7000 subscribers in the network of which at least 85% will be businesses 3. To accelerate the rate at which corporate subscribers transform their core processes   INTENDED APPROACH  To date, business process transformation and related dissemination initiatives in Europe have been fragmented and confusing and done little to speed up improvements in European business performance. It is from this standpoint that we propose to approach our work.   This project is an opportunity to establish and consolidate electronic communications, collaborations and actions involving various leading national networks and sources of expertise through the creation of ten Centres of Excellence based in existing organisations. These Centres, assisted by the specialist expertise of other project partners, will support a range of generic and bespoke services designed to enable European business leaders to efficiently source information, guidance, contacts and assistance relating to world class standards of performance and business process transformation. The project will utilise the full spectrum of communications channels and technologies including the World Wide Web, multimedia publishing formats, missions, training, special interest groups, printed materials, video-conferencing, groupware, conferences and workshops. This will enable it to provide appropriate access to subscribers and best practice projects from outside of the European Union as well as within.  EXPLOITATION OF RESULTS  Those partners in the project which are to act as host organisations for the ten Centres of Excellence are already engaging over 500 European businesses in the study and adoption of best practice and world class standards of performance. Each of the other partners has been selected for the knowledge and experience they have of the technologies for, promotion and management of business process transformation.  They all expect this project to result in an enduring range of services targeted on a bigger audience: senior executives, business leaders and their operational managers. By the end of the project, take-up of these services is expected to have yielded high returns on the investments each partner will have made in the project. Moreover, firm foundations for subscriber-based dedicated information and support services well beyond the two to three year life of the project will have been created.  The primary market for these services has already been quantified and tested by individual partners. It comprises the 200,000 or so larger businesses within the Union. Secondary markets are also very large - including medium sized companies, public authorities, voluntary organisations and other organisations beginning the long journey towards world beating excellence. Moreover, hardware and software vendors, consultancies, business schools, universities and colleges, employer organisations and government agencies will find benefits from the services envisaged.",1,0

799,42426,No,The governance of cross-border regional economic co-operation and the emergence of European cross-border regions - theory and empirical evidence,"Research objectives and content  Cross-border regions are a new form of subnational territorial unit, emerging in the context of European integration and globalisation. This project aims to undertake an original analysis of CBRs as spaces of indigenous economic development. Its primary objectives are: a) developing an appropriate conceptual apparatus; b) identifying the institutional conditions for and the obstacles to successful CBRs; c) generating policy-guidelines for cross-border endogenous development strategies. The elaboration of the theoretical approach is based on recent institutionalist theories which emphasise the importance of bottom-up governance mechanisms rather than top-down government. Since CBRs are not politico-administrative units, it is postulated that crossborder economic development is mainly based on governance leading to similar milieu innovateur-effects as shown for subnational regions. This will be demonstrated by several in-depth case studies on European CBRs including both successful and failed cases, which will provide guidelines for a bottom-up regional and innovation policy both at the European and cross-border regional levels.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  ? The project is directed towards a PhD degree and is accompanied by a recognised research training scheme.  ? Leading knowledge in institutional economics and economic sociology will be acquired as well as methodological skills for operationalising institutional processes for empirical research. ? General research competence will be enhanced through academic 'synergy effects' including working groups, informal contacts and opportunities for publications.

171,43340,Yes,Distance Education in Rural Areas via Libraries,"DERAL sets out to encourage public libraries to play an increasingly important part in transferring information, knowledge and education to users who have difficulty in following normal courses of study. This frequently applies to those living in rural areas as well as to the unemployed and to elderly or disabled people who cannot normally attend university, college or high school.  Guidelines will be drawn up for librarians and a set of tools based on Internet technology and video-conferencing will be developed allowing libraries to act as brokers between the providers of distance learning courses and users. The ultimate aim is to raise the level of education in rural areas and, by doing so, to help people to remain and work in their places of residence.  Technical approach  DERAL will provide a gateway to distance learning resources on the Web. Guidelines will be prepared for librarians and library users. Content to be delivered will include: multimedia learning resources geared to national curricula; self-training packages for core skills; networked encyclopaedic databases; specialist resources on topics for leisure and learning; e-mail; networked electronic journals; digitised collections of images, film, video and sound recordings; and public library catalogues in the five partnership countries and also in other countries (e.g. Library of Congress). Digital library resources will also be included. Service will include: support in accessing and searching global resources; guidance on the reliability of databases; access to and participation in special-interest Internet communities; access to specialist libraries and collections, and to virtual visits to exhibitions; information and guidance on educational and learning opportunities; interactive communications with educational institutions; access to local education authorities and information on finance for learning, grants, awards, etc; online application facilities; access to the library network and networked resources; and the relationship between all of these and access to the general facilities of a public library.  The work will require use of the two most powerful tools in distance education: the Internet and ISDN-based video-conferencing. If possible, TV-screen access to these resources will also be tested.  Key issues  In exploiting new technologies through the networked library, priority must be given to: enhancing education and lifelong-learning opportunities for children and adults; supporting training, employment and business, to foster economic prosperity; nurturing social cohesion through fostering a politically and culturally informed society.  The main results from the DERAL project will be guidelines for public librarians throughout Europe on support for library users wishing to participate in distance learning and related information searching.  Impact and expected results  The overall benefit will be that citizens in remote areas will have improved mediated access to distance learning resources via their public libraries. This will not only improve the quality of living in general but will assist in creating new jobs and new participation in the evolving information society.  DERAL will serve as a prototype in four, widely differing regions of Europe and, if successful, will become a model for Europe-wide access to distance learning through public libraries.",1,1
143,100795,Yes,Transcription and Translation of Video Lectures,"Online educational repositories of video lectures are rapidly growing on the basis of increasingly available and standardised infrastructure.  A well-known example of this is the VideoLectures web portal, a free and open access educational video lectures repository, and a major player in the development of the widely used Opencast Matterhorn platform for educational video management.  As in other repositories, transcription and translation of video lectures in VideoLectures is needed to make them accessible to speakers of different languages and to people with disabilities. However, also as in other repositories, most lectures in VideoLectures are neither transcribed nor translated because of the lack of efficient solutions to obtain them at a reasonable level of accuracy. The aim of transLectures is to develop innovative, cost-effective solutions to produce accurate transcriptions and translations in VideoLectures, with generality across other Matterhorn-related repositories. Our starting hypothesis is that there is only a relatively small gap for the current technology on automatic speech recognition and machine translation to achieve accurate enough results in the kind of audiovisual object collections we are considering. To close this gap, TL will follow two main research lines. First, we will study how to better deal with object variability by massive adaptation of general-purpose models from available lecture-specific knowledge. Second, as we think that accurate enough results are unlikely to be obtained with fully automatic methods alone, we will explore how to better reach the desired levels of accuracy by intelligent interaction with users.  On the other hand, it is our goal not end up with a system prototype that is only evaluated at the lab and can hardly be used in real-life settings. Instead, we will develop tools to work with Matterhorn, and thus we will be able to evaluate them in a real-life setting.",0,1

464,109286,No,Safe Life Extension management of aged infrastructures networks and industrial plants,"The importance of aging of infrastructures, networks and industrial plants will continue to increase because of (a) need to continue operation of these infrastructures, networks and plants beyond the design life-time, (b) need to operate under changed conditions and (c) the increased role of existing plants in the optimized (“smart”) supply and utility networks of the future, e.g. as fall-back supply. The effective agreed strategies to address aging issues are yet to be developed and consistently applied. The project, SafeLife-X, will contribute to creating consensus on aging management including potential cascading and/or ripple effects. It will, thus, satisfy the demand within various industrial sectors and help match the EU Grand Challenges and the EU-2020 Strategy, and achieve goals of main stakeholders (e.g. EC, OECD, ECTP, ETPIS…). The project will create a multi-disciplinary / multi-sector community able to answer the key issues related aging at EU & International level. The consortium includes members of the EU Technology Platforms ECTP (construction) and ETPIS (industrial safety) and a group of 25 experts to complement the expertise needed, and will be open to all interested parties. This community will meet, share experience and prepare a common vision for the future and main elements needed to realize it. The project will capitalize on best practices of modeling, asset integrity management, decision making, and cost-benefit analysis. CEN Workshop Agreement(s) will be initiated in the course of the project and the development of one European Standard (EN) on “Risk-Based Inspection Framework” pursued. New projects will propose input for Horizon 2020 within the Strategic Research Agenda & Roadmap.

86,90418,Yes,The Impact of Integration Policies on Immigrant Outcomes: Cross-country Evidence from EU,"The proposed research will study the impact of different integration policies in European context. The labor market outcomes of the first generation immigrants, the educational outcomes of the second generation and intergenerational mobility will be explored. The cross country variation in labor market outcomes of first generation immigrants is determined by two factors: (1) selection of immigrants that determines the set of observed and unobserved characteristics that immigrants bring to a host country, (2) integration that determines how a given set of characteristics are valued in the host country. This study is going to identify the impact of integration independent of selection effects using a natural experiment. This natural experiment is the mass recruitment of Turkish workers by European countries during 1960s and 1970s that dispersed individuals with similar characteristics across various countries. The second part of the project will provide evidence on the educational outcomes of second generation immigrants from the same source country. Using an internationally comparable data set of 15-year-old students the study will focus on the immigrant students’ performance in mathematics, reading, science and problem-solving skills and provide evidence on the cross country variation in their outcomes. Using the data on educational attainment of parents intergenerational linkages will be explored to assess the extent of upward mobility in these countries. Thus, this study will be exploring integration with a multi generational perspective and highlighting differences in outcomes across host countries for individuals with similar backgrounds. These results will inform the discussions about the best practices for integration both at EU and national levels.",1,1
582,220409,No,Specificity or generalization? Neural mechanisms for perceptual learning with variability,"The visual system is equipped with a powerful plasticity mechanism, perceptual learning, which serves to improve perception of consistent inputs. However, the signals it receives are extremely variable. How variability affects perceptual learning is unclear. Here, I ask how the visual system tackles the challenge of variability for learning: variability could impair perceptual learning, or, like in language and motor learning, result in the ability to generalize from trained to new materials. To create effective training programs, e.g., for clinical applications, it is crucial to know how to reap the benefits of variability, or, conversely, to overcome the challenges variability poses. Yet, the neural mechanisms by which the visual system copes with variability are unknown, hampering this endeavor. To close this gap, I propose a new theory, derived from the architecture of cortex: I hypothesize that perceptual learning is not limited to early visual areas, but flexibly occurs at a ‘sweet spot’ along the visual hierarchy whose functional properties match the variability in the given environment. To test this theory, I build on a multimodal, multispecies approach I have previously developed to study learning: I will identify general principles by which variability affects perceptual learning in behavior, dissect the critical neural circuits in macaque monkeys and humans with neuroimaging, determine the functional characteristics of neurons contributing to learning by electrophysiology, and establish their causal relevance using electrical stimulation. This unique combination of species and techniques is ideally suited to unravel the neural mechanism for coping with variability in perceptual learning. By elucidating the computations and mechanisms by which the visual system handles one of the most characteristic aspects of its inputs, I aim to provide the basis for neuroscience-based training paradigms that help alleviate vision deficits.",0,0
126,213248,Yes,MENTEE - Mastery learning in Europe through Technology Enhanced Education,"The proper education of our pupils is essential for the future of Europe, however, it is demonstrated that the current educational models are not meeting the expectations. How can we optimise and update these old-fashioned approaches to guarantee the best apprenticeship? We, InfoMentor, want to develop MENTEE, a unique web-based Mastery Learning platform fully tailored to the different National Curriculums (programmes of study) of EU countries. Thanks to its automated features, it will suppose a shift in the teaching profession that will reignite the passion of teachers and their students. We have detected two main problems in the EU educational systems: 1) Inefficient procedures, with paperwork drowning up to 50% of the teachers’ work time in bureaucracy; and 2) Summative assessment, an outdated assessment approach that causes between 17%-20% of young people falling below the minimum standard in key subjects ranges. In order to break this cycle, we have created MENTEE, an educational platform that enables: 1) Efficiency, by reducing by 50% the efforts of teachers allocated to administrative and planning tasks; and 2) Enhanced assessment, by promoting the educational mastery through formative assessment (where students’ progress is continuously monitored through automated, education-tailored tools) and mastering learning (which requires students to fully master an assignment before moving on to the next one). Our business opportunity is promising; the Education market is a €4,700 billion global industry (estimated growth of 10% from 2015 to 2019) and it is only 2% digitised, with a huge gap between technology availability and actual implementation in schools (textbooks still are the main resource for pupils learning how to read), supposing a huge potential for digital solutions like MENTEE. Thanks to this project, we estimate additional cumulative cash flow of €7.4 million by the third year of commercialisation and the creation of 16 to 20 new jobs.",1,1
944,104916,No,"Neighbourhood choice, neighbourhood sorting, and neighbourhood effects","There is a strong belief among academics and policy makers that living in deprived neighbourhoods has a negative effect on residents’ life chances over and above the effect of their individual characteristics: so-called neighbourhood effects. The concept of neighbourhood effects – as an independent residential and social environment effect on individual outcomes – is academically intriguing, but has also been embraced by policy makers, mainly in connection with unemployment and a lack of social mobility. The neighbourhood effects discourse has had a major impact on urban and neighbourhood policies and has influenced governments to spend large sums of money on area based policies. A small but growing critical literature, questions the evidence base of neighbourhood effects. Although it is likely that neighbourhood effects exist, we do not know enough about the causal mechanisms which produce them, their relative importance compared to individual characteristics such as education, and under which circumstances and where these effects are important. This interdisciplinary and international proposal argues that in order to further our understanding of neighbourhood effects, and to provide a solid and sophisticated evidence base for policies aimed at deconcentrating poverty, we should investigate the effects of selection mechanisms into and out of neighbourhoods. NBHCHOICE has three objectives 1) to further develop the theoretical framework linking neighbourhood choice and neighbourhood effects 2) to empirically investigate neighbourhood choice over the life course, and 3) to integrate models of neighbourhood choice with models of neighbourhood effects. The project will use large longitudinal datasets from The Netherlands, UK and Sweden and will bring together researchers from various countries. NBHCHOICE will contribute to the development of theory, to more targeted and effective policy measures, to the career development of the applicant, and to the host institute.",0,0
287,41427,No,Scanning chemical microscope,"Since the discovery of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (S.T.M.), many other Microscopes were developed to probe surfaces. All these microscopes are based on different interactions between tip and surfaces. If apparatus such as Atomic Force Microscope (A.F.M.) Allows the investigation of surfaces, giving information on frictional properties, topographic aspects for example, it would be interesting to further develop the Scanning Probe Microscope (S.P.M.) towards the Scanning Chemical Microscope (S C.M.). An effort of this kind is justified since now science becomes more and more interested in the nanomanipulation and the observation of chemical and physical phenomena at the macromolecular and atomic scales such as synthetic and natural polymers. Because of their non-conducting properties, Scanning Tunnelling Microscope can't be used to probe these surfaces. And if Atomic Force Microscope is more suitable for these kind of samples, it doesn't give any information on chemical nature or functionality of the molecular groups and atoms. To obtain chemical recognition we must put a specific interaction, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, between the tip and the substract. Therefore the subject proposed consist to modified tips, used in Atomic Force Microscopy, according to different synthetic strategies based on the use of Self Assembling Monolayers (SAMs), to obtain the chemical picture of the surface, and by the way to develop a new kind of apparatus: The Scanning Chemical Microscope.

The aim is to enhance the European research capacity on Chinese society, Chinese politics and modern and contemporary Chinese history by training postgraduate research students from Europe in relevant research approaches and techniques.  Although each participating university does provide good generic research training for its postgraduate students, the number of research students in each institution doing research on China is relatively small; a series of research training seminars will allow critical mass and a concentration of training expertise not normally available in any European university.

Work has been carried out on the development of a dedicated front end, for both teacher and student, for a distributed virtual classroom. Also, 6 pilot experiments have been conducted on the use of video conferencing for language training. It is planned to hold video-conferences for various training groups.   The proposed DELTA experimentation builds upon a series of experiments and their outcome with 'Learning through Video-Conferences' conducted already in 1987 and 1988. The results of those tests showed that new communication systems combining video, audio communication and information processing techniques can be an excellent medium for remote teaching if the system design adequately takes into account the specific needs of learners and the teacher.   In this project we like to find answer to following questions:   a) Which kinds of interaction between teacher and student are actually used; which kinds of interaction would be desirable from the students' and the teacher's point of view? b) Which kinds of pedagogical methods are compatible with today's hardware and software? c) Which improvements in hardware and software are necessary from the teacher's point of view? d) What kind of transmission of on-the-spot material is possible, what is the quality of the transmission? Is it possible to show objects on the screen?   The project has an explorative character and precedes the corresponding experiments of the DELTA pilot phase.

177,227523,Yes,Bringing Cognitive Linguistics and Language Teaching Closer Together,"Linguistic research and foreign language teaching have been drifting apart from each other. At a time of declining social cohesion in polyglot Europe, scientifically sound and effective foreign language teaching is vital for mutual understanding, in particular, teaching of German, which will likely gain in importance as European lingua franca. CLOSER attempts to bring foreign language research and teaching closer together. Adopting quantitative research methods from usage-based cognitive linguistics, I investigate the acquisition of German two-way prepositions (2WYP), which poses significant challenges to foreign language learners. I use regression modeling and large data samples to pin down the factors which determine native choices and nonnative errors in authentic language use. Based on the findings, I develop a semi-artificial grammar learning experiment which provides insight into the interplay of input-driven implicit practice and metalinguistic explicit knowledge, which is crucial and unique to foreign language learning but widely unexplored in usage-based research. CLOSER is unique and original in supplying quantitative evidence to the ongoing linguistic debate about  2WYP. In unprecedented ways, CLOSER looks at the intricate interplay of forces at the implicit-explicit learning interface to bridge the gap to instructed foreign language teaching. Needless to say, however, research findings do not straightforwardly extend to instructed learning in classroom settings. Therefore, I develop online applications which generate teaching materials for optimized construction learning based on prototypical usage contexts and effective metalinguistic instructions.

923,209165,No,Pharmacological safety testing in human adult stem cell-derived organoids,"Toxicology and pharmacology assays are crucial pillars of modern drug development. They are essential to understand how tissues such as intestine and liver take up and degrade pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the lack of suitable in vitro systems, these assays are carried out in experimental animals. This practice increases cost and development time but also creates significant ethical issues.   We recently developed a 3D culture system that allows us to expand human tissue stem cells from intestine and liver as organoids and differentiate them to the respective functional adult tissue in vitro. These stem cell-derived tissues show high cytochrome activity and are able to metabolize drugs in a simple and cost-effective in vitro assay. With support from the ERC Proof of concept grant we aim to prove that our technology can outperform current in vitro systems and replace a significant portion of animal-based toxicology studies. This technological advance will lead to substantial reduction of cost in industrial and academic drug development and overcome practical and ethical pitfalls in animal-based testing.  To this end we will develop an organoid-based assay to test tissue-drug interactions in three steps:  1)  Definition of optimal parameters for human in vitro assays to assess gastro-intestinal and hepatic toxicity  2)  Scale-up 3)  Technology transfer and commercial distribution",0,0

It has the potential for applications to a wide range of fields, including aerospace, chemical processing, transportation systems and resource economics.  The multi-partner initial training network SADCO aims at: Training young researchers and future scientific leaders in the field of control theory with emphasis on two major themes sensitivity of  optimal strategies to changes in the model specifications, and deterministic controller design; Advancing the theory and developing new numerical methods; Conveying fundamental scientific contributions within European industrial sectors.  In order to achieve  these objectives, SADCO establishes a collaborative research and training network of eleven full partners from both the academic and industrial sectors, and gathers participants with expertise in complementary disciplines in mathematics and engineering. The network also offers a complete range of theoretical, practical and complementary training. SADCO will work together with the young researchers to develop and implement effective training plans tailored to each individual requirements. Multi-disciplinary training based on the integrated scientific programme, secondements, regular meetings, active networking,  will ensure  the success of this project.  The development of new 'clean' technologies in power,  transportation and other domains is a major opportunity for EU industries.

512,63830,No,Sixth Carolus Magnus Euro summer school on plasma and fusion energy physics,"The research field of controlled thermonuclear fusion of light atomic nuclei is at the advent of a crucial event: in a few years time, the construction, possibly in Cadarache (France), of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will start. This tokamak will either demonstrate man's capabilities to harness energy released from fusion reactions and the economical potential to rely on this process for future energy production or it will prove that another base-load and environmentally acceptable method of energy production will have to be identified and developed to satisfy society's energy needs once, a few decades from now, fossil fuels will be depleted. ITER 's success will non-negligibly depend on European scientists.  Facing this challenge requires preparing the future by optimally bundling present-day expertise and passing it on to the next generation of young researchers. Ample possibilities exist to acquire experimental experience on one of Europe's fusion machines. Because of the extensiveness of the physics and technological areas involved, universities cannot take up the task of lecturing extensively on these rather specialised topics, although basic courses on plasma theory are taught at various European universities. Courses on a high level covering both basic and advanced concepts are required to complement experimental training. The Carolus Magnus summer schools fill up this niche. Through its lecturers, it provides a deep physics insight both from the theoretical (starting from first principles) as well as from the experimental point of view. The school primarily aims at young researchers working towards a Ph.D. in the fusion field and has the ambition to give a wide but sufficiently deep overview of the various aspects involved in magnetic confinement fusion (equilibrium and instabilities, confinement and heating, plasma-wall interaction, diagnostics), side glancing at related topics such as inertial fusion and environmental issues.  The summer school is organised every 2 years by the Trilateral Euregio Cluster (TEC) consisting of the Laboratory for Plasma Physics (Brussels, Belgium), the Institut fiir Plasmaphysik (Jülich, Germany) and the FOM-Institute 'Rijnhuizen' (The Netherlands), three teams collaborating intensively on the TEXTOR tokamak in Jülich.",0,0

136,100488,Yes,"Children of Prisoners, Interventions & Mitigations to Strengthen Mental Health","COPING presents a child-centred research strategy covering four European countries, the UK, Germany, Romania and Sweden, which will identify the characteristics of children with imprisoned parents, their resilience, and their vulnerability to mental health problems. This group of children are exposed to triple jeopardy through break-up of the family, financial hardship, and extremes of stigma and secrecy, leading to adverse social and educational repercussions. None of the four countries so far recognises the extreme disadvantage experienced by these young people. Support available, for example, in accessing prisons and participating in prison visits is extremely variable and mainly provided through non-governmental organisations. Support for imprisoned parents, whose moral authority is diminished through their incarceration, is equally inconsistent. The COPING research strategy places the clearest emphasis on knowledge obtained directly from children and young people. The project will commission surveys of 200 children in each country aged 11-16 with an imprisoned parent, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, to ascertain coping strategies and mental health problems for these young people, which will be compared with normative population samples. Smaller groups of children and parents will be involved in in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the impact of parental imprisonment and support services available in greater detail. Interventions to support these families will be comprehensively mapped. Children will play a prominent role in disseminating research results to policy makers and professional bodies Impacts of the COPING research will include improvements in information about this group of children; step changes in Government and public awareness about their plight; potential new legislation; and improvements in prison regimes to enable effective contact and visits for children to imprisoned",1,1

558,99503,No,Development of novel bactericidal dental bioactive composites for prosthetic restorations,"Secondary caries and cement dissolution represent two of the most common reasons of fixed prosthetic restorations failure which are caused by the marginal gap that exists between tooth and restoration, which is open to oral bacteria. The significant research objective of the present research is the prolongation of the lifetime of fixed ceramic restorations, which should be achieved by eliminating secondary caries, avoiding micropenetration of oral bacteria and by supporting healthy periodontal regeneration. To achieve this objective, the proposed research project will develop and introduce in dental clinical practice a new family of composite bioactive materials with antibacterial properties. The planed research work consists of three main tasks: a) development of two different processing protocols (incorporation of silver particles, sol-gel preparation method) for fabricating new bioactive Ag-doped silicate composite materials, b) complete characterization of microstructural properties, antibacterial effects and biological behavior of the newly developed products and c) establishment of the optimum implementation approach for the new dental composites in a clinical setting. With successful completion of the project, new dental materials will be available which are capable of creating a bacterial free environment with the marginal area being kept sealed through the healthy periodontal attachment to the biomaterial, intentionally placed in contact to periodontal ligament. The implementation of the project provides an innovative and interdisciplinary scientific and technological concept. The project results are expected to complement related themes of the FP7 research agenda, with particular impact on the fields; dental health, materials science, microbiology and cell biology. An additional impact will be the professional integration of the applicant to a European university, strengthening quantitatively and qualitatively the human potential in research in Europe.",0,0
794,2760,No,THE CHARACTERIZATION AND DETERMINATION OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE FROM DECOMMISSIONING,"The objective of this laboratory-scale experimental investigation is to develop the 'fingerprint' method for the characterization of waste arising from decommissioning projects to the point where it could be used more extensively after its initial limited application.   The 'fingerprint' method relies on the ability to carry out comprehensive analysis, for all of a specified range of radionuclides on a statistically justified set of samples. In order to achieve this, development of several aspects, related particularly to the difficulty of measuring some specific electron capture and low energy beta-emitting nuclides, is required.   It is expected that the establishment of accurate fingerprints, when coupled with simple measurement of the total activity, will enable correct sentencing of waste and thus minimize the cost of the disposal of the waste arising from the decommissioning of radiochemical laboratories or reactor facilities.   Collaboration is envisaged with TUV Sudwest, FRG (contract No. FI2D0033), both on the development of radiochemical methods and on the assessment of measurement techniques. The objective of this laboratory scale experimental investigation is to develop the fingerprint method for the characterisation of waste arising from decommissioning projects to the point where it could be used more extensively after its initial limited application.

307,18750,No,Common Training Architecture,"Purpose   Within DELTA, CTA belongs to the set of 200-series or System and Technology projects:    its aim is to contribute to the harmonization of the technologies which underlie learning.   It therefore reaches across the other 200-series projects to explore the ways in which their results may be integrated with one another, and with other relevant technologies being standardized elsewhere.   Background and Rationale   From its inception, the CTA has been understood as a central plank in the overall strategy of the DELTA programme. It relates to one of the main objectives of DELTA:   'To harmonize technologies, systems and infrastructures, and their adaptation to optimally convey learning services Europe-wide.'   In the context of the CTA this objective is interpreted as implying not just the harmonization of existing technologies, systems and infrastructures, but also a long-term view of the requirements of the key players and the identification of a framework for future work in this area.   The Project is motivated by the recognition that technology-supported learning of the 1980's has been characterised by fragmentation - 'islands of implementation' representing a diversity of approaches to course development and presentation, as well as the technological basis of production, delivery and support.  While diversity is expected, and is in many ways a positive feature, of a developing field, it also has considerable negative effects. The inability to benefit from the economies of scale keeps costs high for both providers and learners. This, in turn, reduces access by learners to opportunities created by distance- and open learning, which in turn leads to slow market development, thus completing a vicious circle of slow, fragmented growth.   Therefore, the CTA Project is broad in its conception ranging over also some of the other goals of the DELTA Programme, which include:    improving the access to and the performance of learning services in Europe,   improving the market competitiveness of the training industry.   Overall, the CTA Project, like DELTA itself aims to foster the development of Advanced Learning Technology in Europe in order to meet the growing training needs of a rapidly changing world in which there is an ever increasing demand for a more highly skilled workforce and hence retraining programmes to keep step with technological change.    The CTA will provide both a forum for establishing standards within the DELTA community (i.e. DELTA standards), and a channel between this particular standards forum and the wider context of existing and emerging de facto and de-jure standards outside DELTA, upon which DELTA standards will be built.  The CTA Handbook, consisting of 11 volumes, has been produced. The Management Summary is aimed at senior decision makers who wish to gain an overview of the relevance of the CTA. The CTA Overview plus Annex is aimed at learning professionals interested in the CTA, and the Open Communication Interface plus Annex is aimed at telematics implementors. The Common Information Space plus Annex is aimed at database implementors whereas the Common User Interface plus Annex is aimed at user interface experts. The CTA Scenarios and ELT Framework, plus Annexes, are aimed at learning professionals who wish to use the Common Training Architecture. Approach   The project is conceived along lines similar to the process of standards development, namely:   1. development of common understanding and terminology  2. development of common frameworks  3. specification of functional requirements  4. exploration of technical options and development of standards profiles  5. development of validation and conformance testing methods  6. dissemination of results.   The starting point for the work is the identification of the scope of advanced learning technologies, in terms of practical scenarios. On the basis of these scenarios, a system architecture (the Common Training Architecture) will be developed. An architecture is defined as a framework of functional components, embracing a set of standards, conventions, rules, and processes (in which there is human involvement). All of these have to support the integration of a wide range of (information technology based) products and services, enabling them to be used effectively.   Once in place, the scenarios and the architecture will provide the basis of the more detailed specification of requirements, to be undertaken by each of the parallel work packages dealing with the Open Communication Interface (OCI), Multi-media databases, and the Common User Interface (CUI), respectively.   Output   The main contributions of the Project will be:    to propose a framework which is descriptive of the technology-supported training systems currently in use or proposed for the near future (the 'Common Training Architecture')   to define within this framework the interfaces where standards can be applied   to research, collate and where necessary propose a set of standards profiles and options in the context of the Common Training Architecture   to develop the architecture, the standards profiles and options in close cooperation with other DELTA projects and present its conclusions to the DELTA community for validation and endorsement   to seek the endorsement of its recommendations among the wider educational and training community   following these endorsements, to seek to influence the relevant standards bodies in respect of the recommendations.    During the course of the project, workshops will be organized and progress reports will be made at DELTA Consultation Meetings, and written summaries distributed through the activities of horizontal projects involved in DELTA dissemination.   Outside the DELTA Community, dissemination is expected to take place through:    the T3RT project, to the education and training industry at large   links with working groups of formal standardisation bodies.   The ultimate means of dissemination, however, will be the CTA Handbook. This will contain output from the Project at all stages:    Scenarios where harmonisation issues will become apparent   Specified requirements which the CTA work addresses   Recommended technical solutions in the form of standards profiles   Validation procedures for each of the recommended set of technical solutions.   Impact   The main reason for standardization is the existence of a wide range of products and services in the market place which are available as separate entities but need to work together in specific applications. Unless the individual components of, say, a technology-based training system can work together harmoniously the training objective will be reached only partially, if at all.   In addition, standardization aims to define and ensure performance and quality attributes of products and systems, safety and reliability features, as well as clear methods of testing and measuring these attributes and features. Effective standards which have gained wide acceptance can reduce uncertainties, eg interrelation to purchasing decisions, and in this way encourage the development of a market place. This, in turn, will stimulate the entry of new producers and system providers into the market and so increase the choice available to users. The CTA Project is, therefore, directed towards all aspects of the market sector in which the technologies which underlie flexible and distance learning are employed. Its success will be measured by the extent to which its recommendations are validated and accepted by the DELTA Community.",0,0
451,51934,No,Dedicated electronic noses for enhanced performance of medium/large size air conditioning systems ('CLEANAIR'),"Objectives: The attention towards the problems connected with the management of HVAC systems either in terms of IAQ or energy consumption has become more and more pronounced. The consciousness that the highlighted problems cannot be solved with the present available approaches has brought the CLEAN-AIR consortium to propose innovative solutions and new operating concepts. The objectives of CLEAN-AIR proposal can be summarized in: a) the development of a number of devices miniaturized in silicon (sensors, pre-combustion unit, gas separation column), whose ultimate performances can be improved by the miniaturization and by the integration on a common micro-fluidic platform; b) a drastic improvement of the indoor/outdoor air quality status knowledge through the development of dedicated, miniaturized, low cost electronic noses realized using state-of-the-art microsystems/sensors fabrication technologies; c) energy consumption reduction while insuring comfortable working/living places operating the HVAC facility taking into account ì) the indoor/outdoor air quality status and ii) operating the HVAC under demand and not on the base of a defined duty cycle. Scientific and technological achievements. During the project duration the major achievements obtained are: 1. Accurate definition of the system specification and identification of set of gas compounds to be monitored for keeping trace of the air quality: For the indoor and outdoor air quality, IAQ & OAQ, current standard definitions along with the minimum and maximum pollutant concentrations have been reviewed and, whenever possible, improved; 2. Sensing material development and optimisation: The definition of a standard for IAQ & OAQ has allowed to better targeting the development of the sensing material (sensitivity, selectivity, minimum detectable concentration, etc). NO2 and CO concentrations well below the target values (100 ppb and 10 ppm, respectively) are currently detected and measured having enough sensitivity, selectivity and stability to ensure sensor operation longer than 6 months. To better diversify the sensor response, different sensor-operating modes were deeply investigated. This was made possible being the sensing element integrated in a low-power consumption micro machined substrate heater elements developed within this project. This activity leads to the disclosure of optimal operating conditions for the detection of the different compounds. Several difficulties were encountered trying to keep stable the sensor response to very low VOC concentrations, which were well detected by brand new sensors. However, the drift of the VOC sensors is still too high to allow a reliable usage in open air, as those for CO and NO2. Therefore, within the CA project, it was decided that the detection of NO2 and CO would be implemented with sensors in open air with a suitable set of math algorithms for pattern recognition. In parallel, for the detection of VOC a pneumatic motherboard integrating the GCC has been designed and fabricated. 3. Accurate definition of the operating condition for the detection of NO2 and CO down to very low concentrations in a test system simulating real world. The work carried out in this field has brought to the identification of optimised operating parameters for the sensors dedicated to the detection of these pollutants. Furthermore, the extended test performed has provided a significant amount of data for the development of the mathematical algorithms necessary to evaluate the concentration of the different pollutants present in the air. 4. Definition of the operating conditions for the detection of VOC using a gas-chromatographic approach. This activity became necessary since we observed a significant degradation of the sensors developed for this class of substances, which could not be overcome simply improving the performances of the sensors. However, operating these sensors together with a gas chromatographic column miniaturized in silicon under suitable operating conditions, sub-ppm concentrations of VOC were detected. 5. Development of a packed gas chromatographic column integrated in silicon to increase the selectivity of the sensors towards certain compounds, by separating them in time. The realization of these devices has brought to extended activities aiming to identify the suitable materials for the realization of the column, the suitable fabrication process, the suitable active phase to be used all together with metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors and the suitable operating conditions. In particular, to create circular shaped structures in silicon, necessary for the fabrication of the GCC device, a modified ASE process was developed at IMSAS. The spiral shaped column allows higher packaging than it can be obtained with a meander shaped configuration. Furthermore, an ad-hoc wafer bonding technique suitable to seal with a Pyrex wafer the column realized in silicon has been developed. All these information were used for the realization of the first prototypes of columns integrated in silicon. The test performed highlighted the possibility to detect and identify very low concentrations of VOC, down to few ppb in any gas mixture. 6. Development of a miniaturized pneumatic motherboard suitable to lodge the devices realized using a micro system approach and capable to perform specific tasks needed to detect the target gas species. This activity has brought to specific investigations aiming to identify those materials compatible with the application, innovative solutions for micro fluidic and electrical interconnectivity and for the packaging. 7. Development of suitable pattern recognition math algorithms, based on PCA/PLS, Fuzzy logic and peak detection approach, to evaluate the concentration of the different pollutants in the gas mixture. In spite of the effort done to increase the discrimination capabilities of the gas sensors developed within the project, metal oxide based devices needs post-signal treatments to identify and evaluate the different compounds in the gas mixture. The tools developed within the project have shown their capability to discriminate and to evaluate the concentration of CO and NO2 in air from the signal out from thin film gas sensors operated under suitable conditions. Furthermore, specific tools capable to identify and evaluate VOC out from a miniaturized gas chromatographic column detected with a thin film gas sensor were developed. 8. Development of a driving electronic prototype based on a microprocessor to control the EN. The main task of this electronics is to convert the chemical information coming from the sensors into usable output exchangeable with the air-conditioning management system. This task include the control of all the fluidic and selectivity functionality's within the EN, that is the control of the operating parameters of the sensors, the control of valves, gas chromatographic column and pre-combustion unit if needed. Finally, the µP systems perform an accurate measurement of the resistance change exhibited by the chemical sensor as well as data logging and data conversion communication toward the air-conditioning management system. 9. Development of a miniaturized analytical tool - electronic nose - to detect and monitor indoor and outdoor pollutant species (NO2, CO and VOC) realized with a micro systemic approach bringing together the different units (hardware and software) described so far. The test of the preliminary prototypes is in progress. 10. Development of the driving unit (hardware and software) for the heating venting air condition systems suitable to integrate a tool for air quality monitoring and to undertake specific actions on the basis of the information coming from the different electronic noses installed. Results and exploitation plans:  Based on the planned activities and on the results obtained so far, several objectives of the Clean Air project were fulfilled and the proposed approach has been validated under controlled laboratory conditions. Despite those encouraging results, an important delay has been accumulated in several tasks. In particular, some devices were available only at the very last period of the project and the characterization of GCC, PCU and PMB prototypes was preliminary or it has been carried out on a subsystem of the final EN micro system, only. For these reasons, the in-field validation of the EN, the test of the final prototype together with the HVAC systems and the achievement of the objectives were not possible in the timeframe project. However, the collaboration between the partners is still ongoing because of the common interest in the exploitation of the results from both the scientific and the commercial point of view. In this view, an extension of the project duration would be necessary to fully accomplish the requirement of the project.",0,0

New forms of governance are sought, in particular in rural areas with intensive agricultural irrigation where authorities lack the means to regulate large numbers of dispersed users. During the Fellowship, I will develop new understanding of strategies and institutional arrangements for increasing the resilience of groundwater dependent rural economies, and develop and test a methodology that support local actors to design collective solutions. Overall, the Fellowship aims to: (1) carry out a global assessment of strategies and institutions currently used worldwide; (2) develop a participatory foresight methodology to support the design of innovative strategies and institutional arrangements in two case studies; and (3) promote academic exchange and disseminate research. The Fellowship will enable me to strengthen my empirical and theoretical knowledge of the design of institutions for common-pool resource management and natural resource management, and position me as a leading scholar in the competitive research community on environmental and institutional economics.

637,92527,No,From Sea to Etna with European Researchers,"The role of researchers is very important for the growth of European Union’s competitiveness and for the well being of society. However, the work they do is still not sufficiently known and the stereotyped image of researchers as people detached from reality and thoroughly concentrated in their activity, in some cases, still exists. The main objective of the SEER project consists of bringing researchers closer to people and making citizens understand that their work is very important for their daily life.  The SEER proposal is managed by Catania University in cooperation with all scientific and research organisations active in the city. As such, it is expected to reach a large audience. People participating in the Night of Researchers should become aware of what researchers do and understand that they are “ordinary” people with the same hobbies, dreams and amusements as everyone.  During the event, numerous both amusing and interesting activities will be carried out with the active involvement of researchers, who will let people discover the world of researchers and science and in such way contribute to encourage children and young people to consider a future scientific career. The Night of Researchers will not only create a bridge between researchers and people but also contribute to eliminate the stereotyped idea of the researcher. Moreover, the support of European Union and the simultaneous organisation of the Researchers’ Night on September 26th in all participating countries (except in Israel) will give great emphasis to the event.

397,101583,No,Action research: Improving understanding and methodologies in early development,"The ACT Initial Training Network aims to establish a leading European training network devoted to investigating the interplay between action and cognition using a developmental approach. The ACT network represents a collective of scientific and industrial groups at the cutting edge of research in the fields of social development, developmental psychology, cognitive science, developmental neuropsychology, and computational science. The network will train PhD students and produce new technology to answer critical issues in our understanding of human development. A core assumption of the network is that development of perception, motivation, and cognition is grounded in, and develops through, our own actions (von Hofsten, 2004). We learn about our physical environment by actively engaging with the world. As we develop new action capabilities, new elements of the environment become salient to us. This process is especially prominent early in infancy when action capacities and an understanding of the world develop. The nature of developmental research demands a multi-method approach. As a result, we propose to rigorously train ESRs such that they obtain two or more techniques required to study the relationship between brain and behaviour in early social development.   We will conduct research and training within and between academic and industry partners on the role of attention in action, prospective control, social interactions, and semantics in action.  We will improve technologies so that movement analysis is possible with infants. We will also develop an eye tracking system that links to EEG and we will create tools that are designed specifically for infant EEG data. In addition to these major breakthroughs in our knowledge, we will provide a structured training programme for Early Stage Researchers that capitalizes on cross-European strengths that will produce cutting edge leaders within the field in a unique and timely interdisciplinary training programme.",0,0
713,52190,No,"Extending the European archaeology web over Bulgaria, Romania and Poland","The networking and internationalisation of existing academic resources,historical and cultural achievements, as well as the research efforts of the academic community in the field of Archaeology using computer, information and communication technologies is a recent trend with a rapidly growing impact on archaeological research, management and education. In recent years, Internet services have completely changed the way scientists work: e-mail, usenet, FTP and finally WWW architecture now allow scientists to collaborate on distributed resources, e.g. databases and exhibitions over the WWW. Although the countries of Eastern Europe have an important place in the historical and cultural development of Europe, they do not currently have substantial participation in this process of intensifying information exchange, due to their past closedness and current economic problems. There is thus the spectre of an ever widening 'information gap' between the affluent countries of north-western Europe and those countries struggling at the margins. ArchTerra aims to help redress the current imbalances in access to European networking facilities for professional archaeologists from Bulgaria, Romania and Poland, and to provide the impetus for an active expansion of archaeological Internet communication and information services both within CEC and between EU and CEC. The project is implemented as a research network bringing together computer scientists and archaeologists from five EU countries (the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany) and three CEC (Bulgaria, Romania and Poland), and encompasses tasks and objectives in four areas:  · technical installation (computer hardware and software, networking infrastructure) · transfer of expertise (technical workshops, extended visits, discussion lists) · creation of new content (WWW database and exhibition) and tools for the management of that content · dissemination (international conference, printed guides, WWW hosts)  The ArchTerra workplan assumes a runtime of 2 years and consists of 6 work packages subdivided into 18 tasks and organised in a goal driven workflow which fully exploits the complementary nature of the partners' expertise. The project is controlled through a series of meetings and workshops intended to review tasks and deliverables, monitor progress and resolve technical problems.  ArchTerra will establish and/or expand local networks at the partnering organisations in Bulgaria, Romania and Poland. Several popular Internet services will be started and/or extended, new free software products will be developed in order to connect catalogues of archaeological museums to the Internet using the modern Internet/Intranet technologies, many of the actual holdings will be digitised and put into an electronic form to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting research in a supra-national field from multiple distributed workplaces. In the course of these activities the project furthers professional development of the CEC researchers during study visits to western partners, technical workshops, and an international conference.  Although targeted mainly at safeguarding the scientific potential and inclusion of the CEC academic community in the European context of the emerging Global Information Society, ArchTerra is expected also to produce some technical solutions of wider significance to the problems associated with international scientific collaboration, specifically: · how to implement multilingual interfaces to dynamically generated hypertext databases, and · how to provide meaningful access to museum catalogues over the WWW, generated as hypertext interface to relational databases. While the former addresses the problem of making information accessible, the latter will demonstrate to the international scientific community and to the general public alike the treasures that currently remain hidden in museums across eastern Europe, and which are highly relevant to our common past.  ArchTerra will therefore achieve, in addition to a direct improvement in the availability of archaeological information and means of communication within the partnering CEC, a lasting impact on the public and scientific perception of archaeology as shared heritage and as a non-renewable resource across Europe.",0,0

777,206831,No,ABI telerehabilitation system with high impact in patient’s wellbeing at limited cost,"Curative and rehabilitative care have become a real challenge for developed countries, as they already account for more than 50% of the total healthcare expenditure. Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), the leading cause of death and permanent disability worldwide, represent the main component of these costs, and their prevalence is also growing at great rates. Due to the ABI´s patient chronic condition, the only way to lessening effects or slowing down their disorder is following strict rehabilitation therapies. However, the current rehabilitation model presents a major shortcoming: Lack of impact on patient’s wellbeing at great healthcare cost. In addition, the potential of using telemedicine as an alternative is being hindered by the reduced participation of the clinical community, which turns into solutions that do not address the real ABI patient needs for an effective treatment, such as therapies that combine motor ability, cognition and sensory capacity.  After 5 years of research at The Institute of Functional Rehabilitation (IRF) of La Salle University, we have developed integral exercises for the telerehabilitation of ABI, to be practiced at home, to train ADL as well as Activities at Work, compiled into a modular platform called MTT. MTT covers the need to provide cost-efficient, incentive and effective ABI rehabilitation by taking proper advantage of ICT in order to allow taking therapy to ADL, and training all related core functions (motor, cognitive and sensory) simultaneously.  MTT operates within the market of Virtual Reality and Telerehabilitation technologies that are experiencing a stunning high growth: CAGR of 19% and 76%, respectively. At the end of SME-Phase 1, we will elaborate a detailed Business Innovation Plan to make us ready for Phase 2 and market uptake following these main objectives: Market study and Validation activities, Deeply study of relevant regulation, monitoring a very dynamic market and IPR integral strategy.",0,0

674,110771,No,Embodied Audition for RobotS,"The success of future natural intuitive human-robot interaction (HRI) will critically depend on how responsive the robot will be to all forms of human expressions and how well it will be aware of its environment. With acoustic signals distinctively characterizing physical environments and speech being the most effective means of communication among humans, truly humanoid robots must be able to fully extract the rich auditory information from their environment and to use voice communication as much as humans do. While vision-based HRI is well developed, current limitations in robot audition do not allow for such an effective, natural acoustic human-robot communication in real-world environments, mainly because of the severe degradation of the desired acoustic signals due to noise, interference and reverberation when captured by the robot's microphones. To overcome these limitations, EARS will provide intelligent 'ears' with close-to-human auditory capabilities and use it for HRI in complex real-world environments. Novel microphone arrays and powerful signal processing algorithms shall be able to localise and track multiple sound sources of interest and to extract and recognize the desired signals. After fusion with robot vision, embodied robot cognition will then derive HRI actions and knowledge on the entire scenario, and feed this back to the acoustic interface for further auditory scene analysis. As a prototypical application, EARS will consider a welcoming robot in a hotel lobby offering all the above challenges. Representing a large class of generic applications, this scenario is of key interest to industry and, thus, a leading European robot manufacturer will integrate EARS's results into a robot platform for the consumer market and validate it. In addition, the provision of open-source software and an advisory board with key players from the relevant robot industry should help to make EARS a turnkey project for promoting audition in the robotics world.",0,0

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), medical services, people at home and the universities themselves will be able to access learning provision based on advanced information technology and master its potential. Courses in automated manufacturing to open up new markets for SMEs, multimedia courses for doctors, and computerized self-testing of knowledge by students will be typical initial applications.    ELECTRA is an acronym for 'Electronic Learning Environment for Continual Training and Research in the ALMA universities' (the universities of Aachen, Liege, Maastricht and Diepenbeek-Hasselt).   It is a concerted effort by the four ALMA universities in three countries (Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium), working closely with local trade and industry representatives to realise a sophisticated electronic learning environment, a 'microcosm', on which a spectrum of (multi-lingual) telematic applications and services will become accessible. The word microcosm refers to the variety of educational opportunities offered in the ELECTRA project within the Euregion Meuse Rhine, where the ALMA universities are located. The scope of the project however is much larger and aimed at delivering proof of the possibilities of advanced services and applications on a large scale.  Affordable network access to the universities is essential in providing SME's with user-friendly information tools and services that could open up new markets and provide fresh opportunities. ELECTRA is aimed at the realisation of a set of services and applications that will use a mix of the most advanced possibilities of the available information and communication technology, such as the combined use of ISDN, CATV, research nets (Internet), both from within the universities as from the homes and factories.  The educational goals are: integration and anchoring of telematic services in teaching and learning, focusing specifically on the impact and contribution of telematics for self-directed and collaborative learning.  The project will enable participating students, tutors and researchers, home-learners and SME's, medical practitioners and hospitals in the Euregion Meuse-Rhine, to access education and training and provide them with the necessary skills and experience, in order to work confidently and comfortably with information technology (IT).

High performance thermoelectric materials require high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. Our approach is to engineer thermoelectric materials which enhance the electrical conductivity while simultaneously blocking the tranport of thermal energy through the devices. Bulk 2D Si/SiGe superlattices, laterally patterned 1D nanowires and 0D quantum dots made from Si/SiGe heterostructure technology will be investigated for high performance thermoelectrics in microsystems and other applications. We propose to combine the optimum 2D superlattice or 0D quantum dot material with 1D nanowire patterning to further improve the thermoelectric performance of microgenerators. The final optimised thermoelectric generator will be integrated with a capacitor energy store on a mm-sized single silicon chip to demonstrate a power source for an autonomous system. This will be used to power a micropower CMOS sensor to demonstrate its use as an energy harvesting system. The developed technology will be compatible with the power supply requirements for wireless autonomous systems such as those defined in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.

It is estimated that over 5% of the global population , suffers from disabling hearing impairment. Moreover, nearly 15% of the global adult population is affected by some degree of hearing loss. Majority of which is found in the less developed nations. The most used way of communication  is the sign language that comes in many forms, there are over \200 sign languages (ASL, BSL, FSL, etc.) in use around the world today, three categories of sign languages: 1) Deaf sign languages – the main language of deaf communities; 2) Auxiliary sign languages; 3) Signed modes of oral languages (known as manually coded languages). Another way of communication is to use an interpreter (Or remote VRS interpreter) to communicate with a hearing person, whichis not instantaneous as you have to book the service online or you have to hire one. Our innovative solution: AccessibleTranslation aims to permanently solve the communication problem of deaf and hearing-impaired people in their daily life. They will be able to handle their work without the need of an interpreter, a sign language speaker or trained staff in sign language. Our platform provides a real-time captioning, it captures and translates sign language into audio, it also transforms audio into sign languages, and it also translates text into sign language. It can be easily integrated in different platforms. We now aim to introduce our patent-pending solution to the assistive technologies market across Europe as initial target market and worldwide seeing how our solution offers significant communication performance and improvements and is market disrupting in its potential (Ref.

46,95596,Yes,Learning to learn together: A visual language for social orchestration of educational activities,"Current pedagogy increasingly fails to engage young people with the study of Science and Math (S&M) in a way that threatens the future of Europe. Without basic S&M knowledge it is not possible to understand many of the important issues that confront us, such as global warming or genetic modification. A general lack of S&M literacy makes the ideal of Europe as a participatory democracy an unattainable goal, and means that the new products required for thriving in a global knowledge economy will not be developed. To address this problem, this project proposes to explore the potential of social learning for S&M by providing a visual language to support online groups in designing their own learning together. To gain deep knowledge of any specific domain learners need to integrate learning experiences with shared reflection through dialogue, in a way that builds conceptual understanding cumulatively. To this end, the objectives of the proposed project are: to further our understanding of meta-learning within collaborative communities engaged in S&M learning; to design a visual language to support students' reflection on their individual and collaborative learning; to implement a platform integrating state-of-the-art argumentation tools with exploratory environments; to develop an adaptive diagnostic system utilizing AI techniques to support students and teachers during the collaboration and learning to learn process; to develop appropriate pedagogies to inform the design of the technical system; and to design new forms of assessment of the individual and collaborating learning exploiting the diagnostic system. Seven partners from 5 countries compose the consortium. Besides the technical development of the system, in its 3-year life the project will address the underlying pedagogical theory and extensive experimentation in classroom (ages 12-16) in the partners' countries.

659,186128,No,The role of visual cues in speech segmentation and the acquisition of word order: a study of  monolingual and bilingual adults and infants,"Adults and infants make use of both auditory and visual information in speech perception. The available visual cues include oral-articulatory movements (e.g., lip movements), as well as non-verbal gestures (e.g., head-movements). The present project seeks to investigate the role of visual cues as an aid for auditory prosody in speech segmentation and in bootstrapping syntactic development, topic that remains as yet unexplored. The present project focuses on a type of prosodic information, i.e., the acoustic realization of phrasal prominence, which has been proposed to potentially allow prelexical infants bootstrap the basic word order of the target language, a major syntactic property of natural languages. Phrasal prominence correlates systematically with word order, i.e., it is realized by means of pitch changes in OV languages, and changes in duration in VO languages. The series of experiments here presented aim to: (i) identify and measure the visual cues—facial gestures—that potentially accompany the prosodic cues—changes in pitch and duration—correlated with word order differences, and (ii) examine whether visual cues modulate or determine the segmentation preferences of adult and infant monolinguals and bilinguals of an unknown language that additionally contains prosodic cues. In a series of artificial language learning experiments participants will be familiarized with artificial languages that contain either matching or mismatching auditory and visual cues—which will displayed by means of a computer-animated avatar—and will be subsequently tested on their segmentation preferences.

Education, Sources, and Issues","The proposed project is an interdisciplinary research on the philosophical development of Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805), one of the most prominent European intellectual figures between late Enlightenment and Idealism. The research considers the period from Schiller’s first attendance of philosophy classes in 1773 to his very first adoption of Kantian ideas in 1789, and will provide the first multi-faceted and comprehensive monograph on the young Schiller’s thought, as well as papers and presentations in Europe and the US. The main aim is to demolish the enduring myth of Schiller’s philosophical dilettantism and re-evaluate his philosophical stature independently of Kant. The method will be multi- and interdisciplinary, thus avoiding misinterpretations common to one-sided approaches, connecting the histories of philosophy, literature, ideas and universities. In particular, the research will focus on three aspects of the young Schiller’s commitment to philosophy: a) the curricula, dissertations, theses, speeches and lecture catalogues at the Stuttgart Karlsschule, where Schiller studied from 1773 until 1780; b) the impact of British moral/common sense theory, French Enlightenment and German philosophy on the making of Schiller’s thought; c) key  issues in Schiller’s early philosophy such as, for instance, God, knowledge, virtue, beauty, and love. An important shortfall in current scholarship that requires urgent attention and has been repeatedly highlighted in recent times, will thus be addressed.

911,102758,No,Engineering Vascularized Tissues,"Vascularization, the process in which new blood vessels assemble, is fundamental to tissue vitality. Vessel network assembly within 3D tissues can be induced in-vitro by means of multicellular culturing of endothelial cells (EC), fibroblasts and cells specific to the tissue of interest. This approach supports formation of endothelial vessels and promotes EC and tissue-specific cell interactions. Such EC-dependent tube-like openings may also form the basis for improved media penetration to the inner regions of thick 3D constructs, allowing for enhanced construct survival and for effective engineering of large complex tissues in the lab. Moreover, our own breakthrough results describe the beneficial impact of in vitro prevascularization of engineered muscle tissue on its survival and vascularization upon implantation. These studies have also demonstrated that implanted vascular networks of in vitro engineered constructs, can anastomose with host vasculature and form functional blood vessels in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying enhanced vascularization of endothelialized engineered constructs and implant-host vessel integration remain unclear. In this proposal, our research objectives are (1) to uncover the mechanisms governing in vitro vessel network formation in engineered 3D tissues and (2) to elucidate the process of graft-host vessel network integration and implant vessel-stimulated promotion of neovascularization in vivo. In addition, the impact of construct prevascularization on implant survival and function will be explored in animal disease models.  While there are still many challenges ahead, should we succeed, our research could lay the foundation for significantly enhanced tissue construct vascularization procedures and for their application in regenerative medicine. In addition, it may provide alternative models for studying the vascularization processes in embryogenesis and disease.",0,0
754,98416,No,Magnetic Energy Conversion in Fine Nanoparticle Systems,"'Magnetic energy conversion using nanoparticles is fundamental to many rapidly developing areas such as environment-friendly nanotechnologies or in biomedicine. Examples include the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MPs) in devices for magnetocaloric refrigeration or for heating in the hyperthermia treatment of cancer. Investing in these areas is imperative if the European Research Area and the European nanotechnologies industry it to gain a worldwide leadership. Essential are scientific developments and also professional training of researchers to provide them with skills in fundamental physics and applied technology aspects. The present proposal's aim in this direction is the career development of Dr. Hovorka combined with the enhancement of his scientific expertise in the field of MP systems. Despite their importance for applications, superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic MP mixtures have been poorly studied and, as a result, the effects of interactions and hysteresis on energy losses and heat generation can presently be analyzed only on the empirical level. The aim here is to develop a solid theoretical understanding of these issues by employing the state-of-the-art multi-scale and atomistic modeling approaches as well as large scale Monte-Carlo methods. The research will be carried out at the host University of York (UK) and benefit from the top-class computational research facilities and the long standing scientific and industrial experience of Prof. Chantrell, who is the world leading scientific contributor in the field. The inter-disciplinary expertise gained during the program as well as new perspectives gathered through the transnational mobility, will put Dr. Hovorka into an excellent position to build an entirely new research portfolio and to effectively interface with leading industry researchers and developers in the future. This will strengthen the European excellence and competitiveness in the research field of applied and fundamental nano-magnetism.'",0,0
499,111443,No,TRansforming Institutions by Gendering contents and Gaining Equality in Research,"TRIGGER aims at promoting systemic interventions designed to have deep, long lasting and widespread impacts at all the different levels in 5 research organisations. The project, coordinated and co-funded by the Italian Government, assisted by an institute specialised in gender and science, involves as co-funders five universities from different EU countries (Czech Republic, France, Italy, UK, Spain). Building on the results of earlier projects, integrated actions will be implemented at each university addressing different sides of gender inequality in science, i.e.: 1) Working environment, formal/informal culture and explicit/tacit rules (awareness-raising; collection of gender-sensitive data; support in the early stages of scientific careers; promotion of work-life balance, etc.). 2) Content and methods of scientific research, to acknowledge its gender dimension and impact (updating of teaching curricula; gendering the design of research and technological innovation; allocation of funds for gendered research; contrasting stereotypes about women in science, etc.). 3) Scientific leadership at different levels (selection procedures and criteria for the evaluation of scientific merit; introduction of equality targets in decision making bodies; enhancement of women researchers’ visibility, etc.). Each of the 5 involved partners have designed and will carry out a tailored action plan including measures related to all 3 sides, whose relative weight depends on their specific characteristics, situations and needs. TRIGGER will be characterised by integration, customisation, systematic nature, concreteness. Public debate and awareness will be generated on these issues Europe-wide. Added value will be yielded both on the strategic level, by the strong focus on gendering research, and on the operational level, through fostering mutual learning among partners and among the different European structural change projects, giving birth to an Integrated Model.",1,0
377,199652,No,Re(defining) CD4+ T Cell Identities One Cell at a Time,"The immune system consists of a complex continuum of cell types that communicate with each other and non-immune tissues in homeostasis, and during infections, autoimmunity and cancer. Conventional transcriptional and functional profiling enabled by cell surface marker sorting has revealed a great deal about how specific cell types operate en masse, yet important transcriptional heterogeneity that exists within cell populations remains unexplored. High-throughput single cell RNA-seq can overcome this limitation by profiling entire transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells, revealing cell-to-cell variation by decoding patterns within populations masked in bulk transcriptomes. We will exploit this to dissect the mouse CD4\ T cell compartment, a heterogeneous white blood cell population that initiates adaptive immune responses. In AIM 1, we will chart the dynamics of in vivo CD4\ cell states in mouse before, during and after immune response challenges. By sequencing thousands of single cell transcriptomes, we will map the landscape of CD4\ T cell states in an unbiased, quantitative and comprehensive way.  In AIM 2, we will predict key transcription factors, cell surface markers, and signalling molecules, including cytokines/chemokines in each cell state through novel computational approaches. Furthermore, our analyses will establish regulatory modules and networks of gene-gene interactions active in immune responses.  In AIM 3, we will (a) confirm the in vivo impact of new cell states by performing adoptive cell transfer assays; and  (b) validate our predictions of regulatory molecules and interactions using a massively parallel CRISPR/Cas knockout screen in vitro.  This powerful integrated approach combines single cell RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics and genetic engineering to dissect CD4\ T cell states, a central compartment of mammalian adaptive immunity, and reveal basic principles of gene regulation.",0,0

992,52167,No,"Urban development programme, urban governance, social inclusion and urban sustainability","Problems to be solved During the last decade all over Europe urban development programmes have been established with a view to combat urban problems and/or to stimulate urban dynamics. These programmes have been set up in a new policy-making context, that of urban governance, the development of which they have often stimulated. Three problems will be addressed in this project. What are the effects of urban development programmes on social inclusion and urban sustainability? How did certain forms of urban governance shape these programmes, their definition, their implementation and their successes and failures? How has the presence of these programmes changed urban governance or even stimulated forms of urban governance (the feedback loop). Scientific objectives and approach To answer these problems, the project undertakes a multilevel research in 32 neighbourhoods in 9 countries. The cases are selected on two criteria. Firstly, neighbourhoods must be part of an urban development programme. They are, however, selected in such a way that a sufficient range of differentiation is obtained on a number of crucial variables. Second, to minimise new and expensive research, data should be available for at least two time periods. The research integrates multiple levels and will proceed from a comparative perspective, but will focus on the European dimension. The effects of urban programmes on social inclusion in deprived urban areas, on sustainability in the selected cities and on urban governance are assessed through the analysis of a multilevel database and through cross-evaluation by the international project team. To perform that task, smaller teams of four experts are selected from the project members and perform their evaluation in cities in a 'foreign' country, assisted by the local partner. Expected impacts A network of stakeholders is developed and activated through this collaboration and through the production of a handbook. The evaluation focuses on 'benchmarking' for evaluating the processes and outcomes of the programmes (in terms of strengths and weaknesses of types of programmes and of related forms of urban governance). The conceptual and theoretical framework forms a strong basis for a common database that will contain both quantitative and qualitative data at different levels. This framework and the methodology offer opportunities to develop a genuine European approach. A number of concrete deliverables will be developed that can be used by end-users; such as the network, reports that puts local initiatives in a European comparative context, the handbook with models of good practice. UDPs can have different effects, depending on the context, which can be defined in general terms but also in terms of the premises of the UDPs: - It is sufficient to increase the quantity and quality of the housing stock and of the urban environment in order to increase a city's sustainability? - Will the reduction of processes of social exclusion automatically lead to the promotion of social inclusion? - Is promoting a 'social mix'always the best solution? - Does focusing of areas necessarily lead to positive effects for the city? The most important cross-national dimension that needs to be taken into account when relating our findings to the policy formation process is the move 'from government to governance': that is, to - more active policies regarding social inclusion; - more locally determined policies; - 'partnership' involving the voluntary and private sectors more closely; - a more fragmented pattern of decision making that requires new forms of integration.  Some conclusions regarding the UDPs We see striking similarities between (emerging) concepts and processes (globalisation, social exclusion, social cohesion), problem descriptions (high unemployment, ethnic tensions, ageing populations, unemployment), policy rhetoric and objectives (increasing sustainability and social cohesion) and techniques (area-based policies, co-operation, networking, participation). There is 'a convergence of views about the problems they face and the kind of policy responses they should be adopting'. Particular themes and issues that stand out in the context of recent urban policies across Europe are: electoral systems, such as compulsory voting stimulating 'protest votes'; continuity within approaches, leading to relatively straight forward adaptation to new conditions, like the 'master plan' policy changes; intra-country differences through variant policy innovations; impact of wider political-economic events; traditions of centralism and the complex relationships between central and 'lower' political and administrative levels; inheritance of previous authoritarian political regimes. However, our research also reveals differences relating to governance context rooted in socio-institutional patterns and traditions. These patterns and traditions add up to variation in: socio-spatial structures; political and administrative arrangements; practices of local and regional government; and relationships between government and the public at large embedded in wider relations between institutions of the state and civil society.  Five aspects that distinguish case studies stands out: Timing Initiator Motivations Problem areas Anchorage in a broad institutional framework In other words, while we observe policy convergence on the one hand, we are simultaneously witnessing diversity among nations in terms of governance characteristics. To try and grasp and conceptualise this double dynamic and work towards a conceptual framework for analysis has become one of the challenges of the UGIS project. This framework should, we believe, offer a means for explaining the differences among nations in terms of their governance characteristics, and also the means for guiding comparative analysis across the UGIS case studies. We argue that a conceptual framework should be based on a combination of welfare regimes and governance models offers the means to analyse these shifts in governance and the balance between state and non-state, central and local, through UDPs in Europe. Such a framework, we hope, offers the starting point for subsequent comparison of UDPs and other policies across Europe. Relevance for policy-making The aim of our handbook for policy-makers ('How to make a successful urban development programme?') is to present the knowledge they have collected in an encompassing, systematic and concise way to all those who are, or in the future will be, involved in the conception and implementation of UDPs: Urban Development Programmes.  What should be done? What should be avoided? What is feasible? What is not? Who should be involved at what moment? What are the benefits and pitfalls of an area-based, integral approach to urban renewal? How can the sustainability of results of UDPs be improved? How to develop and use a budget? How can results be evaluated? These are some of the basic questions we will try to answer, using the experience of people in the field. What is the use of communicating experiences of different actors in different institutional contexts? In the last chapter of the 'handbook for policy-makers' , we present a final roundup in the form of a checklist, which can be used to evaluate UDPs in the stage of conception. A draft-UDP can be put to the test by answering the questions that follow. The more positive answers, the better the odds are that the UDP will be successful. If several answers are negative, there are good reasons to reconsider the UDP as it is.",0,0
581,217796,No,My Science - Our Science,"'The impact of researchers’ work on society and citizens has never been more apparent than now. At the same time, there is an impending risk of loosing citizens’ trust in science, due to incresed amount of misinformation about science and research. Therefore, it is important to promote the key role that researchers have for the development and growth of our societies in a national and international context, and for keeping the public informed about critical challenges and scientific discoveries that have an impact on our daily lives. In Iceland, science has a crucial role to play in a society that relies to a great extent on nature and responsible use of natural resources, from renewable energy and sustainable blue growth to the societal and cultural implications of living in coastal communites. In order to ensure and facilitate interaction with the public and society at large, the project 'My Science – Our Science' aims to organise European Researchers Night in Iceland with the aim to invite researchers to engage with the public to communicate their work, their passion and their findings in order to increase the awareness of research and innovation activities. The objective is to enhance a positive public perception of researchers by facilitiating an open and active dialogue between researchers and citizens of all ages, especially focusing on children and young people that could consider a research career. In addition to higlighting the importance of researchers’ work, the initiative provides a rare opportunity for researchers to communicate directly with the public at all ages and even to involve citizens in the road to scientific discoveries, thus contributing to the transparency of their work and enhancing the attractiveness of scientific careers, which is instrumental in encouraging young people to embark on a career in research.'",0,0
668,198406,No,Nanotechnology Mutual Learning Action Plan For Transparent And Responsible Understanding Of Science And Technology,"Innovative solutions to society’s challenges need to be developed with the involvement of all stakeholders through a dynamic, iterative, mutually responsible process. To achieve this, greater understanding of required stakeholder interactions as well as their needs and concerns is required. Societal engagement in nanotechnology has been tackled previously. However, prior learning needs to be brought together and built on by addressing shortcomings identified, particularly putting in place a sustainable means for this to continue. NANO2TRUST will establish a European-wide sustainable platform for mutual learning and informed dialogue among all stakeholders (researchers including social sciences and humanities, industry/ business, the public including Civil Society Organisations and the media, as well as policy-makers and research funders) to improve transparency and societal engagement in responsible nanotechnology. Engaged through European-wide initiatives, as well as via an online platform making full use of current communication technologies, stakeholders will exchange best practice (e.g. from ObservatoryNano, NanoOpinion, NanoEIS and Nanodiode, among others). They will also develop their understanding of responsible research and innovation (RRI) and its tools (e.g. based on EthicSchool and RRI Tools). Based on this, through national and EU level dialogue, stakeholders will develop an action plan (MLAP) with a shared vision on existing and potential future benefits and risks of advancing nanotechnology including ways to support RRI along the value chain. Systemic engagement of policy-makers and relevant communities will facilitate “buy-in” through co-development of roadmaps to drive future Joint Stakeholder Undertakings, such as the Nanofutures ETP. This will result in a permanent platform for future development of trust, awareness and inclusion, providing guidance on societal needs and concerns, and fuelling co-innovation that benefits society as a whole.",0,0
153,74632,Yes,European learning GRID infrastructure,"The European Learning Grid Infrastructure (E-LeGI) project has the ambitious goal to develop software technologies for effective human learning. With the E-LeGI project we will promote and support a learning paradigm shift. A new paradigm focused on knowledge construction using experiential based and collaborative learning approaches in a contextualised, personalised and ubiquitous way will replace the current information transfer paradigm focused on content and on the key authoritative figure of the teacher who provides information.  We have chosen a synergic approach, sometimes called human centred design, to replace the classical, applicative approach to learning. With consideration of humans at the centre, learning is clearly a social, constructive phenomenon. It occurs as a side effect of interactions, conversations and enhanced presence in dynamic Virtual Communities: experimental research concepts integrating new powerful developments of services in the Semantic GRID, the leading edge of currently available and future ICT technologies, with highly innovative and powerfully significant scenarios of human learning.  The E-LeGI project has three main objectives: - To study and define new models of human centred learning enabling ubiquitous and collaborative learning, merging experiential, personalised, and contextualised approaches. - To study, design and implement an advanced service-oriented Grid based software architecture for learning. This will allow us to access and integrate different technologies, resources and contents that are needed in order to realise the new paradigm according to Objective 1. - Within the context of a single Integrated Project, we will research, develop, deploy, validate, and evaluate the GRID based software architecture for learning and the human centred approaches, through the use of SEES (Service Elicitation and Exploitation Scenarios), pilots and demonstrators.",0,1
138,88083,Yes,Introspective journey and change: is adult development possible?,"For all of the time, effort, and money invested in attempts to help individuals develop through education, training and coaching, there are few studies that really assess the real impact of the change process. Reasons for this paucity are lack of convenience and practicality of longitudinal designs to study demonstrable results at the individual level. Additionally, the intricacies of adult development may cast a shadow over the understanding of the individual change process, for example, the “honeymoon effect” of the typical training programs might start with improvement immediately following the program, but within months it drops precipitously (Campbell et al., 1970) or the “sleeper effect”, that states that reactions to events do not appear until six to twelve months following completion of the change effort (McClelland, 1970). The INSEAD Global Leadership Centre (IGLC) is engaged in an endeavor to promote adult development in its executive programs. Properly designed 360-degree feedback questionnaires developed by the IGLC constitute the trigger of an introspective journey, and set into motion changes in behavior (Kets de Vries, Vrignaud, Florent-Treacy & Korotov, 2007). To study the relationship between the questionnaires will provide a comprehensive structure of the instruments while helping to design development plans that are coherent with the individuals and their desired change process.  These instruments are the basis for studying the leadership development in management education. This research has the objective of assessing in what ways and to what extend transformational programmes enhance individual development. It is an in-depth, longitudinal study of IGLC interventions designed to foster capabilities in individuals and groups (e.g. training and coaching efforts that target self-awareness and other abilities). This research may include in-depth qualitative inquiry as well as quantitative assessment of effectiveness.",0,1

Our main target group is students between the age of 8-20, but we aim to address all age groups with attractive programmes. Some novelties of our project: offering challenge-oriented activities – each of our 18 venues will present their innovative solutions related to interdisciplinary societal challenges; focussing on the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation - the audience will be informed about key elements of RRI, thus creating better understanding and fostering future involvement; launching “Science in the City” – a flash mob like activity, involving the public in spectacular experiments. We will apply an integrated approach in our project in which interdisciplinary challenges, innovative solutions, (young) researchers, their work and hobbies will be presented in an interactive, educating and entertaining way. The target audience can thus discover that being a researcher is cool and creative; researchers, but and young innovators are amongst us. Our objective is to have around 30000 visitors at the events, but a multiple of that number (around 500000) will see, hear or read about the Night. We intend to raise awareness of the European engagement in R&I; in the European Corners and at each venue related programmes of the European Union (FP7, H2020, especially MSCA) will be visible. The structure of the consortium: an innovative SME, a state-owned applied research institution, a highly innovative large company, a scientific association with a broad network of local member institutions all over Hungary and an independent think tank established by economists and sociologists together with numerous contributing partners of all kinds will ensure the success of the project.",1,0
751,71876,No,European Internet accessibility observatory,"As the information society develops, and the number of public and private online services increase the impact of 'digital divide' grows. Appropriate uses of new technologies can bridge the divide and even enable new user groups to access information and participate in communication. In particular, people with disabilities may benefit from this development.  The overall goal of the project is to improve access to Internet content for people with special needs such as visual impairment or users accessing web content by mobile phones. Moreover, we want to encourage competition based on merit among content designers, tool developers and software vendors. We believe that frequently updated ranking lists showing accessibility indicators of online European content can trigger a development to enable new user groups to participate in eEurope and improve the competitiveness of European content industry.  Tools, standards and guidelines to enable more users to participate exist. However, current online content is in many cases not leading the web to its full potential. On the contrary, there are many examples of barriers unintentionally preventing groups of users to participate. We believe regular assessments of accessibility indicators published online will help to raise awareness fuelling the efforts for better solutions.  We intend to develop a robot collecting accessibility information in a Datawarehouse. The design will cater for inclusion of additional web metrics at a later, and support multiple installations cooperating in data collection and in providing richer query results. A major activity is focussed on developing web metrics and validating them engaging different user groups.  The results are to be spread by deploying Open Source development of all Software, provide a web interface to the collected data, organise an annual conference, publish an annual report on European web accessibility and by offering services such as courses and retrofitting.",1,0
219,63254,No,TRAining of Network Security Incident Teams Staff,"TRANSITS will promote the establishment of CSIRTs and the enhancement of existing CSIRTs by addressing the problem of the shortage of skilled CSIRT staff. This goal will be achieved by providing specialist-training courses to train staff of (new) CSIRTs in the organisational, operational, technical, market and legal issues involved in providing CSIRT services.  In particular, TRANSITS will: - develop, update and regularly revise modular training course material; - organise training workshops where the course materials will be delivered; - enable the participation of staff members of (new) CSIRTs in these training \ workshops, with a particular emphasis on the participation from the EU accession states; - disseminate the training course materials and ensure exploitation of the results.  Objectives: Increasing the proportion of European networks that have Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) services is a major part of improving the dependability of networks and promoting public confidence in them. The objective of the TRANSITS project is to promote the creation of more, professional CSIRTs and the strengthening of existing CSIRTs. Operating a CSIRT takes rare and specialist skills; currently there are only a few hundred experts in Europe who have the necessary knowledge and experience. The TRANSITS project will address this problem by providing specialist training to staff members of new CSIRTs and new staff members of existing CSIRTs.  Work description: Course materials will be developed and maintained. Before the start of the TRANSITS project course materials have already been prepared, but these will need to be edited, maintained and updated during the lifetime of the project. At intervals during the project, reviews will be held to reflect comments from trainees and teachers as well as changes in the external environment. It is planned that during the lifetime of the project the course material will be presented six times, and it is intended to spread the locations of these six training workshops over various regions in Europe. Each presentation of the course requires logistical preparations and support: identifying a suitable location, advertising the course and selecting the trainees, arranging financial support for teachers and trainees if needed, and arranging accommodation. The six actual presentations of the course will be done partly by staff of the project partners and partly by experienced staff members of other CSIRTs who have committed themselves for these tasks. Each training workshop will be rounded off with a report on the workshop, its preparations, its contents and the experiences of the presenters and the trainees.  A separate work package will cover the overall management of the project: ensuring that milestones are met, quality assurance and reporting. Also the project's dissemination activities are part of the work package. The course materials will be put in the public domain. Through copyright ownership it will be ensured that a wide distribution of the material is not obstructed by monopolisation of information or commercial exploitation by certain parties. The project partners take responsibility for creating a suitable permanent framework after the completion of the project for delivering further training courses and regularly updating the material.  Milestones: Milestones: - delivery of the course materials at 6 training workshops at regular intervals during the project; - a first edition of the course materials early in the project and a second edition as a result of a major revision after three training workshops.  Expected results: an increase of the number of skilled CSIRT staff in Europe by 50% as a direct result of the TRANSITS training and a doubling as a consequence of the further dissemination of the TRANSITS materials.",0,0

683,225790,No,Building an evidence base to support Polish women victims of domestic violence in the UK.,"This 21 month MSCA Fellowship will develop a vital evidence base for domestic violence services in the UK and Europe to improve reporting and access to support by Polish migrant women in violent relationships. This will be achieved by conducting the first study of domestic violence amongst Polish migrant women living in the UK or indeed in any EU country.  The research will capture the various factors shaping the domestic violence experiences of Polish women and work of practitioners (specialist domestic violence workers, social workers, police officers). The findings will also enhance conceptual understanding of how migration and transnational factors shape domestic violence. The Fellowship will draw on an inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration between Dr Iwona Zielińska (Researcher), Supervisor Celia Madden – the manager of EDAN Lincs (Host organisation) and an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Lincoln (secondment). This will ensure applied, practice-focused research and training with a 6-month inter-sectoral secondment to the UoL for academic input. The Society & Enterprise route of the MSCA scheme serves best to realise the practice-related aim of the research and to advance Dr Zielińska’s career goal of becoming an expert in translating research evidence to practice settings. A combination of qualitative methods from media studies, sociology and organizational studies, and the use of online tool NodeXL,will be used to obtain a holistic picture and in-depth knowledge on the problem from various perspectives. The Fellowship will thus generate the first research findings on this important dimension of vulnerability and harm.

The goal of the project is two-fold: on one hand, to study the properties of the category F of   explore further how these properties translate into statements on the unstable module side, and the other way round. Generic representation theory is a very young subject, so there are many open questions, e.g. the Artinian conjecture which is of particular importance because of its connection to Algebraic K-theory. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact) In Paris I will be working with Prof. Schwartz who is one of the leading experts in this field in Europe, and with G. Powell who has been doing research especially on problems related to the Artinian conjecture. - Being a topologist, I anticipate that during my stay in Paris I will also deepen my knowledge of the representation theoretical methods which are required to better understand the category F.

696,97414,No,"Role of the lysosomal dysfunction during aging, and implication for Parkinson’s Disease","Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no proven neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapy. The most consistent risk factor for developing PD is increasing age. PD is a disease where substantial cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta occurs alongside the formation of Lewy Bodies (LB). Although LB represent a pathological hallmark of PD, their mechanisms of formation and significance for the disease process remain unknown.  In Specific Aim (SA) I, we will assess the role of the lysosomal dysfunction during aging and in PD, and its implication in the cell death and in the process of aggregate formation relevant to PD. This project will be tested (i) in vitro, using senescence accelerated cells, in physiological conditions, with pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the lysosomal-mediated degradation pathway, and with different PD-related cellular alterations (ii) in vivo, using senescence-accelerated mouse, to promote age-dependent aggregates formation following exposure with PD-related cellular alterations.  In SA II, we will study the ill-defined protein ATP13A2 which the mutations are associated with Hereditary Parkinsonism. We will characterize (i) in vitro the functions in physiologic situation and we will analyse the consequences of the ATP13A2 mutated proteins in the lysosomal function and in cell death. We will assess the implication of this protein towards the accumulation of non-degraded material and also aggregates formation (ii) in vivo with the generation of a transgenic mouse for the mutation of ATP13A2 on the long view.  In SA III, we hypothesize that the presence of a pathogenic factor in the brain milieu could affect the aggregate formation and/or the death of dopaminergic neurons. This hypothesis will be tested (i) in vivo, by injecting filtrated fractions coming from cerebrospinal fluid from PD patients in non-human primates brains and we will let those animals getting older for years.",0,0

The University is recognised for its strong research capabilities in the areas of high performance computing and algorithm design in the physical and biological sciences. Terascale computating with storage facilities, and immersive visualisation facilities will be an integral part of the consolidation of the computational scientists in the new Information Technology and Advanced Computing programme in Trinity.  Trinity has identified a gap in the multidisciplinary competencies of the University between these two exciting areas of research. The objective of this proposal is to strengthen the bridge between these two competencies and to provide new validated molecular dynamics simulation tools to enhance the research capabilities of the bioscience and nanoscience groups. This objective will be achieved by transferring the experience of experts to assist in identifying the needs of these scientists and working with local researchers to customise existing molecular dynamics packages t o meet their requirements.  The work will lead to faster, more efficient MD calculations in the Nano/Life sciences. The close interaction in Trinity between the bio/nanoscientist and computational science groups is somewhat unique in Europe.

702,35030,No,European Research and Consensus on Interactive Multimedia,"The aim of the EURORIM project is to support the ACTS concertation activities in the field of multimedia. In particular EURORIM supports the work of the SII Chain and Domain 1. An important element therein is the development and dissemination of guidelines for the implementation of advanced multimedia services, based on the work of the projects in the SII chain. Guidelines in this area will be targeted at the main sector actors, including users, in multimedia communication. Guidelines are collective output of the projects in the ACTS programme and represent helpful reference documentation to existing and new sector actors in order to plan their business in the complex environment of post 1998 Europe. Dissemination of Guidelines will be a major objective for EURORIM, to which it has dedicated a significant amount of manpower. The sector actors, including user and SMEs, are all addressed in the dissemination activity of the project. Wide-dissemination workshops, as well as more targeted actions towards specific classes of recipients are planned within the activities of the project. Special attention is given to the Central and Eastern European countries, and two of the partners in the consortium, from Hungary and Poland respectively, have been given the specific task of dissemination in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The main 1996 achievements are: development and release of a first set of SII Guidelines; support to SII Chain and Domain 1, with provision of a report on the results achieved during the year; support to Euro-IDMS initiative; a document indicating the current state of development of the work has been released; set-up of electronic communication facilities (WWW, discussion fora, ftp, e-mail reflectors); definition of the work plan for dissemination; definition of the cost-profit model analysis for multimedia services related to the residential market. Future activities will include: dissemination of results; support to the SIA Chain; development and analysis of evolution scenarios and regulatory aspects; techno-economic analysis based on data from SII project trials. Expected Impact The more visible impact of the project is expected particularly with regard to the dissemination of guidelines and of accompanying information; dissemination is a key activity and responsibility of the project, and involves in addition to the dissemination itself, promotion activities, and preparation of the material for dissemination. The project is expected to have a less visible, but equally important impact on the development of the guidelines: in a close interaction with the chain contributions will be made to the scope, coverage, accessibility and quality of the guidelines. Also a significant impact on the development of multimedia services in Europe is expected through the Euro-IDMS initiative. The Euro-IDMS initiative has as its main objective the formulation of a MoU among the sector actors for the definition and implementation, in Europe-wide trials, of a set of specifications (based on a selection of a tightly defined set of options drawn from current specification in, e.g., DAVIC and DVB) for the deployment of interoperable multimedia services and applications.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables A report on service interoperation guidelines. Contribution to the programme Production and dissemination of guidelines for the deployment of advanced multimedia services in the competitive market of post 1998 Europe.  Technical Approach An integral part of the project work is constituted by the provision of a full support to the SII chain activities both from a technical and from a logistic point of view. The work of the chain is further complemented by providing techno-economic analysis and demand assessment based on the results of the trials of the SII projects. Support will also be provided to the Domain 1 activities by assisting in the preparation of the Domain 1 overall workplan and meeting agenda. EURORIM will provide assistance for the preparation of the Domain 1 meeting reports and will provide logistic and technical support for the preparation of Domain 1 special events such as workshops. Provision of support to the SIA Chain for the development of the SIA guidelines has also become part of the project tasks as a results of the first year activities. The actual co-operation method and support mechanism will be developed during the current year of activities. The EURORIM consortium has been established in such a way that representatives of the different sector actors have active roles in key areas. This ensures that the competence and interests of the key players are considered in the development of the guidelines. Particular attention will be paid to the different players of the multimedia world, ensuring that roles and interfaces are well specified; thereby taking into consideration technical and non-technical aspects, such as regulation and security requirements. The project has been very attentive, since its conception, to the requirements of the SII Chain and has made provisions to guarantee full co-operation between the project and the chain. Most of the partners in the project are already active in a project of the SII chain and the selection of partners has been made in order to provide the technical competence to cover the different clusters of the chain activity. EURORIM carefully considers the ongoing activities within the ACTS Programme as well as outside. Links have been developed to existing ACTS projects to ensure synergy and avoid duplication of efforts. External bodies are also important for EURORIM, that monitors their activities and creates a focus for consensus building activities within the chain in order to promote European views to world-wide organisations such as ITU-T, DAVIC, or the ATM-Forum. An important point of interest for the project are the ETSI activities contributing to the development of an European position on Information Society standardisation Summary of Trial By its nature EURORIM closely follows the ACTS trials and their results.. The project itself is not directly involved in trials, however.

The complexity of dementia calls for a multidisciplinary approach; in this project I will combine the research fields of Epidemiology, Genetics, Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. It is crucial to identify persons at risk for developing dementia, as possible treatment interventions should be administered in an early stage of disease, before irreversible brain damage has occurred. Recent studies yield evidence that psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in the development of dementia. The exact underlying mechanism between psychosocial stress and dementia is however unclear and therefore I will investigate whether genetic susceptibility and accelerated telomere shortening interact with or mediate the effect of psychosocial stress on the onset of dementia. First, I propose to investigate whether persons with genetic susceptibilities are more prone for the detrimental effects of psychosocial stress factors on early symptoms of dementia. These genetic susceptibilities will be selected by conducting pathway analysis of mechanisms which have previously been related to dementia. Second, I will examine whether accelerated telomere shortening can explain the relation between psychosocial stress and early symptoms of dementia. I will do this in two large longitudinal population-based cohort studies, namely the SNAC-K study and SATSA study. And third I will translate the findings from the epidemiological studies into a cognitive neuroscience experiment in which I will investigate whether the effect of chronic psychosocial stress on brain activity and gray matter volume can be modified by aging and a common genetic variation. This will be done by conducting a functional MRI study using a working memory task and an emotional cognitive control task. This highly innovative and multidisciplinary project will greatly improve our knowledge on how stress affects the aging brain.'""",0,0

We all partners agree that the current skills of science graduates in the technologies covered by this project are still insufficient. The project also tries to address the shortage of scientists and engineers in Europe in the next future by offering an attractive plan of training and research, with strong  colaboration between industry and academia.  From a technical point of view, the training is focused on acquiring awareness of new potential technologies, as well as, new capabilities to be implemented within the design process. Intention is to extend the range of simulation available today, both in physics understanding and new technologies coming from the consortium. Direct impact is expected within methods that could support on the complicated analysis of flow separation (by introducing new techniques that provide insight about the stability of a given design), noise generation (early simulation capabilities based on current technologies in use), novel simulation techniques (that will reduce the design loop cost by reduction of resources needed to perform the same simulation),  solution quality increase (by improving the mesh generation quality assessment).

It is planned that employment contract for two years will be established. The main idea of the project is studying the possibility to use dendrimers as new detoxication agents.  This is an up-to-date issue due to the enhancement of chemical pollution in our environment that increases the risk of the intoxication. Dendrimers are large globular monodisperse polymers. As a result of their unique structure (many end groups on the surface and empty internal cavities) there are attempts to use them as drug carriers.  The idea of using them as effective and specific detoxication agents is absolutely new. Toxins can be attached to end groups or incorporate inside the macromolecule. Estimation of dendrimers binding capacity and checking their influence on plasma proteins will be performed to construct detoxication dendrimers.  The host institution re presents a high scientific level and large training expertise, is the participant of well established international collaborations networks and is actively present in the dendrimer field from its very beginning. It offers also a rich programme of complementary training.  The host institution is in a possession of modern, well-equipped labs with specialised instrumentation, which respond to the needs set by the project.

999,88603,No,"Actors, Markets, and Institutions in Developing Countries: A micro-empirical approach","Development Economics has seen an explosion of high quality empirical work in the past ten years. But despite the quality of many individual researchers, Europe is lagging behind the US in terms of number of students, faculty, and publications. Remedying this gap is important, not only for scientific reasons, but also because development research is a critical input to decision making by Governments and international Institutions. The partners in the proposed ITN are dedicated to producing the next generation of research scholars working on development issues in Europe. The ITN will  harness and combine intellectual resources which are scattered across Europe to offer doctoral students a first rate training, comparable to the best opportunities available worldwide. The Network will emphasise rigorous empirical methods put to the service of fundamental questions in development economics. The work will evolve around three workpackages: WP1 (Human capital and policy evaluation) will investigate how households respond to incentives, design policies to improve education and health, and evaluate their impact. WP2 (Market access for the poor) will study market imperfections in insurance, credit, product and labour markets and evaluate the effectiveness of innovative schemes to address them. WP3 (Institutions: Micro evidence) will study the emergence of social norms, the legacy of historical institutions, and their implications for governance and accountability. Training will involve student exchanges across nodes, participation in team research projects, and support for students’ travel and field work. The distinguishing features are: (a) formal coursework with emphasis on rigorous empirical methods and exposure to other disciplines in PhD courses,  workshops and summer schools. (b) active participation in data collection and field projects in developing countries, attained through participation in (often multidisciplinary) team research projects and internships with industry partners and NGOs.

1023,55448,No,Optimisation Service Provider,"Optimisation models are widely adopted in a number of industrial sectors including finance, supply chain planning, agriculture, and energy distribution. Optimisation is used as an analytical engine for competitive advantage in these and other sectors. Further, the adoption of an optimisation solution often requires a investment in technology, time, and staff, typically available only in large organisations. Recently there is a growing requirement for the use of optimisation by a wide range of companies leading us to OSP which: 1. Allows the use of optimisation tools without the significant cost of an in-house optimisation solution; 2. Provides vertical, generic and customisable end-user solutions for a number of industrial sectors; 3. Extends 1) and 2) by providing training through an ASP service.  OSP contributes to the community in two distinct ways. First, it extends the concept of ASP to include decision support applications. Second it includes training which is a critical factor for the use of optimisation by a wide user-base, that may not have the key expertise and/or resources to adopt optimisation for competitive advantage.  Objectives: We aim to develop an optimisation environment and offer it as an Application Service provider (ASP) solution. ASPs rent the use of business applications, which they implement, customise, and out-host for multiple end-user organisation and charge on a 'pay as you go' basis. By adopting the ASP model, and by adding further value to it in the form of optimisation-based analytic engines, we define an enhanced approach, which is an Optimisation Service Provider (OSP). This is a breakthrough in the provision of decision support applications, and is in agreement with key action IST-2 'new methods of work and electronic commerce'. Our approach transforms organisational use of operational research models and software tools. OSP achieves the IST objective of e-work, providing organisations with the choice to either use optimisation tools and develop and maintain their own models, or to use generic solutions and customise them to match the organisation's applications.  Work description: Four industrial sectors are targeted. JSS and UNI will coordinate, and collaborate with MIR and BWB to develop generic analytic engines, respectively for: A) asset and liability management; B) logistics and supply chain planning; C) energy distribution and; D) agricultural and environmental planning.  NTC will coordinate and collaborate with GIP and BWB in the development of an ASP package for making available the analytic engines over the Internet. All three SME proposers will coordinate, and collaborate with GIP, MIR, and BWB to implement the crucial link of integration between the analytical engines and the ASP. All partners will bring their expertise together to develop the training packages. The work of this project is grouped into eight (8) closely coupled workpackages involving: 1) preparatory actions; 2) development of generic solutions for A, B, C, D; 3) acquisition and configuration of essential infrastructure for OSP; 4) interfaces for customising A, B, C, D, applications; 5) connectivity with existing IT infrastructure; 6) development and implementation of ASP packages with the generic solutions; 7) training packages; 8) project management.  The technical work of the project is dominated by workpackages (2) through (5), which taken together constitute the OSP solution. Workpackage (7) adds to the value of OSP by training and knowledge transfer such that end-users can fully exploit the potential of OSP. The management workpackage (8) oversees the internal as well as the external aspects for the project and effectively knits together the SME proposers and the RTD performers. Internal aspects such as Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) exchange and project tasks completion are closely monitored. From the external viewpoint the vital business issues of market research and competition analysis and 'product packaging,' and the definition of the financial plan and exploitation strategy are effectively planned and managed.  Milestones: The SME proposers undertake market research, development of a financial plan and exploitation strategy, and project management. RTD performers undertake the development of the Optimisation Service Provider solution. The project milestones are set as: 1. Development of customisable optimisation solutions for supporting short-term and long-term planning and management; 2. ASP integration with the outcome(s) of (1), leading to OSP; 3. Development of novel training techniques for supporting OSP. On completion of the project the following deliverables have been completed: 1) Portfolio Planning web based analytical engine 2) Supply Chain Planning web based analytical engine 3) Agricultural Planning analytical engine utilising web-services 4) Web based optimisation modelling tools 5) Web based optimisation solving engines 6) Multilingual web based training packages  Please note that due to the difficulty in attracting end users/evaluators from the energy sector the development of the web based analytical engine for energy planning and distribution has been abandoned. On the other hand, we have enhanced the originally planned training material with a multilingual flavour. More specifically, we have developed training packages in Greek, French, Italian, German, and English. Finally, the agricultural sector decision support system has been modified to experiment and develop a platform that allows agricultural planning through the use of web services technologies.",0,0

It is an evolving and ambitious network engaged in an inter-disciplinary work and social change programme that spans research, teaching, policy development and outreach, and is oriented to strengthening the linkages and synergies between them.   While the EWI at UCD has a critical mass of researchers and the nucleus of a fine research and teaching team for the development of equality-sensitive research, it needs to augment its expertise if it is to become firmly embedded throughout the University as a significant inter-disciplinary force that can have an impact not only nationally but also at the European level, and through Europe at the global level.

389,223718,No,Spatio-temporal mechanisms of generative perception,"How do we rapidly and effortlessly compute a vivid veridical representation of the external world from the noisy and ambiguous input supplied by our sensors? One possibility is that the brain does not process all incoming sensory information anew, but actively generates a model of the world from past experience, and uses current sensory data to update that model. This classic idea has been well formulised within the modern framework of Generative Bayesian Inference. However, despite these recent theoretical and empirical advances, there is no definitive proof that generative mechanisms prevail in perception, and fundamental questions remain.   The ambitious aim of GenPercept is to establish the importance of generative processes in perception, characterise quantitatively their functional role, and describe their underlying neural mechanisms. With innovative psychophysical and pupillometry techniques, it will show how past perceptual experience is exploited to manage and mould sensory analysis of the present. With ultra-high field imaging, it will identify the underlying neural mechanisms in early sensory cortex. With EEG and custom psychophysics it will show how generative predictive mechanisms mediate perceptual continuity at the time of saccadic eye movements, and explore the innovative idea that neural oscillations reflect reverberations in the propagation of generative prediction and error signals. Finally, it will look at individual differences, particularly in autistic perception, where generative mechanisms show interesting atypicalities.  A full understanding of generative processes will lead to fundamental insights in understanding how we perceive and interact with the world, and how past perceptual experience influences what we perceive.

100,41898,Yes,Education governance and social integration and exclusion in Europe,"The background of this proposal concerns the controversies in education policy and in current research into new ways to govern education in terms of deregulation, steering by results, marketization and so on. It takes as its central proposition the argument that the many recent changes in education systems throughout Europe will have had an impact on education's capacity to combat exclusion and promote social integration. We seek to understand the different responses of different nation states to changes flowing from the restructuring of the global economy and the rethinking of links between education and the economy. We suggest that it is important to study differences and similarities in the responses of education systems to shared problems in order to improve understanting of the limits and possibilities of education policy within the community, and so that lessons learned from recent changes may be more widely sharede. It is our ambition to clarify relations between education governance and social integration and exclusion in different contexts, to discuss such issues, and share our findings with those engaged in education issues in our communities.   The design of the work is based on the need to elaborate categories and explore relations between education governance, social integration and exclusion, and the implications of diffrences in national contexts to these relations. A step-wise research approach is developed. It is built on cooperation between researchers from diffrent countries which are cases for comparisons.   The countries are: Australia (research funded elsewhere), Finland, Germany, Iceland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. They are chosen in order to make it possible to compare differences in education traditions, economic preconditions, etc, in order to get a more general understanding of different ways to govern education and implications under different circumstances.  Joint studies will be carried out in terms of text analysis of public discourses on new ways of governing educations, in depth interviews with politicians, civil servants, teachers, and head teachers. In addition reviews of research and reanalyses of national and international statistics will be performed. Such studies will lead to more differentiated categories that will make it possible to construct more precise hypotheses that can be subject to empirical tests. We will carry out such tests in separate studies performed by the national poll institutes. A focus of survey planned will be the implications of new ways to govern education for the social integration and exclusiont of youth.   Exploitation of this research is considered to be of vital importance. We will establish a series of seminars and workshops leading to joint publications of articles and books.

421,214667,No,Quantum nonlinear optics through Rydberg interaction,"Optical photons, for all practical purposes, do not interact. This fundamental property of light forms the basis of modern optics and enables a multitude of technical applications in our every-day life, such as all-optical communication and microscopy. On the other hand, an engineered interaction between individual photons would allow the creation and control of light photon by photon, providing fundamental insights into the quantum nature of light and allowing us to harness non-classical states of light as resource for future technology. Mapping the strong interaction between Rydberg atoms onto individual photons has emerged as a highly promising approach towards this ambitious goal. In this project, we will advance and significantly broaden the research field of Rydberg quantum optics to develop new tools for realizing strongly correlated quantum many-body states of photons. Building on our successful work over recent years, we will greatly expand our control over Rydberg slow-light polaritons to implement mesoscopic systems of strongly interacting photons in an ultracold ytterbium gas. In parallel, we will explore a new approach to strong light-matter coupling, utilizing Rydberg superatoms made out of thousands of individual atoms, strongly coupled to a propagating light mode. This free-space QED system enables strong coupling between single photons and single artificial atoms in the optical domain without any confining structures for the light. Finally, we will experimentally realize a novel quantum hybrid system exploiting the strong electric coupling between single Rydberg atoms and piezo-electric micro-mechanical oscillators. Building on this unique coupling scheme, we will explore Rydberg-mediated cooling of a mechanical system and dissipative preparation of non-classical phonon states. The three complementary parts ultimately unite into a powerful Rydberg quantum optics toolbox which will provide unprecedented control over single photons and single phonons.",0,0
129,93389,Yes,Researchers Night 2007 in the Czech Republic,"The purpose of this project is to plan, prepare and implement Researcher’s Night in three major cities and twenty three other locations throughout the Czech Republic. This project aims to: present researchers as “normal” people to the general public, show research professions as interesting and fun thus making them appealing to young people, promote science in elementary and secondary schools, and demonstrate how Europe supports its researchers and the sciences. Eliminating gaps and building bridges between researchers and the general public is also a focus of this project.  The Project is based on a partnership made up of five organisations. The participants have a wealth of experience with 5th and 6th Framework Programmes and with activities promoting researchers and science. Some of the partners also took part in Researcher’s Night 2006 in the Czech Republic.  When planning the programme and the individual activities, emphasis was placed on interactivity and entertainment. Hands-on practical experiments, scientific demonstrations, guided tours through different research workplaces, competitions, and games are the main types of attractions prepared for the public. Researchers will be also presented in unexpected professions such as musicians, photographers, or writers and this will help to change the public perception of researchers as “mad” people closed up in their secretive, distant labs. The compulsory drawing competition and the EU stand will also be implemented in the three major locations. European support of research and development will be also demonstrated and researchers who have benefited from the support will give testimony in person.   All in all, Researcher’s Night 2007 is a great opportunity for the public and the researchers to meet face to face and for proving that science plays an important part in our lives and that it can be also fun.",1,1
48,93708,Yes,Promoting inquiry in mathematics and science education across Europe,"This project aims to effect a change across Europe in the teaching and learning of mathematics and science with teachers supported to develop inquiry-based learning (IBL) pedagogies so that students gain experience of IBL approaches. Ultimately, our objective is a greater number of students with more positive dispositions towards further study of these subjects and the desire to be employed in related fields. The proposal brings together 13 teams of experts in IBL in mathematics and science education from 12 nations and will be led and managed by a researcher who has recent successful experience of European work of this type. The nine working packages will be led by appropriate experts from the wider team, who will ensure the successful completion of each stage of the project. Overall, our design of the project throughout has been focused so as to provide a multi-level dissemination plan addressed to teachers and important stakeholders to ensure maximum impact. This plan includes the provision of high quality support for, and training of, teachers and teacher trainers; selection of high quality materials and methods with which to work with teachers, supporting actions addressed to teachers to advertise IBL, methods of working with out-of-school parties such as local authorities and parents and summaries of analyses that will inform a wide range of policy makers about how they can support the required changes. Throughout the project’s timeline national consultancy panels and two international panels will provide on-going advice and orientation at key stages. To maximise the project’s “reach” to teachers either established networks for professional development of teachers will be expanded, or new networks will be built using models which have proven efficacy. Rigorous evaluation both by an internal team and an outside agency will provide formative and summative feedback about the validity of the project and its effectiveness.",1,1
925,199036,No,New technological advances for the third generation of Solar cells,"It is believed that solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be the next generation of power source, contributing for fostering the use of photovoltaics in buildings’ roofs and facades. Actually, their transparency, various possibilities of colors and high kWh/nominal power ratio offer to PSCs an opportunity to conquer markets that are not attainable by traditional silicon solar cells. To turn this ambition to a marketable product several efforts are still needed and this project aims to give relevant answers to those key challenges. GOTSolar proposes disruptive approaches for the development of highly efficient, long-lasting and environmentally safe PSCs. Metal oxide scaffolds employing perovskites and pigment materials with extraordinary high-efficient light harvesters in conjunction with solid-state HTMs will be developed and assembled together. The obtained materials will be characterized to elucidate the interplay of the mesostructure, the perovskite absorber and the HTM layer. These measurements will be used to understand the circumstances electron and/or hole collection is favourable allowing the optimization of the whole device. This understanding and the developed materials will provide the tools to push the PV performance towards 24 % efficiency for lab-size (ca. 25 mm2) and stable for 500 h under 80 °C. In parallel, lead-free light absorbers will be developed aiming a power conversion efficiency of 16 %, also in lab-size cells. These high-efficient devices will be encapsulated using a new hermetically laser assisted glass encapsulation process to enable high-durability and tested under accelerated aging conditions. Following, a device of 10 × 10 cm2 will be built and used for demonstrating the scalability of the developments for producing the first perovskite solar module with potential for 20 years of lifetime.",0,0

Since then the research activities at DEMATEN have been focused on processing and characterization of nanostructured materials: nanopowders, nanotubes, nanofilms, nanocomposites. The objectives of the proposed project are reinforcement of research potential of DEMATEN and strengthening partnerships among centres of excellence established in the EU’s convergence region, the Member States and the Western Balkan Countries (WBC). This will be realized by: i) improving networking and exchanging of know-how and experience among the countries concerned through trans-national two-way secondments of research staff; ii) sending young scientists in the EU centres for training or to carry out specific research experiments; iii) reinforcing the human potential of DEMATEN (and three research centres from the EU’s convergence region) by hiring new young researchers; iv) upgrading and renewal of S&T research equipment and v) organising of workshops and conference. Achievement of these goals should enable the research group of DEMATEN to become expert and competent in the challenging field of nanomaterials and nanotechnology, to reinforce the WBC research potential and to contribute to sustainable research development by reinforcing S&T potential.

723,193371,No,Organic Mixed Ion and Electron Conductors for High-Energy Batteries,"Energy storage is undeniably amongst the greatest societal challenges. Batteries will be key enablers but require major progress. Battery materials that promise a step-change in energy density compared with current Li-ion batteries rely on fundamentally different reactions to store charge, e.g. Si alloying or O2 reduction instead of intercalation. They have in common high volume changes on cycling and poor conductivity. For the active component of a battery electrode to function it must be simultaneously in contact with ionic and electronic pathways to electrolyte and current collector. State-of-the-art conducting additives and binders in the composite electrodes cannot ensure ideal contact for such materials and fail to exploit their full potential.  In this project I directly target these fundamental challenges of high-energy batteries by replacing now used conducting additives and binders with flexible organic mixed ion and electron conductors that follow volume changes to ensure at any stage intimate contact with ions and electrons. This requires progress with the fundamental science of such conductors, for which to achieve we develop and combine synthetic, electroanalytic and spectroscopic methods, aided by theory. Mixed conducting polymer gels, designed for the particular storage material, shall be elaborated for two ultra-high capacity electrodes, the O2 cathode and the Si anode.  The significant advantage, next to intimate contact, is that the packing density of active material can be maximized. This boosts energy stored by total electrode mass and volume by rigorously cutting the amount of non-active materials compared with current approaches. The expected overriding scientific impact includes improved understanding of mixed conductors concerning synthesis, structure, conductivity and their behaviour in the complex battery environment. This opens up new perspectives for the realm of high-capacity battery materials that demand such a breakthrough to succeed.",0,0
907,217935,No,Silver and the Origins of the Viking Age,"This project will address one of the enduring questions of medieval studies - the origins of the Viking Age (c. 750-1050 AD) - through an interdisciplinary (archaeological, archaeometric and numismatic) study of silver from early Viking-Age Scandinavia.  In doing so, it will provide the first large-scale, systematic and empirically-based answers to the outstanding questions of where, when and why the Viking Age began, casting vital new light on what is widely recognised to be a pivotal episode of cultural expansion in Eurasia.  As the only surviving physical evidence from the spoils of Viking expansion, silver has unique potential to elucidate the early development of the Viking Age. Its geographic origins can reveal where Viking activity was concentrated (Western Europe vs. Baltic/ Russia); its uses can indicate why the Vikings were prepared to risk their lives acquiring it (social vs. monetary function); and its chronology can unlock the timings of the main periods of expansion (ninth century, as widely believed, vs. a century earlier). Yet, due to its poor characterisation and the lack of scientific approaches to its study, silver has never before been harnessed to address these fundamental topics.  This project will build an entirely new dataset of the ninth-century ‘silver record’ from a combination of access to museum collections and fresh artefact and coin identifications made by the project team. We will analyse this material in new ways. First-hand archaeological and numismatic study will be combined with pioneering methods in archaeometric analysis, the enormous potential of which for revealing Viking silver sources has recently been demonstrated by the PI. The PI has negotiated unprecedented permissions from national museums to extend scientific analyses to early Viking silver objects from across Northern Europe. There is now a tremendous opportunity to transform understanding of one of Europe’s most significant cultural movements.",0,0
1022,45912,No,Development of electrically rechargeable zinc-air batteries,"PROJECT OBJECTIVES  The aim of the programmedescribed in this proposal is the development of an electrically rechargeable zinc-air battery using bifunctional air electrodes. This system stands out for its high energy density, good environmental compatibility, low cost of active materials, and wide operating temperature range (-10 C - \50 C). The goal of this programmeis to demonstrate an electrically rechargeable Zn-air battery concept having the same high specific energy figures as the mechanically rechargeable Zn-air system without requiring extra infrastructure for recharging. Compared to existing advanced batteries such as MeH-Ni, Li-ion and high temperature Na-NiCl2 (ZEBRA) or Liion systems, Zn-air shows higher energy density, good environmental compatibility, low cost of active materials and a wide range of operating temperature. Furthermore Zn-air batteries arc advantageous with respect to safety. Due to its attractive features this system is regarded as a promising candidate for use in small scale PV applications, portable electronic devices and in electric vehicles.  The goal of this programmeis to demonstrate an electrically rechargeable Zn-air battery having an energy density of approximately 150 Wh/kg. To reach this goal, significant innovations will be needed with respect to the components used in the battery  TECHNICAL APPROACH  The project consists of three major experimental parts, two of them focusing on the development of components. The third task is oriented to cell/system engineering. Component development will be focused on innovative microstructures for the zinc and the air electrode. Furthermore, new, more active catalysts will be developed for the bifunctional air electrode. A system study will find market opportunities and will determine the technical and economical requirements for Zn-air batteries as ecologically beneficial electrochemical energy storage systems.  EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION  This programmewill result in optimised materials, electrode structures, and cell designs. The cycle life will be evaluated in test-cells of practical Sizer (25 to 200 cm2). It is expected to reach more than 600 cycles and a service life of more than 3 000 h for the bifunctional electrodes. In order to increase the specific power of the systems to be investigated, advanced cell designs will be built and tested. A module having a specific power of 100 W/kg at 80 % DOD and a specific energy of 150 Wh/kg, will be demonstrated.

Despite a plethora of studies on a variety of factors and youth happiness, we do not yet grasp possible influences of teachers’ teaching methods on student happiness. This project, EduWell, aims to (i) understand the relationship between different types of classroom teaching styles and youth wellbeing, and (ii) contribute to a more nuanced approach in scientific and policy comparisons of students’ experiences and subjective evaluations of happiness across three national contexts: Japan, France, Finland. This is an important issue because, even among rich countries today (i.e. OECD members), a sizeable number of youths are unhappy in schools. The research aim (i) will be achieved by data collection and analysis (interviews/focus groups with students and teachers, classroom observations) in selected secondary schools in Tokyo, Paris, and Helsinki. Each case study has a dominant, distinctive teaching style: from more hierarchical (France) to more participatory (Finland) to hybrid (Japan), so that context-dependent youth happiness can be discerned. The research aim (ii) will be achieved with assistance from the two secondment hosts. Active in education consultancy and policy advice respectively, the two secondment hosts undertake to help exploit and communicate research outputs to curriculum planners in Finland and policy advisors in France. Lastly, this EduWell project is relevant to the Horizon 2020's work programme on 'Health, demographic change and wellbeing' (societal challenge 1). With ageing population and shrinking numbers of youth in much of the developed world, the young has to live with such consequences longer than adults. Hence, understanding their happiness at the most formative stage of growing up, and to make relevant education policy adjustments when necessary, enhance the long-term state of wellbeing of today's youth in their adulthood.'",1,1
267,222815,No,uKNEEversal: a miniaturized 3D in vitro model of human joint to gain new knowledge on Osteoarthritis pathophysiology,"uKNEEversal aims at generating a comprehensive in vitro human model of Osteoarthritis (OA) to fill lacks of existing pre-clinical tools and open perspectives to investigate OA mechanisms and therapies. Degenerative joint diseases, among which OA is the most prevalent, represent the second cause of disability worldwide. Available pharmacological options are limited and focus on the reduction of symptoms, being unable to factually reverse the pathology. One of the major obstacles towards the development of disease-reversing therapies is the gap of knowledge on OA mechanisms, linked to the lack of reliable OA pre-clinical models. Existing pre-clinical tools are currently not able to dissect OA complexity in terms of cross talks among compartments and molecular pathways affected. Although animal models may offer a complex enough model, they often fail in predicting typical human responses and recent legislation about 3R principle is pushing Pharma towards methods alternative to animals. In this regards, one ground-breaking goal in the field is the generation of an OA model able to reflect the complexity of the disease in vitro. To date, most in vitro OA models, based on traditional 2D and macroscale culture systems, are affected by sampling sites, poor scalability, and are too simplistic to recapitulate joint 3D architecture. As an alternative, human organs-on-chips (OOC) have been claimed able to transform many areas of basic research and drug development. OOC are in vitro tools that can recapitulate a human organ’s function better than traditional culture systems, in a miniaturized environment. Miniaturization has indeed showed an enhanced control leading to in vitro models recapitulating the native organ functions with accuracy hardly achievable at the macroscale. In this scenario, uKNEEversal aims at filling the gap of existing poorly predictive pre-clinical models generating an in vitro human osteoarthritic joint model through organs-on-chip technology.",0,0

366,199632,No,Reproducing Europe: Migrant Parenting and Questions of Citizenship,"This project is an anthropological study of citizenship in a Europe where the presence of migrants has increasingly come to be seen as a burden or threat. This project examines how citizenship is debated, produced and negotiated in this context. It does so through a multilevel study of debates, interventions and practices related to migrant parenting in Paris, Milan and Amsterdam. The experiences of Egyptian migrant parents – a relatively new North African and (partly) Muslim migrant group – serve as its vantage point. Migrant parenting provides a new and fertile angle to explore questions of citizenship, understood here as membership and participation in the nation. Migrant parents are frequently seen as potential threat to the reproduction of the nation, and may thus be targeted by a variety of citizenship agendas designed to ensure the proper reproduction of citizens. This research examines how migrant parents engage with such agendas. It thereby studies the intersection of 1. political debates regarding migrant parents and the nation, 2. interventions through which states regulate and shape the reproduction of citizens, and 3. everyday interactions in the context of parenting. Theoretically, this research will advance theories of citizenship through its innovative focus on migrant parenting, enabling an understanding of how correspondences between family and nation impact citizenship. It also contributes to citizenship studies through its innovative multilevel analysis, which details how citizenship is produced at the intersection of political debates, institutional interventions, and everyday interactions. Additionally, its comparative design enables an assessment of the impact of particular political debates and institutional arrangements on citizenship in Europe. This study will thereby further our understanding of the complex set of conditions that shape social life in contemporary European cities.",0,0

680,97887,No,Neural and computational determinants of left cerebral dominance in speech and language,"More than a century after Wernicke and Broca established that speech perception and production rely on temporal and prefrontal cortices of the left brain hemisphere, the biological determinants for this organization are still unknown. While functional neuroanatomy has been described in great detail, the neuroscience of language still lacks a physiologically plausible model of the neuro-computational mechanisms for coding and decoding of speech acoustic signal. We propose to fill this gap by testing the biological validity and exploring the computational implications of one promising proposal, the Asymmetric Sampling in Time theory. AST assumes that speech signals are analysed in parallel at multiple timescales and that these timescales differ between left and right cerebral hemispheres. This theory is original and provocative as it implies that a single computational difference, distinct integration windows in right and left auditory cortices could be sufficient to explain why speech is preferentially processed by the left brain, and possible even why the human brain has evolved toward such an asymmetric functional organization. Our proposal has four goals: 1/ to validate, invalidate or amend AST on the basis of physiological experiments in healthy human subjects including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and subdural electrocorticography (EcoG), 2/ to use computational modeling to probe those aspects of the theory that currently remain inaccessible to empirical testing (evaluation, assessment), 3/ to apply AST to binaural artificial hearing with cochlear implants, 4/ to test for disorders of auditory sampling in autism and dyslexia, two language neurodevelopmental pathologies in which a genetic basis implicates the physiological underpinnings of AST, and 5/ to assess potential generalisation of AST to linguistic action in the context of speech production.",0,0

A contribution to Dialogue or a factor of Conflict in transforming societies of European Countries,"Our project represents a necessary approach to address the question, how religions and values can contribute to dialogue or tension in Europe. In our project highly qualified researchers in the humanities and social sciences will cooperate in a thematic and methodological approach in order to gain better insight into how European citizens of different religious, cultural and political backgrounds can live together and enter into dialogue of mutual respect and understanding. These possibilities are to be examined in the context of educational institutions. In the context of historical development, we will concentrate on questions of religions and religious values. Differences will be studied in their impact on modern Europe and the lives of its citizens.  We plan to research empirically how differences within European societies can be taken into account without creating conflict or exclusion. Empirical studies, targeting students in the 14-16-year age group, will look into their own perceptions of dialogue or conflict within the different national contexts. These will include a dual perspective of, on the one hand, the subjects' own perspectives and, on the other hand, analyses of observed teaching in both dialogue and conflict situations. Our subject selection will also allow for gender-specific results. It is particularly from those studies we expect to gain insight into whether and how religious and value-based identity development can coexist or clash with openness for other positions.  We plan to conversely look into how, in the context of religious education in schools and universities, theoretical and practical approaches that further openness towards others and mutual respect across religious and cultural differences can be strengthened. Looking towards the future, we cannot hope to solve this task at the national level alone. A European perspective needs to be established through comparative study.",1,0

Output Indicators and Impact  Output a) See deliverables listed above; b) No of high-quality publications: the target is to publish 6 ESTO&IPTS Technical Reports and 10 issues of the IPTS Report:  2- Impact ESTO network activities are -and will be- mainly direct linked to EU RTD Policy development (including Commission strategic priorities 2001-2006 and legislation). Summary of the project  There are 3 tasks under development for the duration of the 5th Framework Programme, included within the description of this project. These are:  (a) European Science & Technology Observatory Network (ESTO) management The ESTO network (http://esto.jrc.es/) presently consists of 45 organizations that supply IPTS with up-to-date information and analysis drawn from all over the world as well as assists, informs and alerts on scientific or technological developments which may have an important socio-economic impact and potential relevance for the EU policies. Its core competence resides in prospective analysis and advice on S&T changes relevant to EU society, economy and policy;  (b) The IPTS Report The IPTS' monthly journal, The IPTS Report, is produced in English, French, German and Spanish, and in co-operation with ESTO Network - Internet (http://www.jrc.es/iptsreport). The IPTS Report articles address S/T developments and their implications, deemed prospectively relevant to EU policy-makers. Presently, there are about 6,000 printed issues distributed to subscribers to The IPTS Report. In 2001, there have been on average 40,000 visitors every month who consult the electronic version of the publication through the web site;  (c) Knowledge Management In order to implement its mission, the Institute develops awareness and cross-disciplinary knowledge skills, and build up appropriate contacts for anticipating and following the agenda of the policy decision-makers. The IPTS success is also based on its networking capabilities and the quality of its networks as enabling sources of relevant information.  To be able to develop and maintain adequate in-house knowledge and networking capabilities, the Institute is implementing the following knowledge management activities: 1) identify internal knowledge needs; 2) mapping the IPTS networks/contacts and outdoors scientific excellence/expertise; 3) develop informatics/web tools related to knowledge management.  Each and every one of the scientific support tasks included in this set fulfils a specific objective for which it has been developed. Each task has a specific and well-defined project implementation plan. Since these are support tasks to the IPTS as a whole their deliverables vary according to the specific needs. Reciprocity of working plans and methods with other JRC institutes are pursued and, whenever possible, synergy will be exploited.  Rationale  This is a horizontal project spanning all Institute programme lines. Its largest part, the ESTO Network, has the role to organise a techno-economic intelligence system, which is able to provide, through IPTS, EU institutions with timely advice concerning the development of new technologies, the likelihood of breakthroughs, the social challenges that they pose and their potential impact on policy. This includes monitoring development in the other major industrialized trading blocks to determine what lessons can be learned for anticipating and following the agenda of the policy decision-makers. The IPTS work also benefits from the development of appropriate contacts (networking capabilities), awareness and cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills. As a matter of fact, the other parts of this project facilitate, develop and optimise in different ways both the in-hose knowledge and outdoors sources of information and expertise.",0,0
563,63953,No,Logic colloquium 2003,"Logic Colloquium 2003 is the most important event in the area of logic in the world in 2003. It is the European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, the international head organization of logicians, and these meetings have become the main annual conference of top logicians, young researchers and students from all over the world. The event has tutorials aimed at students, contributed papers- and poster sessions for young researchers, high level plenary lectures and special sessions reporting on new cutting-edge research in logic. The goal is to advance mathematical logic as a multi-disciplinary branch of mathematics, philosophy, computer science and linguistics with outstanding importance for the present day society marked by information technology. The impact of logic ranges at present from theoretical mathematical study, with mainly foundational importance, to sophisticated applications in computer science, philosophy and linguistics.  In all the main areas of mathematical logic there will be keynote speakers reporting on cutting-edge new results for the wider audience of logicians and specialists alike. There will be also special sessions highlighting the most recent innovations of each area.  The most dynamic topics at the moment are: (l)Set theory: potential cofinality theory (speaker: Saharon Shelah, Jerusalem) and descriptive set theory (Matthew Foreman, Irvine); (2)Model theory: stability theory (Boris Zilber, Oxford) and finite model theory, with close links to computer science (Martin Grohe, Edinburgh); (3)Recursion theory: degrees of unsolvability (Leo Harrington, Berkeley) and effective model theory with relevance to computer science (Richard Shore, Cornell); (4)Proof theory; reductive proof theory and the higher infinity (Michael Rathjen, Leeds).  In addition there will be keynote speakers in philosophical logic, philosophy of mathematics, computer science logic and history of logic.",0,0
595,89668,No,"An integrated study on three novel regulatory hubs in megakaryocytes and platelets, discovered as risk genes for myocardial infarction by a genome-wide association and platelet systems biology study","The overarching objective of the ITN is to offer an intercalated study environment for young and talented researchers in the field of coronary artery disease (CAD) research.  12 PhD fellows operating in a unique training environment will work as a multi-disciplinary team to perform research spanning the full spectrum from basic to translational to bring novel inventions to the bedside.  The fellows will be mentored by world-leading experts to shape a new generation of European leaders in biomedical science and overcome current fragmentation in Europe.  The research is at the forefront of biomedical science because of the UK genome-wide association study in 2000 myocardial infarction (MI) patients and our EU-FP6 integrated projects Bloodomics and Cardiogenics.  We will exploit our knowledge about the genetic architecture of MI to investigate the hypothesis whether sequence variation of genes encoding network hubs poses a greater risk for network destabilisation compared to genes encoding regular nodes.  Focusing on three hub genes we postulate that genetic/bio-markers associated with hubs can be integrated in algorithms for MI/CAD risk prediction.    Success will critically depend on new developments in computing, machine learning, pattern recognition and advanced data mining and statistical analysis.  To have a free development path from basic discovery to health care improvement young scientists must be taught to cross the classic barriers between academic disciplines.  We offer a timely and necessary alternative to Europe’s classic PhD programmes by providing a seamlessly integrated multi-disciplinary environment in an academic-private sector partnership free of boundaries.      Our aim is a targeted strategy for prevention and treatment based on a better understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanism of disease. This will deliver major advances in public health and patient care, which can only be achieved if a new scientific cadre is developed.",0,0
84,108862,Yes,On the Correlation between Meta skills in Trainers and the Learning Increase in Participants of short-term  Experiential Education Programmes,"This IEF project will use a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to investigate the correlation between meta skills in Experiential and Outdoor Education (EE/OE) facilitators and the success of EE programmes (EEPs) as measured by participants and sponsors. The overall goal is to obtain more tangible information on which skills and personality attributes in educators most ideally support the development of key competencies in participants. The notion of transfer into school settings will receive particular attention in the study design. The project and IEF will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Peter Higgins and the Outdoor Education Department, University of Edinburgh, UK. The innovative feature of this project is that it is the first to investigate the impact of the factor 'human' on the learning outcome and it is expected to yield valuable insights into how to increase effectiveness and efficiency of EEPs. Also, in combination with the researcher's training, neurocognitive research methods will be implemented, which is an absolut novelty to EE/OE research and is expected to act as sign post for future investigations. EE is gaining notable weight not only in promoting social and personal competence in pupils, but also as assessment and training tool in HRM. The project aims to raise further awareness of the socio-economical value in the EE/OE approach to the commercial sector, which has a direct resale value to OEE providers as well as HRM groups in internationally acting companies and could also strengthen the European Community's competitiveness on the worldwide market. And finally, the IEF will be of great benefit to the researcher's medium and long-term career development by offering a set of unique and high quality training steps in scientific skills and general key competences that will aid her in attaining a leading research position, and thus contribute to the European Research Area by striving towards future quality research.",1,1
678,95829,No,Neural mechanisms of vocal learning: role of the basal ganglia,"Motor skills are acquired through sensorimotor learning and can be executed without awareness. Experimental evidence suggests that the acquisition and execution of motor skills rely on multiple neural networks. On one hand, the basal ganglia (BG) are necessary for the acquisition of a motor skill through sensorimotor learning, but not for its execution later on. On the other hand, premotor networks, such as cortical motor areas, are required for both the learning and execution of motor skills. The respective role of the BG and premotor networks in sensorimotor learning however remains unclear. We aim to deepen our knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition of motor skills and to understand the respective contribution of BG and premotor networks during this process. Our general hypothesis is that DA-dependent learning in the GB drive plastic vocal production during early phases of vocal learning, while extended practice allows cortical premotor networks to be “trained” by the BG output, and to become capable of driving vocal production independently of the BG. To test this hypothesis, we will set up a comprehensive theoretical model of the song system relying heavily on available physiological, anatomical and behavioral data. In this model, we will investigate possible mechanisms allowing the optimization of the vocal output through learning in the BG circuit followed by a transfer of the motor control to the premotor networks. Experimentally testable predictions of the model will be formulated in terms of activity changes in the BG and premotor networks. We will use innovative experimental techniques to test these predictions and collect further data about neural activity in the song system. In particular, we will record song-related neural activity and investigate changes in functional connectivity in the circuit in vivo in a paradigm of adult song learning.",0,0
493,88278,No,Ultrafast control of quantum systems by strong laser fields,"The objective of this project is to set up an Initial Training Network on advanced techniques for ultrafast manipulation of atoms and molecules by strong femtosecond laser pulses. The project comprises a diverse range of applications of strong-field coherent control to ultrafast spectroscopy and microscopy; nuclear and electron wavepacket dynamics; alignment of molecules with applications to collisions, high harmonic generation and adsorption; characterization and control of dissipation; stabilization of cold atoms and molecules; quantum state and process tomography; and ultrafast information processing. The use of strong shaped femtosecond laser pulses opens a novel avenue to control of quantum dynamics via hitherto inaccessible physical mechanisms. The new control scenarios require the development of novel versatile femtosecond sources in the UV and VUV range of high shaping capabilities, to which a part of the research will be dedicated, with anticipated spin-offs of great multidisciplinary interest, e.g. in chemistry and biology.  The combined expertise of the network - a joint effort of 10 universities and 3 industrial companies - represents the cutting edge of research and training in femtosecond  light-matter interactions in Europe. The network will train 18 doctoral students and about 11 young postdoctoral researchers. The training activities will combine several dedicated instruments of network-wide training, capitalizing on their synergy with a backbone of specialized training inside the groups. The training program will be adapted to the ESRs, with elementary, advanced and expert phases initiated at the network schools and workshops. Prominent scientists from Europe and overseas, and industry leaders from the companies in the network and from outside, will contribute to the schools and workshops. Special attention will be focused on developing important complementary skills, such as communication, presentation, project planning and management.",0,0
870,212696,No,From mind to mind: Investigating the cultural transmission of intergroup bias in children,"Prejudice and discrimination are pressing social problems. Across Europe, the far right is on the rise, and individuals are often discriminated against on the basis of their race, gender or sexual orientation. The origins of these problematic attitudes and behaviours appear early in development, suggesting that we are passing on our biases to our children. Yet, our knowledge of the complex psychological processes by which these biases are learned remains rudimentary. MINDTOMIND experimentally investigates how children encode, select and transmit biased social information, and so provides a framework for understanding how intergroup attitudes are perpetuated across generations.  Until now, artificial boundaries between different areas of psychology have prevented theoretical and empirical progress on this important subject. MINDTOMIND synthesizes cutting-edge research on cognitive development and experimental research on cultural transmission and intergroup psychology in order to provide a comprehensive account of this process.   The series of experiments to test the proposed framework will answer three key questions. First, how do children respond to biased information they receive from others? Second, how do children select which social information to consume? Third, how do children transmit biased information to others in their social networks?  MINDTOMIND will examine how learning, social motivation and cognitive biases interact to produce prejudice and discrimination. It will demonstrate how negative intergroup attitudes can emerge, become radicalised and spread through children’s social networks. In doing so, it will provide a step-change in our understanding of social cognitive development. In addition to far-reaching theoretical implications, this work will have broad societal implications. It will pave the way towards the development of research-led interventions that can reduce intergroup bias and thus contribute to a fairer and more egalitarian society.",0,0
966,97760,No,Novel opportunities for diagnosis and therapy of Wilson’s disease in India,"The aim of this proposal is to develop human potential in medical research and technology by joint research efforts. An ongoing research partnership for Wilson’s disease (WD) was chosen by WilsonIndia to improve joined research, knowledge and career opportunities by developing a sustained partnership of EU with India. WilsonIndia targets the highly advanced knowledge of the EU of inherited fatal WD that has recently evolved as a model for establishment of novel research strategies in medicine. The technology involved by WilsonIndia comprises DNA chip-based diagnosis and adult stem cell-based therapy of liver disease. Gained knowledge by WilsonIndia can easily be transferred to other diseases and third countries other than India. The central part of WilsonIndia comprises staff exchange of young and experienced researchers, technicians and members of SME between the EU and India. WilsonIndia attracts experts from various fields (medicine, genetics, physics, biology, SME) and will undertake a joint project to (i) study important characteristics of WD in a world wide international dimension by on-site research visits, (ii) improve and validate state-of-the-art technology for diagnosis and therapy of WD, and (iii) aggravate the transfer of highly advanced knowledge in medical sciences from the EU to other parts of the world which have a dynamic and fast growing market. WilsonIndia targets a sustained collaboration between the EU and India with respect to research and technology transfer. As a result of the proposed activities WilsonIndia expects to broaden the quality of human resources at various career levels including young and experienced researchers and SME, and to multiply ongoing technology transfer between the EU and third countries for further improvement of career development and reciprocal benefits.",0,0
1016,105429,No,EXPloiting Empirical appRoaches to Translation,"Automatic translation is an undeniable need in a globalized world where communication using several languages becomes increasingly more relevant. Translation Memory (TM) and Machine Translation (MT) systems are the two most elaborate technologies to support human translation. Recent developments in the area of Example-based and Statistical Machine Translation (EBMT and SMT), in particular, have shown the potential of data-driven approaches for producing fast and low cost translations. A number of user studies have however established shortcomings in the state-of-the-art of these technologies, including poor quality translations for low resource languages, interfaces that do not take into account user requirements and user feedback, etc. We propose the creation of an Initial Training Network to train young researchers on ways to improve current data-driven MT technologies (TM, SMT and EBMT) by exploiting their individual strengths through their combination and by addressing some of the main limitations of each of these technologies. Leading academic and industrial partners in all data-driven translation technologies, along with both professional translators and end-users of translation technologies will support young researchers of the network during the whole research and development cycle, providing guidance, core and complementary training skills and evaluating the resulting technologies. A comprehensive set of training materials on core and complementary skills developed during this project will be made freely available to other researchers interested in the field. We expect the training of researchers in the new skills required for the development and use of technologies that can increase productivity and reduce costs in the translation sector, as well as facilitate reliable communication and content creation in multiple languages, will contribute to several aspects of Europe’s ICT development.",0,0
623,92308,No,The development of a graduated radar-absorbing multi-layer structure for wind turbine applications to enable their positioning in areas of optimal power generation,"The EU is committed to generating 20% of it energy from renewable sources by 2020, and 50% by 2050. Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed ‘OSGRAM’ project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.  This will allow our SME consortium to develop world-leading RAMs, giving us global market leadership and leading to sales in excess of 80 million Euros 5 years after the project ends and increase profits across the consortium.",0,0
435,61554,No,Component BaSEd innovation NETwork,"Component-based software engineering is an approach to software systems development, which is based around the reuse of existing general-purpose software components. System implementation involves integrating these components within some framework. Although there are overlaps in partners and informal communications between research initiatives through out Europe, we believe that all existing and future projects in this area as well as potential adopters of CBSE technology could benefit from a more systematic approach to information interchange. Thus CBSEnet will be a network which aims to a) create a European-wide forum for the exchange of information between researchers and developers working in the area of CBSE; b) suggest how CBSE technologies could improve software engineering processes in different domains and to propose future research requirements for development and deployment of CBSE technologies.  Work description: The forum will not simply be a concerned with research, but will also serve as a facilitating mechanism for the transfer of advanced research and development to 'early adopters' of new CBSE technologies and methods in industry, and as a mean of informing researchers of practical industrial problems in CBSE. To illustrate the value of creating such a forum, we will draw on our own experience in current CBSE projects sponsored by the EC. In the ECO-ADM project, the project reviewers made specific suggestions that the partners should consider developing a method for eliciting requirements for component based systems. The partners agreed this. In the BANKSEC project, the development of such a method was already planned and the method specification has now been produced. If there had been more effective mechanisms for information exchange, this duplication of work would have been avoided. As highlighted by the previous example, what is needed is a 'reference place' which will constitute a research-practice active CBSE community able to collect, co-ordinate, and consolidate researches in the field. There have, of course, been a number of previous studies of the issues and problems of CBSE and high-level research issues such as problems of specifying; testing and evolving component-based systems have been identified. However, while the identification of these broad research issues is valuable, we are convinced that we need a more specific and detailed analysis of the research requirements for CBSE. The major distinction between the work that we propose and previous studies in this area is that we will assess the research requirements for CBSE from an application domain perspective.  Milestones: The network will be assessed according to the following milestones: M6 - CBSE practice questionnaire developed and deployed. M12 - Release of first reference model-based web site on CBSEM18 - Release of second reference model-based web site on CBSE. M24 - Release of landscape document.",0,0
272,98792,No,"Biophysical and structural studies on Wnt-regulatory complexes of LRP5/6, Dickkopf and Kremen","Orchestration of developmental processes as well as function and homeostasis of tissues depend on fine tuned intercellular communication, necessitating carefully controlled extracellular gradients of a wide range of signalling molecules. Signalling by the Wnt family of secretory glycolipoproteins is renowned for its crucial roles in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and is subject to a multi-layered system of regulation. Conversely, dysregulation of Wnt signalling is implicated in developmental defects, degenerative diseases, and cancer. Dickkopf (Dkk) proteins are secreted regulators of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling, which compete with the Wnt morphogens for their coreceptors LRP5 and -6. A second class of cell surface Dkk receptors, called Kremen (Krm1 and -2), amplify Dkk function by promoting cell surface expression of LRP5/6 in the absence of Dkk and inducing a rapid internalization in its presence. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the Wnt-regulatory activity of Dkk and Krm. I will use protein produced by transient secretory mammalian expression to reconstitute binary and ternary complexes of LRP5/6, Dkk, and Krm in vitro. A wide range of biophysical methods including analytical ultracentrifugation and surface plasmon resonance will be applied to characterize complex formation with respect to stoichiometry, minimal functional modules, affinity and kinetics. X-ray crystallization and electron microscopy will be used to study the structures of isolated complex components and the structural changes associated with complex formation. Based on biophysical and structural data, functional mutants of the proteins will be created and tested in a cellular setting using e.g. a Wnt-responsive bioluminescence reporter assay or confocal microscopy. By studying the interaction of LRP5/6, Dkk and Krm, I shall provide a new level of insight into the regulation of the Wnt signalling system.",0,0
776,194616,No,RESCOOPs Mobilizing European Citizens to Invest in Sustainable Energy,"RESCOOP MECISE is short for Renewable Energy Sources COOPeratives Mobilizing European Citizens to Invest in Sustainable Energy. As European citizens and local authorities often lack time, financial means and technical expertise to initiate the necessary energy renovations of their houses and public buildings, the potential for energy efficiency projects remains largely untapped. RESCOOP MECISE will develop an integrated and innovative approach that gives answer to this impeding challenge. By integrating both renewable energy and energy efficiency projects into one innovative investment scheme RESCOOP MECISE will elaborate a completely new financing format. The financing scheme will make European citizens, REScoops, local authorities, the European Investment Bank and other related investment funds partners into the transition towards a more sustainable society. Moreover RESCOOP MECISE will encourage citizens and local authorities to initiate deep energy renovation projects by providing them with personal assistance and technical expertise that now remains with the REScoops. The RESCOOP MECISE project will also provide a clear cut solution for the financing problem that REScoops face when they want to start up with their first project. By means of setting up a European fund for both renewable energy and energy efficiency projects or through the development of a financial facilitation service for REScoops the REScoop MECISE project will enhance the potential for more successful energy efficiency projects throughout Europe.",0,0
757,64007,No,ARTNOUVEAU - On the transition to the digital era of arts and culture,"The artnouveau project intends to devise new visions for the presentation of arts and culture. It will foster the exchange of information and experience between all relevant parties in arts, culture, research, and industry by establishing a working group. This working group will identify requirements and demands for innovative technological applications in arts and culture on the one hand and potentials and limits of technology in this domain on the other hand. By accompanying hands-on demonstrations of mixed reality and human-computer interaction techniques the value of its utilisation as enabling technology in the cultural and artistic context will be evaluated and the gap between the technical/industrial and the cultural/artistic community will be diminished. Finally, extensive research roadmaps dedicated to the cultural heritage domain reflecting both, the user's and the technology perspective will be developed.  Objectives: The artnouveau project aims at defining new user centred approaches to experience arts and culture in a lively, individual and user-friendly way. Public access, interaction, personalisation and education will be the key aspects of the concepts enabled through innovative technologies such as human-computer interaction, virtual and augmented reality. Current advances in theses fields will be analysed and evaluated with respect to their potential for overcoming he 'untouchable arts' paradigm. Necessary activities in all related fields will be pointed out yielding roadmaps for the CH and RTD communities. The consortium constitutes a core-working group of partners in research, industry, and cultural heritage, each providing their specific experience about the subject. Together with further associated members to be recruited relevant topics will be identified and investigated, new concepts and methods will be defined and possible research and application scenarios derived and evaluated.  Work description: The project consortium constitutes a core working group with partners from research, industry and cultural heritage. After the initial set up of the project recruiting further organisations, institutions, research projects and individuals as associated members will extend this working group. Project results will be achieved in several consecutive phases. First of all a thorough state-of-the-art analysis will be carried out. It aims at documenting the current status quo in the cultural heritage and technologies field. Existing services, products and applications as well as methods and techniques will be gathering and evaluated. This process will be rounded off by the compilation of the individual visions and needs of the respective working group members, serving as a 'user requirements' analysis for the following phases. Second, this individual vision will be merged into one common and agreed upon vision of the future directions including new methods, concepts and techniques.  Based upon the state-of-the-art analysis roadmaps for the communities involved will be devised. These roadmaps will be presented to the wide public in general but particularly to the respective communities, to be evaluated and commented on by the experts of these fields. Finally, possible research and application scenarios will be defined to support the new vision. These scenarios are intended to serve as proofs-of-concept and provide a far less abstract foundation for fertilising discussions among experts. Furthermore they directly allow first-grade hands-on experiences and experiments for a wide audience. All these actions will be escorted by diverse dissemination and exploitation activities spreading the projects' results, especially the new concepts and visions, in the various communities and spawning further worldwide activities such as novel applications, services and last but not least research projects of the future.  Milestones: MS1 - State-of-the-art analysis on cultural heritage presentations, scientific and market activities; MS2 - The new vision describing innovative concepts, methods and plans for the future; MS3 - Evaluation of the research and application scenarios derived from the new vision. The overall result will be the development of new visions and concepts, common to researchers, technicians and cultural heritage people, serving as roadmaps for the future activities of the CH and the RTD community.",0,0
500,220179,No,New Method for Early Stage Breast Cancer Detection,"Imaqen Oy is a Finnish healthcare technology company developing an imaging solution for the early detection of breast cancer. Since 2016, we have worked on our proprietary technology, Amiqo that has the same diagnostic accuracy as the key competitors, mammography and breast ultrasound, while it is non-invasive and non-radiating. Amiqo consists of an imaging device using a patented μm-wavelength scanning, a proprietary frequency analysis enhanced by AI and an anatomic map pointing out the suspect areas for diagnosis carried out by a specialist doctor. Our initial target customers are private health care clinics who already have gynecological services. They are under pressure of finding affordable solutions for preventive healthcare fueled by women’s increasing awareness of the importance of early detection. The economic effect is considerable: the operating costs are significantly lower, it enables more images taken/day and its acquisition cost is neutral or lower. The end-clients are women under 50 or over 70 who fall outside the population level mammography screenings. 50% of breast cancer cases are found in these age groups annually. For women, Amiqo examination will be less than half the price of any current alternative. Through lower mortality and decreased treatment costs, Amiqo has a direct impact at societal level as breast cancer is the most common, the deadliest and the most expensive cancer for women in Europe. The next steps involve extensive clinical testing to finalise the product design, acquire certification and attain clinical acceptance. The SMEI funding will speed up the business planning in our priority markets, Finland, Sweden, France, the UK and Spain, including IPR pipeline, clinical acceptance strategy, user and technical requirements.

182,195585,Yes,Exploring the Eastern and the Western Debate: the Case of Mathematics Teachers’ Professional Knowledge and Students’ Achievement - A Comparative Study between Germany and China,"International comparative studies (e.g., TIMSS or PISA) found that East Asian students outperformed their Western counterparts, which raised the interest in comparative studies between ‘‘Eastern’’ and ‘‘Western’’ cultures significantly. Educational policies in many countries have been revised referring to the results. However, the question how to explain students’ achievement differences referring to the professional competence of the teachers and the teaching-and-learning processes provided by them has not been in the focus of studies.  In view of this, the proposed project aims to investigate differences and similarities of mathematics teachers’ professional competence and the relation to students’ learning outcomes in Eastern and Western cultures with Germany being the Western protagonist and China serving as protagonist for Eastern cultures. Approximately 300 mathematics teachers and their students (about 8,500) in China and in Germany will participate in the study. Mathematics teachers’ professional competence will be evaluated using adapted instruments in a previous international comparative project on teachers’ knowledge (TEDS-M) and a follow-up study (TEDS-FU) through the means of web-based and video-based testing. Students’ mathematics achievements and their achievement progress over one year will be evaluated using regular achievement tests at national level in China and at Federal level in Germany. Similarities and differences of Chinese and German mathematics teachers’ professional competence and its connections to students’ mathematics achievements will be analyzed. Social and cultural influences will be further explored for a mutual understanding of the differences and similarities. Based on these results recommendations for the change of German and Chinese teacher education and teacher-in-service-training will be formulated and concrete suggestions will be disseminated broadly. Long-term collaboration with China is in planned following the fellowship",1,1

For the continuation of the Zukunftskolleg from 2012 onwards, the fellowship format will be opened up to a larger transnational dimension. For this reason, the previous fellowship scheme ends and will be substituted by two new types of incoming fellowships: • 5-year fellowships = ZIF-MC research fellowships • 2-year fellowships = ZIF-MC postdoctoral fellowships Since these two fellowship schemes are significantly different from the previous fellowship scheme, which has ended with the last call for proposals in May 2010, the ZIF-Marie-Curie programme can be considered a completely new scheme. In addition, the Zukunftskolleg will offer 5-year fellowships that are not funded through COFUND. The main objectives of the programme are (1) to attract top-level experienced researchers from outside Germany and develop mutually-beneficial long-term research cooperations; (2) to support the career development of young postdoctoral researchers from across the world by offering a creative environment for innovative research; (3) to foster dialogue and cooperation across disciplines and generations of researchers by creating a productive and supportive community among the fellows; (4) to prepare young academics to continue their careers with the best possible curriculum and research experience; and (5) to reinforce equal opportunities for all researchers.  To achieve these objectives, the Zukunftskolleg offers 48 2-year postdoctoral fellowships and 26 5-year research fellowships to excellent postdoctoral scholars who are selected on the basis of their academic track record, the quality and topicality of their research project outline, and their personal aptitude and interdisciplinary interest. During their stay at the Zukunftskolleg, they will gain academic independence and develop the disciplinary, interdisciplinary and professional skills needed to become leading experts in the international research community and decisively shape the research of the future. Thus, the Zukunftskolleg will train researchers who will advance their research fields and take up principal positions in academia and society.  Fellowship-years that exceed the timeframe of the COFUND programme will be financed from the university’s own budget.",1,0
963,212600,No,Tracking and evaluating social relations and potential partners in infancy,"In order to navigate the social world, children must understand how social interactions unfold in their society. While many recent studies have investigated how children evaluate the roles that people play in everyday interactions and what inferences they draw from their observations, to date there is no unifying account for the conceptual repertoire and computational mechanisms used by infants to analyse their social environment. Taking a new theoretical perspective on this topic, we plan to study whether and how human infants and young children are able to infer the social relations that underlie observed interactions. The theoretical background of this approach is based on the combination of two proposals: (1) that actions are analysed in terms of the costs and benefits they produce to the actors and others affected, and (2) Alan Fiske’s theory, according to which human social relations could be classified into basic elementary forms. Using a variety of behavioural and neuroimaging techniques, we intend to investigate whether children infer the specific social relation that the intentional structure and the cost-benefit outcome of an observed interaction could reveal. More specifically, while resource transfer events (e.g., giving, taking) alter the distribution of goods among participants, they may also cue certain types of underlying relations that would ensure that all parties benefit, directly or indirectly, from the exchange on the long run (e.g., by reciprocity). We aim to establish whether drawing inferences to social relations enjoys the priority in the infant mind over attribution of social dispositions, whether infants predict the outcome of new, previously unobserved interactions, what information children use to choose partners for cooperative tasks, and how they track individuals across social contexts. This research will also provide a new perspective on the development of moral psychology by extending its domain from actions to social interactions.",0,0
952,32013,No,ALLIANCE OF REMOTE INSTRUCTIONAL AUTHORING & DEVELOPMENT NETWORKS FOR EUROPE,"ARIADNE seeks to boost learner motivation and the effectiveness of learning in advanced education and training in both the business and academic worlds. The aim is to process the wealth of data confronting most learners into self-contained yet interrelated pools of knowledge, to give them a firmer focus and greater mastery of their chosen field. Tools will be developed to strengthen the content, conceptual structure and delivery of courses, including telematics applications geared to interpersonal activity in both traditional and distance learning.    How could the spreading telematics networks and computer ressources promote delocalized education and enhance its quality? Giving unlimited access to an immense document-store is not the answer, even through a worldwide-web of information highways, that can all too easily become a maze: A visitor to a large library is not expected to assimilate the contents of the few volumes that he browses through during his visit - much less so for all those other millions volumes on the shelves.  Being a difficult and often unrewarding task, learning needs to be strongly motivated and structured to have any efficiency. ARIADNE's curriculum editor aleviates the chore of providing such structure, which must be embodied in realistic socio-pedagogical scenarios and concrete curricula. These should appeal to and motivate specified sets of learners, whose work shall be organized around pedagogical knowledge pools.   Conversely, the elaboration of teaching material - books or courseware- is a time consuming process, not to speak of the redundancy stemming from the existence of numerous treatises on very similar topics. To expedite the author's task, ARIADNE will provide tools for active documents authoring and expositive material conceptual segmentation, as well as an appropriate indexation system to store and retrieve this material in the knowledgepools.   The proposed sharing and reuse mechanism will help fight redundancy.Even when followed from a distance, an effective curriculum should provide time, opportunity and possibility for person-to-person interactions, - also true for other knowledge workers such as researchers. ARIADNE intends to exploit existing Telematic solutions to incorporate this interactive component into pedagogically sound curricula and experiment whith recent high throughput links such as ATM. Most importantly, ARIADNE will seek experimental evidence   - in both academic and corporate contexts and   - in both classical and open learning situations,   that the proposed solutions are useful and acceptable to the end-users of most concern : learners and trainers, while still making economic and social sense.",1,0

The topic is important because: (i) evaluations support institutional reforms and good governance in knowledge-based societies, (ii) Europe is positioning itself as advocate of sustainable development and (iii) sustainability evaluations are different from conventional evaluations and therefore require specific training opportunities.  EASY-ECO 2005-2007 consists of 3 conferences and 4 training courses. By training young researchers hands-on, the training courses address the urgent need for sustainability evaluations and support institutional capacity building. The training courses are hosted in CEE countries because the need for sustainability evaluations is most urgent there. The conferences, all hosted in Western Europe, enhance mobility between old and new member states, support the training of young researchers and aim at scientific impact.  The training courses are based on an already develop ed blueprint: In a 3-months virtual preparation phase, young researchers are selected and effectively prepared for the 10 day training phase at the location. In the training phase they go through 8 core courses and a good practice case study. Thereby, complementary skills play an important role. Individual scientific support and networking activities are continued in a 3-months virtual follow-up phase.  The 3 conferences support the training of the young researchers by providing them with an international scientific platform, framing the series of events and helping to develop the details of the training course curricula. Scientific impact can be expected from the exchange between scientists and practitioners and the in-depth coverage of a specific topic. The topics of the 3 conferences are 'Evaluation as decision-making support', 'Evaluation as performance assessment' and 'Evaluation as learning process'.  """,1,1

We will develop a critical analysis of syllabi and schoolbooks as well as of teachers' and teachers-to-be' conceptions in order to answer to the following questions: Are there reductive simplifications in teaching issues related to our selected topics on Biology, Health and Environmental Education, like '1 gene -1 character'; '1 microbe - 1 disease' ? Do such teaching issues present or might they present notions of regulation, cycles, complexity? Are there implicit values, ideologies, in the curricula, syllabi and school textbooks? What are the teachers' systems of values, including social and affective dimensions, about nature, body and health, sexuality, biologic determinism, evolution? Are their values interacting with their scientific knowledge? differences among countries? Such differences, can they be associated to controlled parameters (gender, disciplines, religion, etc.)? This work will be largely comparative across the 19 countries involved in the project, using the same concepts and methods coming from science education, epistemology and sociology, through two approaches as much extensive as possible: Critical analysis of the selected topics in syllabi and schoolbooks of primary and secondary school as well as in teachers' training courses.

GDP to research, the EU requires no less than 700.000 new researchers before the year 2010.  The European Commission has concluded that the need to raise public awareness about the role of researchers in society and to attract more young people into scientific careers will play a central role in ensuring the availability of adequate human resources. This proposal incorporates Iceland into the 2006 Researchers' Night - a European wide awareness activity to be held on 22 September 2006.  It brings together various organizations and the media in order to achieve three main objectives: - Enhance public recognition of the role and contribution of researchers to society - Contribute to the European dimension of research and development and highlight the international dimension of researchers' careers - Encourage more young people to embark on careers in R&D and thereby contribute to the number of researchers in the European Research Area.  The project is divided into three activities; activity 0 addresses the management of the project and activity 1 animation activities leading up to the event on 22 September. Activity 2 consists of various tasks performed in the planning and implementation of a large central event on September, the 2006 Researchers' Night in Iceland, in the centre of Reykjavík.

420,223825,No,Unpacking Skills at the Cradle: A Machine Learning Approach to Construct Infant Skill Measures,"A growing body of cross-disciplinary research highlights the importance of a child’s environment in the first years of life for skill development and outcomes over the life course. This period is thought to be important for human capital accumulation both because very young children are sensitive to their environment and because deprivation during this period can have long-term consequences. Long-term follow-up studies of early childhood development (ECD) interventions to improve nutrition and create stimulating environments have found large and wide-ranging effects into adulthood: increased college attendance, employment, and earnings and reductions in teen pregnancy and criminal activity. These promising long-term effects of ECD interventions have led to calls from policy-makers and academics to develop large-scale programs that integrate ECD interventions into existing public service infrastructure. Despite this recent call to action, evidence of medium-term impacts of more recent integrated ECD intervention shows that there is substantial fade-out of short-term treatment effects. The puzzling persistence and fade-out patterns of ECD interventions requires more evidence on follow-up studies of existing ECD interventions. Of equal importance is a more detailed analysis of which early skills interventions should target to achieve medium-and long-term improvements in human capital. The proposed research agenda aims to address those concerns in two ways. First, by providing new evidence of medium-term effects on a wide range of child development outcomes of a clustered randomized controlled ECD intervention. Secondly, by developing a new methodology to measure infant skills using innovative tools from the field of machine learning. Both research projects would bring more clarity to the academic literature and policy-makers on which type of infant skills are worth investing in.",0,0
908,58083,No,JUST-in-time health emergency interventions - Training of non-professionals by Virtual Reality and advanced IT tools,"In health emergency care, effective and just-in-time interventions of on-the-field operators can reduce damages to injured citizens. Such damages can be severe and sometimes turn into permanent disabilities, causing high social costs. In most European countries, proper training of operators is still a critical issue. In traditional training, psychological impact of accident scenarios on operators is afforded in real-case situations without being tested in advance. JUST, therefore, addresses training of non-professional health emergency operators, by using advanced IT tools. The project R&D work aims to produce a Web/CD training course, with innovative, certified, multimedia content, as well as a VR-based verification tool.  The project's main goals are: (1) to complement traditional courses (2) to check operator capabilities in adopting correct decision-making procedures (3) making optimal use of advanced IT, and (4) in overcoming psychological barriers. Project results will be assessed in four pilot sites, set up in Italy, Greece, Spain, and France through clinical trials. Multi-linguality will, as a result, greatly enhance the European dimension of JUST's R&D work.  Objectives: The JUST project addresses the domain of training of non-professional health emergency operators. It aims, through the use of advanced information technologies, certified content, and innovative VR based tools, to provide advanced support for continuous education and training, and to overcome the present weaknesses.  The specific objectives of JUST are: (1) development of a Web/CD training course to support the traditional learning phase, based on the collection and/or creation of multimedia content of European relevance, (2) development of a Virtual Reality Verification Tool to check operators capabilities to: - adopt correct decision-making procedures, - make optimal use of new technological equipment, - overcome psychological barriers, (3) the design and development of advanced, adaptive user interfaces for both the interactive course and the verification tool.  There is urgent need to develop new methodological frameworks to help professionals and the citizen to access information in multiple and functionally adaptive ways.  Work description: The Project activities will be planned to take place within 7 WPs plus Project co-ordination and management. These are: (1) Analysis of content and technology, (2) Functional specifications and HCI design, (3) Development of Web/CD course, (4) Development of VR-based Verification Tool, (5) Pilot implementation, (6) Assessment & Evaluation, and (7) Dissemination & Implementation.  The main target group consists of non-professional health emergency operators (i.e. mainly volunteers). Ultimately the target group for the JUST product is the European citizen. As a result, the project will pay due attention to the multi-lingual aspects and requirements. A User Group will be set up, consisting of recognised experts from traditional training course providers. Collection of European recommendations / guidelines on health emergency protocols of intervention will provide the basis for fully analysing education and training needs of the selected user groups. The target user groups will be studied in order to identify the preferred interaction patterns with different platforms. User profiles will be elicited to obtain an understanding of their requirements, skills and preferences, and interests. Context analysis will be performed seeking to obtain a global understanding f how the envisioned environment and provisioned respective systems are going to be used. Usability Context Analysis and Design space analysis will be employed to identify prime user groups, contexts of use, candidate platforms, likely scenarios of use, alternative interaction artefacts and dialogue style. An interactive multimedia medical courseware product will be developed with emphasis on interface effectiveness and adopted training and communication strategies; training objectives will not only be limited to the transfer of basic facts and rules, but with emphasis on advanced animation audiovisuals. Emphasis will be on tight integration of the Web and CD platforms, since user-friendliness.  Milestones: The Project will last 3 years. The major milestones (results) will be: - Description of state-of-the-art in health emergency training, VR-based training and Web/CD based training - Specifications of products and scenarios (incl. HCI & localisation issues) - Prototypes and final releases of products - Design & results of validation at pilot sites (clinical trials) - Assessment and evaluation reports -A product exploitation plan.",0,0
81,16507,Yes,The Multimedia TeleSchool for European personel development,"Purpose   The Multimedia Teleschool (MTS) project addresses the current market for realistic distance learning systems, based on an optimal mix of telecommunication-based learning and tutoring. The market for personnel-development training and formation, in particular, is estimated at DM 27 Billion in Europe. This underlines the importance of a future European Training Network for distance learning in this area. The Multimedia Teleschool is one step towards this goal. Under its auspices, the MTS brings together the learners from different European countries and companies. Course and Technology Providers, and the Project Management.   The MTS which is based on telecommunication technologies creates 'Virtual Study Centres', and 'Real Life Training' for learners and tutors of European companies. The enormous demand for personnel development training on a European level can only be met by the installation, delivery and use of distance learning courses based on Advanced Learning Technologies. The MTS project will be an important milestone in examining/testing the efficiency and the advantages of multimedia and interactive courses based on telecommunication technologies.  The project adapted a variety of courses for delivery by telecommunications to more than 1400 learners in 60 companies and institutions involving nearly 80 sites. The project developed considerable expertise, both technical and educational, in the use of interactive television and computer conferencing which could lead to establishing a flexible structure for marketing, implementation and delivery of European level teletraining services even to very remote locations.  The evaluation has shown that learners have very individual styles of arranging their leisure time as well as their pace, contents and learning modes. The MTS technologies opened up possibilities of individualising the training according to the special needs and organisational circumstances of the learners. Another key finding was that the interaction between learner and tutor was central to the teletraining process. Approach   Distance Learning Courses and Learning Environment   The project develops, implements and evaluates real-life, large scale pilot schemes. These are based on adaptations of proven distance learning courses and incorporate tutors working for existing distance learning institutes, and real learners provided by large and medium companies throughout Europe (as sponsoring partners). Six courses are adapted for new technologies and delivered to over 1600 learners in eight European countries (Belgium, England, France, Germany, Greece, Spain and Sweden). The telecommunication technology (PSDN) and satellite transmission utilised can also reach learners in Eastern-Europe - even the Baltic States and Russia which might be important in the near future. Cross-border communication between tutor and learners demonstrates the European dimension and strengthens the idea of European integration.   System Environment   The Multimedia Teleschool concept is based on an optimal mix of self-study learning, telecom facilities for cooperative learning, on-line tutor support and broadcast Live-Training Sessions. The major innovative aspect is the full integration of self-study material and on-line distance learning, realised by coupling to PSDN and ISDN, with substantial usage of DBS and videoconferencing (compressed video).   16 one-hour live broadcasts - focusing on the range of topics contained in the two Berlitz distance learning courses 'English for Banking' and 'English for Telecommunications' - are being broadcast throughout Europe over a period of nine months by ARTE, Europe's new cultural channel. A large number of employees of European enterprises - in Germany, France, Spain and Greece - are taking part in these courses. Using PCs at their workplaces they make contributions during the live broadcasts, putting questions to the experts being interviewed, and answering questions by the tutors in the studio. During the live broadcasts, the experts in the studio discuss a wide range of topics. All the experts work for European companies. They share their knowledge and skills with the course participants - primarily those in the new German Federal States, France, Spain and Greece. The concept of a group of experts making presentations on specialized topics to an audience of a few hundred who can 'tap into' the broadcasts in v rious ways, represents a sizable contribution to tackling the major challenges facing European personnel development in the future.   The majority of DBS transmission hours will be devoted to live-training sessions integrating PSDN and ISDN based feedback links between tutors/experts and learners. Real-time interactivity as a DBS component is an important feature of this project.   The technical infrastructure for cooperative learning and tutor support is also utilised for monitoring and management purposes, thus evaluating all real-life aspects. The necessary tools are developed by the project partners, in addition to the actual technical implementation of integrated infrastructures. The MTS project aims at gaining experience in managing the European Training Network and responding to the increasing market demand for distance learning courses.   Output/Impact   The MTS Project opens up huge opportunities for truly effective distance learning, from an organisational, pedagogical and technical perspective. These three dimensions will be evaluated extensively in all pilot schemes and cover all aspects that are relevant for real market uptake: installation and operation of the infrastructures, adaptation of existing course materials, acceptance by tutors and learners of the new systems, continuous support, cost-benefit-analysis and implementation strategies of the sponsoring partners (companies all over Europe).   The assessment will provide input both internally and externally to the project. Internally, formative evaluation results play an important role for subsequent development work and revisions within the different cycles of the project. Externally, 'summative evaluation' results will be made available to the DELTA community through workshops and reports. In order to achieve a high degree of dissemination, a Handbook for Personnel Development Departments and Distance Learning Institutes on developing, installing, and implementing telecommunication based distance learning courses is planned.",1,1

Harmonization and standardization of the various methodologies of ocular fluorometry, through the coordination of the participating centers to enable direct comparisons of results and make them available into a common data base. The group that will carry out this work will be designated European Clinical Network of Ocular Fluorometry (ECNOF).   Development of sophisticated target-oriented instrumentation and systems as this would increase the potential of fluorometry for both endogenous and exogenous fluorophores. More specifically the need to enhance special resolution and improve spectral resolution was identified.   Identification of appropriate fluorophores and definition of directions for instrumentation and development.  The project has been set up to harmonize and standardize the various methodologies of ocular fluorometry, through the coordination of the participating centers to enable direct comparisons of results and make them available into a common data base. The group has been designated the European Clinical Network of Ocular Fluorometry (ECNOF). The achievements are as follows: agreement on common protocols for patient examination and data gathering; development of standardized methods, calibration procedures and protocols for the determination of several parameters using ocular fluorometry; development and testing of specially designed software for 3 main areas of clinical measurement: anterior segment, lens, and blood retinal barrier; establishment of adatabase of normal values for the different ocular fluorometry tests; demonstration that ocular fluorometry measurements may be performed reliably and in a reproducible manner in different centers; publication of a manual of ocular fluorometry; first steps of an atlas of ocular fluorophores; prototype development and comparisons with available instrumentation in the area of light scattering measurements in the aqueous, cornea and lens; evaluation of the possibilities offered by spectral analysis of the native fluorescence of the cornea, lens and retina; demonstration of the immediate clinical interest of measurements of corneal and lens fluorescence, particularly in diabetic patients; a simple, totally noninvasive procedure for measuring corneal fluorescence may become a retinopathy screening in diabetic patients; prototype development directed to improve axial resolution led to the conclusion that a target oriented modification of existing confocal scanning ophthalmoscope is the best option to improve axial resolution for the purpose of ocular fluorometry measurements. Methodology Used   Coordination and cooperation between different centers was considered necessary in order to : 1) pool data, particularly from a normal population; 2) to integrate research progress; 3) to establish task groups on selected areas of instrumentation development; 4) to establish an European database on Ocular Fluorometry.   The objectives of the Clinical Component were achieved by general meetings, definition of protocols, design of multicenter studies, development and distribution of softwares, establishment of communication channels and small training workshops. Three specific areas, using specific software, were identified: anterior segment, lens and blood-retinal barrier. Each one of these clinical areas had a Coordinating Center (Leiden, Coimbra and Copenhagen, respectively).   The objectives of the Bioengineering component were achieved through workshops, participation in the general meetings to establish interchange between biologists, medical people and engineers, transfer and exchange of equipment and exchange of research workers between the centers that were involved in prototype development. In order to coordinate efforts four tasks were finally established in this area:   1. Development of an Atlas of Ocular Fluorophores.  2. Light Scattering Measurements in the Ocular Tissues and Fluids.  3. Spectral Fluorescence Analysis of Ocular Tissues.  4.

This goal will be the first effort of a European research network composed by 11 countries member of the European Economic Community. The main function of this network is to facilitate and coordinate the development, conduct, analysis, and reporting of Randomised Actively Controlled Clinical Trials (RACCT), in which all arms of the study receive active treatment with approved drugs.  Brief description:  The pediatric rheumatic diseases (PRD) are rare conditions, associated with substantial morbidity, and monetary costs. Drugs for the treatment of PRD are now being used in new dosages, new routes of administration, new combinations and for disease complications. There is little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund large-scale trials of these new approaches. Consequently, data regarding the safety and efficacy of these treatment regimens tends to be from anedoctal, small, uncontrolled, non-randomised case series. Moreover, the ethics and effectiveness of conducting any placebo-controlled trial, even in adults has recently come under intense debate. This network will undertake only those studies which are not fundable through pharmaceutical industry or other sources. Each trial will be designed to build on the current 'standard of care' in such a way that the cost of the medications, clinic visits, and laboratory monitoring, will be paid by the usual method for clinical care in each participating European State. The amount of data to be collected for these trials, in addition to that obtained for routine follow-up, will be minimal, and all participants will volunteer the effort. Importantly, studies of rare conditions or complications of disease in which patient recruitment may have to be extended over several years, would become possible. Work content: a) A RACCT in children with juvenile chronic arthritis: parenteral methotrexate in low versus higher doses.$Lb) Cross-cultural adaptation, and validation, in up to 11 European countries of two health related quality of life instruments: the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Childhood Health Questionnaire.$Lc) Development of a centralized computerized databank designed to be used as an international resource for the pediatric rheumatology community.$LMethodology: The approach taken in this project is fashioned after that of the Pediatric Oncology Group. The proposed trial, and nearly all future studies, would be considered appropriate for consideration by the network only if: 1) the new therapeutic approach is deemed to have legitimate promise of being effective and safe; 2) the trial will not be fundable by conventional means (i.e. pharmaceutical industry); and 3) the usual method of cost reimbursement for clinical care will bear the patient-related expenses. It is anticipated that most trials will be RACCT studies. Personnel at the coordinating centre, will assist principal investigators in protocol development, and provide the expertise and equipment to initiate the trial recruit subjects, gather and analyze data and report results.$L$LKeywords:$LJuvenile Chronic Arthritis, Methotrexate, Quality of Life, Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial.",0,0

Universities and science centres will cooperate in the project using the expertise they have in linking formal land informal learning. For a long term effect the project focusses on teacher training. Each partner will form a Community of Learners in which teachers work together with formal education experts and informal education experts. The topics they will work on are derived from cutting edge research taking place at the partners’ university. Researchers and people from industry will complement the Community of Learners.  The Community of Learners will develop material to be used both in the classroom as well as in the science centres. During the first part content knowledge about the research will be introduced using the well established IBSE methodology. In the second part students will discuss and work on Responsible Research and Innovation issues regarding the research they have studied. Each partner will develop one module to be used in the classroom During the module students will be developing exhibits about the RRI issues that they have studied. These exhibits will be presented in the science centres.The best exhibits from each partner will be brought together during the yearly conferences of the project. By using new techniques like digital fabrication (ie. 3D printing) the exchange of exhibits will be easy between partners. In the second round of the project the teachers from the first Community of Learners will work in a new Community with 4 to 5 new teachers. They will help these teachers introduce the developed modules in their own classroom. This way the number of teachers involved grows. After receiving feedback from the first two rounds the 10 modules will be published and disseminated using www.scientix.eu and through workshops at local and (inter)national conferences,1,1
427,216356,No,Cyprus Center for Algorithmic Transparency,"Despite strong indications that Cyprus is now in stable economic recovery, and that the island boasts one of the highest rates of tertiary educational attainment in Europe, the picture painted regarding the level of digital skills among citizens is a dismal one. In the 2017 Digital Economy and Society Index, Cyprus ranked 22nd within the EU, and belongs to the cluster of low performing countries. These findings are particularly worrying in light of the rapid changes taking place in the information landscape, such as the global consolidation of networked information services, and the rise of proprietary algorithmic processes that mediate citizens’ access to information and opportunities. The project will establish a network of researchers with key expertise in the areas of informatics and algorithmic biases, enhancing the Cyprus Center for Algorithmic Transparency, a research center at the Open University of Cyprus (OUC). CyCAT will become the regional expert in issues of information access in light of algorithmic gatekeeping, working with local authorities, librarians and educators to promote algorithmic transparency and enhanced digital literacy skills. Expected outcomes are 1) raising the international profile of the OUC researchers as evidenced by invitations to serve on committees, editorial boards, invited talks; 2) increased output in terms of number and quality of publications of OUC researchers; 3) attraction of additional external research funds to sustain CyCAT. Expected broader impacts include: 1) creation of digital artifacts through showcase projects that are relevant to Cypriots’ information needs and that can help raise awareness of algorithmic bias in the systems they routinely use; 2) educational materials based on CyCAT scientific outputs, that can be used by librarians and teachers; 3) increased opportunities for young researchers engaged with CyCAT; 4) increased dialogue on the importance of digital skills.",1,0

The work can be divided into the following elements:  development of a prototype computer based training programme based on HECTOR results;  representation of HECTOR's framework of reference in a computer based knowledge base;  development of a training course and material for France, Spain and Germany;  field trials of the 3 working streams.  Existing methods and tools for information system development are incomplete, poorly integrated, often ineffective, and typically insensitive to the application environments. The purpose of the harmonized European concepts and tools for organizational information systems (HECTOR) project was to determine what was needed in the European marketplace, where the opportunities lay to better meet these needs, and to present a framework within which these issues could be studied. This led to the following phased objectives: establishment of framework to characterize existing system development methods and tools; use of this framework to describe existing methods and tools; determination of the extent to which these are inadequate for system improvement projects; identification of the requirements for integrated methods and tools; recommendation of a way of improving the selection of system development approaches.  The HECTOR project has developed a reference framework which provides a solid basis for the harmonization of terminologies. A market survey undertaken during the project has provided an up to date assessment of the recent and potential uses of methods and tools. The research has highlighted the extent of the confusion, with a vast range of methods and tools in use, and a high degree of user dissatisfaction with current methods and tools. HECTOR has mapped out the opportunities for further development on a national as well as a European basis from the market point of view. The project's results can provide interested organizations with: recommendations for the development of future methods and tools; improvements to existing methods and tools; appropriate ways for the future market diffusion of methods and tools. This led to the following phased objectives:   - establish a framework to characterise existing system development methods and tools  - use this framework to describe existing methods and tools  - determine the extent to which these are inadequate for system improvement projects  - identify the requirements for integrated methods and tools  - recommend a way of improving the selection of system development approaches.",1,0

989,109655,No,Hierarchical Self Assembly of Polymeric Soft Systems,"'The production of the next generation of functional soft systems and materials capable of meeting the current and future demands of society in a sustainable manner will require both new technologies and highly trained scientists. Supramolecular chemistry provides a powerful approach to develop new self-assembled materials with emerging properties, such as healability, recyclability and facile processability. The SASSYPOL ITN will train the next generation of European scientists with the skills necessary to overcome such future demands and simultaneously develop new strategies for the preparation of hierarchically self-assembled polymeric soft systems, which greatly impact important fields such as biomedicine, energy, composite materials and sensing. The ITN unites many leading experts in the areas of supramolecular and polymer chemistry with partners from the industrial sector. Expertise of all partners encompasses the general areas of non-covalent chemistry, with individual research competencies focusing on a number of specific themes including liquid crystalline materials, hydrogen-bonded supramolecules, molecular systems based on host-guest interactions, and advanced modeling and characterisation techniques of complex polymeric and self-assembled materials. The complementarity and diversity realised in synthesis, analysis, and applications is crucial for successful research and training in this area. A number of partners from the private sector will extend the fellows’ training beyond that of traditional academic settings −they will have the critical role of bridging fundamental science with application and commercialisation of the results. Indeed, SupraPolix (a SME), one of SASSYPOL’s industrial full partners is a perfect example of the commercialisation of cutting-edge science initially developed at an academic laboratory. Our activities will thus possess both breadth and quality that can only be achieved through an interdisciplinary pan-European effort.'",0,0
375,100186,No,Aeronautics and air transport European Research Agenda - Promotion,"Two important milestones of special relevance to aeronautics and air transport research are planned in a near future: - the release in Spring 2011 by a High Level Research Vision Group of a Vision for Aeronautics and Air Transport beyond 2020 and towards 2050 - the development of a strategic research agenda (SRA) based on this Vision through the involvement and consultation of all major Aeronautics and Air Transport stakeholders via the NEARS (New European Aviation Research Strategy) FP7 project. This strategic research agenda which will outline the main threads of technical/operational/strategic actions to achieve the fulfillment of the Vision is scheduled to be released during the Spring 2012. Limited dissemination activities are scheduled to take place during the NEARS project and therefore there is a great opportunity to raise the profile of this research-intensive sector by orchestrating a dissemination campaign matching the expectations of transforming the strategic research agenda into a well known reference document for all the Aeronautics and Air Transport Stakeholders and beyond. The scope of this dissemination campaign should cover as extensively as possible all the European Member States, promote the image of the European Research in this sector on a global scale and use the best in class communication means to address audiences which are usually more difficult to reach (e.g. the SMEs and East European Countries). The new agenda will be the focus for future aeronautics and air transport research, on the European level as well as for national and industrial programmes. The aim is to ensure that, in times of unpredicted challenges and limited resources, mobility needs of the European citizen are satisfied safely and more sustainably, and that Europe continues to maintain its leading position at the forefront of research. Tailoring a dissemination campaign around the new agenda to maximize its impact is therefore contributing to this overarching objective.",0,0
685,8379,No,Metrics Education Toolkit,"The main aim of this project was to accelerate the transfer of results on software metrics into the industrial workplace by providing enhanced tools for the education of current and future software engineers, managers, students, technicians and other types of practitioners. The metrics educational toolkit project (METKIT) promotes the use of software engineering measurement in industry by producing educational material for both industrial and academic audiences. An educational package intended for use within academia has been described. A preliminary survey of academics lead to the specification of a modular course, mainly teacher mediated but with some self study material. The detailed structure of the modular system is available.  The main aim of the project was to accelerate the transfer of results on software metrics into the industrial workplace by providing enhanced tools for the education of current and future software engineers, managers, students, technicians and other types of practitioners. A further objective was to produce a metrics educational toolkit.  In the first phase of the project, current industrial and academic practice, and needs in the application of software quality and productivity measurement and metrics have been identified, and associated training requirements have been determined. The range of educational technologies suitable for use in software measurement and metrics training activities has been investigated, and an emphasis has been set on teacher mediated training methods. Computer aided learning and video systems are also being developed. Design, implementation and test of courseware and computer based tools to teach software quality and productivity measurement and metrics have been performed. Training versions of existing metrics tools have been developed and case studies based on data from actual industrial projects implemented. A formal evaluation of the tools has led to a number of enhancements, both to individual packages and to the unity of the material. The objective of METKIT was to produce a metrics educational toolkit capitalising on the results of ESPRIT and other national and international projects. This toolkit would be modular in nature, with the component modules supported in a multimedia educational environment including the use of computer-aided learning and video, as well as a wide range of the more conventional educational techniques (slides, overheads, text books, etc).

990,57771,No,Virtual Environments for the Training of Visually Impaired,"The ENORASI project aims at developing a highly interactive and extensible virtual reality system that will allow visually impaired people, especially those blind from birth, to study and interact with various virtual objects. ENORASI will not only introduce techniques for the training of blind people based on their haptic interaction with virtual objects, but will also provide case studies for their training through interaction, manipulation and modification of objects of complex shapes. An immersive haptic virtual environment (VE) will be created, simulating the real world guiding them through all the phrases of the training procedure. The ENORASI project introduces completely innovative non-visual virtual reality techniques that will help training blind people into feeling, understanding and interacting with complex virtual objects (airplanes, buildings, 3D maps, famous archaeological findings, etc.)  Objectives: The project's technological objectives include development, testing, and evaluation of new approaches that will serve the project purposes.  These include: - Development of a high sensitivity virtual reality haptic system for training. - Development of novel virtual intelligent agents guiding blind humans and consulting them when interacting with the virtual objects, in the way that real guides would. - Development of a metadata schema for efficient representation of texture. - Development of realistic 3D rendering systems.

934,101452,No,"Development of a selective, green solvent-based recovery process for waste polystyrene and polycarbonate","Expanded polystyrene is widely used as packaging for foodstuffs and for shipping. Several hundred thousand tonnes of polystyrene are sent unnecessarily to landfill every year in the UK and Europe, where it does not biodegrade but persists for hundreds of years. Meanwhile,  oil-derived feedstocks are being consumed in the production of new polystyrene. Recycling systems for polystyrene are underdeveloped compared to those in existence for many other plastics, owing to the unfavourable economics of collecting and recycling low density material. The proposed project will develop a new process by which an environmentally friendly and selective solvent is used to dissolve and recycle polystyrene waste into a highpurity product comparable to virgin material. A novel thermoplastic recovery system will be developed and integrated within a modular, scalable recycling process. This will facilitate: • Reduced pressure on oil feedstocks for virgin polystyrene production • High value-added product manufactured from effectively zero-value waste, to be sold by the end user The technology will build on the success already achieved under the UK TSB-funded “HiPerPol” project, whereby solvent-based systems have been developed for the selective separation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) from mixed plastic waste streams. The extension of the technology to polystyrene and polycarbonate will greatly increase the capability of this technology to deal with the high volumes of mixed polymer waste, whereby individual polymers can be separated and recycled at a far higher degree of purity (and consequently value) than is currently possible.  The process can also be extended to other thermoplastics.",0,0
861,202781,No,Attention and memory components in every-day cognitive problems in aging,"Older individuals experience problems in many every-day tasks, due to age-related decline in cognitive functions. Cognitive frailty is a societal and economical challenge, as it affects elderly’s quality of life and need for care. To understand, and counteract, cognitive difficulties, we need to be able to measure them. Basic research has revealed essential knowledge on age-related cognitive and neuronal changes. However, the correlation between laboratory task performance, brain alterations, and experienced difficulties in daily life is imperfect. In the realms of attention and memory, the problem may lie in the tasks we use. Most laboratory tasks are made of brief trial structures, which is useful to isolate specific process components. Real world tasks, while built of smaller components, are complex and extend over time. This project presents a multi-method neuro-cognitive approach to unravel sources of older individuals’ deficit. The research is based on leading theoretical models and includes behavioral data modeling, eye-movement and EEG data analyses. At my TC host, Wolfe’s Visual Attention Lab (Harvard Medical School), we will create new extended hybrid search and foraging tasks that enable us not only to look at the small components, but also to analyze how they interact over time, and how they relate to age-specific daily problems. At Bundesen’s Center for Visual Cognition (University of Copenhagen), the new knowledge will be integrated into the computational “Theory of Visual Attention” framework and the model-based assessment procedure. Our aim is to advance the theoretical knowledge about attention and memory and improve cognitive assessment products. Commercialization of the newly developed tests will be exploited together with the industrial partner Cambridge Cognition, a company producing cognitive assessment tools. The outcome will be relevant to the development of technology, products, and strategies to meet the needs of our aging population.",0,0
305,92280,No,Actuation of Ferromagnetic Fibre Networks to improve Implant Longevity,"This proposal is for an exploratory study into a radical new approach to the problem of orthopaedic implant loosening. Such loosening commonly occurs because the joint between the implant and the surrounding bone is insufficiently strong and durable. It is a serious problem both for implants cemented to the bone and for those dependent on bone in-growth into a rough/porous implant surface. In the latter case, the main problem is commonly that bone in-growth is insufficiently rapid or deep for a strong bond to be established. The idea proposed in this work is that the implant should have a highly porous surface layer, made by bonding ferromagnetic fibres together, into which bone tissue growth would occur. During the post-operative period, application of a magnetic field will cause the fibre network to deform elastically, as individual fibres tend to align with the field. This will impose strains on the bone tissue as it grows into the fibre network. Such mechanical deformation is known to be highly beneficial in promoting bone growth, providing the associated strain lies in a certain range (~0.1%). Preliminary work, involving both model development and experimental studies on the effect of magnetic fields on fibre networks, has suggested that beneficial therapeutic effects can be induced using field strengths no greater than those already employed for diagnostic purposes. A comprehensive 5-year, highly inter-disciplinary programme is planned, encompassing processing, network architecture characterisation, magneto-mechanical response investigations, various modelling activities and systematic in vitro experimentation to establish whether magneto-mechanical Actuation of Ferromagnetic Fibre Networks shows promise as a new therapeutic approach to improve implant longevity.",0,0

This particular field of interdisciplinary investigations originates from the methodology of theoretical physics which is a traditional subject of interest to the members of the Jagellonian University Complex Systems Research Centre. Members of the Centre have a long record of successful collaboration with other European research organisation carried out mostly during visits of Polish researchers to their European partners.  The Centre now intends to become an internationally recognised unit, attractive to foreign senior researchers an offering temporary postdoctoral positions to graduates of European universities. The senior visitors and postdoctoral researchers should bring to the Centre new ideas and methods as well as the expertise on particular areas of study. The proposal includes study and modelling of natural and human-created networks, quantum information, soft matter and ecosystems.  While these subjects appear to be inhomogeneous, they share common mathematical formalism and computational methods. Therefore, the feasibility of the project is well founded on the expertise of the Centre. Mathematical and computational tools needed to carry out the proposed research are strong points of the group, but as this Centre strives to maintain and further develop its high research profile, an influx of fresh ideas and instruction on newly developed techniques are required.  Industrial applications of several systems studied at the Centre during the lifetime of this project appears feasible.

756,58965,No,Looking for new targets for anti-epileptic terapy : focus on presynaptic glutamate receptor complexes (EPILEPTOSOME),"The brain neurotransmitter, glutamate, has been implicated in neurological diseases (e.g. epilepsy and neurodegeneration). Its kainite and mogul receptors promote and suppress epileptic seizures, respectively. Nevertheless, all the compounds that have been developed so far to act directly on these receptors have been unsuccessful in clinical trials. Therefore new therapeutic targets and strategies are needed. A general rule is that neurotransrnitter receptors interact with other proteins to form functional complexes. This also applies to kainite andmGlu7 receptors. Such protein-protein interactions stabilise these receptors atpresynaptic sites to control the release of glutamate. The goal of the present project is to identify the nature and role of presynaptic kainite and mGlu7receptor interacting proteins in the development of epileptic seizures. Drugs acting on these proteins will be screened for their anti-epileptic properties.",0,0

Test the feasibility to implement pressure indicators over European landscapes; 3 To make available JRC's expertise and competence when further research is needed for understanding the linkages between agriculture and the environment in particular for the spatial component. To provide access to scientific and technical references for agri/environmental geo-spatial databases (in particular, further development of the pan-European river and catchment DataBase in support to environmental reporting activities of DG Env and EEA).

Expressions of interest within the thematic area of the action have been submitted); 3.3. GIS layer: version 2.0 of the 1:250K River and Catchment DB with associated report. Summary of the Action:  This activity deals with the provision of expertise, techniques and tools for assessing, quantifying and monitoring the evolution of agri-environmental conditions. The activity will focus on the spatial dimension (i.e. integration of geographical information, mapping, spatial analysis, elaboration and provision of basic layer geographical data sets) in particular to develop indicators to assess the integration of environmental concern into the agricultural policy. The challenge to monitoring this integration is to meet the objectives of providing information on the current state and changes in the conditions of the environment in agriculture; and using indicators for policy definition, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and also for scenario development.  This requires improving the analytical soundness and measurability of tools, especially by overcoming conceptual and data deficiencies, matters of threshold values, and providing a better interpretation of trends in space and time. This should contribute to understanding the linkages between agriculture and environment and to examining the synergies and trade-offs to implement the environmental dimension of a sustainable agriculture. Rationale The horizontal integration of sectoral policies, such as environmental, agricultural or those relating to rural development, is one of the most important future challenges towards sustainable agriculture and sustainable development in the European Union. Several European Councils reaffirmed the commitments to consider the environmental concern in all Community policies and invited all relevant institutions to develop adequate strategies. In COM 1999 (22) 'Directions towards Sustainable Agriculture' (EC 1999) the European Commission acknowledges the pressure agriculture places on the environment due to technological developments and commercial considerations, which have given rise to a market intensification in the last 40 years. Moreover, the role of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as one of the major drivers contributing to the intensification is recognised. However, the European Commission recognises also the environmental significance of agriculture and outlines 'the fundamental basis for the European Agricultural model, comprising a multifunctional agriculture sector and the part it plays in the economy and the environment, in society and in preserving the landscape' (Agenda 2000). Within the development towards sustainable and multifunctional agriculture, particular importance is given to the development of agri-environmental indicators.  As outlined in COM 2000 (20) 'Indicators for the Integration of Environmental Concerns into the Common Agricultural Policy' the indicators can help to provide information for decision-makers and the general public. They permit to identify the key agri-environmental issues that are of concern in Europe today, to understand, monitor and evaluate the relationship between agricultural practices and their beneficial and harmful environmental effects, to assess the extent to which agricultural policies respond to the need to promote environmentally friendly agriculture and to communicate this to policymakers and the wider public and to map and to monitor the diversity of agri-ecosystems in the European Union and Candidate Countries. This has particular relevance in explaining to the EU's trading partners the specificity of the farmed environment in Europe. These requirements call for major scientific efforts on a European level, in which both interdisciplinary research and coverage of all Europe, including the accession countries, are included to develop a sounds basis for future land development strategies in order to improve the quality of life, maintain the public goods and ensure sustainable development.",0,0

710,42232,No,Characterization of a novel resorbable bone cement for clinical applications,"Research objectives and content  The main objective is to develop a new biocompatible amorphous calcium phosphate bone cement with fast bone transformation rate. It is known that amorphous materials dissolve faster under in vivo conditions and ingrowth of new bone may also take place faster.  Our experience in the development and characterization of x-Tricalcium Phosphate (x-TCP) based calcium phosphate bone cements, gained during my PhD Thesis, allows to foresee a good potential for these ideas. At present, the physicochemical mechanisms controlling the setting and hardening properties of these cements are well understood. Moreover, the stability and in vivo behaviour of these cements are correlated with these mechanisms. The resulting ideas suggest that it is possible to control the in vivo behaviour of this kind of cements by the modification of some control factors affecting the powder phase, the liquid phase or the mixture. These seems to be a good possibility to modify the rate of resorption of these cements as well as the rate of new bone formation by adding some additives to the original x-TCP powder. From a previous study we know that one of these additives produces amorphous calcium phosphate cements. It will be important to study the resorption rates of the new formulations in vitro and in vivo as well as the osteoclastic and osteoblastic answers of the bone tissue around the implant. Training content (objective. benefit and expected impact)  It should be pointed out that the possibility to use a wide range of very sophisticated techniques all of them available, in the same centre will be of enormous interest. The possibility to perform cell culture tests as a biological feed-back, for the physical and chemical development of the cement has a paramount relevance. It will be possible to optimize [ the product from all the important points of vue at the same time. The benefits will not only be personal, but the [ whole research group in Barcelona will profit of such training at my return. A great impact of the project is expected [ since the development of amorphous fast resorbable bone cements with a great capacity of stimulating bone apposition is a goal that may be of enormous interest in traumatology, odontology and orthopaedics.

Emerging early in development and resulting in long-term disability, neurodevelopmental dysfunctions (NDD) compromise the quality of life of millions of Europeans. The purpose of the Neo-PRISM-C ETN is (1) to train Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in applying the Research Domain Criteria, a novel framework for understanding psychopathology, to the study of the mechanisms and treatments of NDD. It aims (2) to train ESRs from multiple disciplines (psychology, neuroscience, data science) in state-of-the-art and transferable skills for innovating the study of brain-behavior relationships in NDD, in the context of a systems-based, trans-diagnostic theoretical frame. This ETN will also (3) support training in designing evidence-based, individualized treatments of learning, behavioral, and social maladjustment, bridging across diagnostic categories. Towards these goals, we have assembled a trans-sectoral European network with expertise in cognitive, social, educational, clinical, and emotion research and in training ESRs. Six research, training and management work packages (WPs) pursue these goals. WP1 comprises innovative projects, investigating risk and protective factors that span across NDD diagnostic categories (autism, learning, emotional difficulties) and linking to healthcare industry and education.

213,86664,No,Image-based Multi-scale Physiological Planning for Ablation Cancer Treatment,"IMPPACT will develop an intervention planning and monitoring application for Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of malignant liver tumours. RFA is a minimally invasive form to treat cancer without open surgery, by placing a needle inside the malignancy and destroying it through intensive heating. Though the advantages of this approach are obvious, the intervention is currently hard to plan, almost impossible to monitor or assess, and therefore is not the first choice for treatment. IMPPACT will develop a physiological model of the liver and simulate the intervention's result, accounting for patient specific physiological factors. Gaps in the understanding of particular aspects of the RFA treatment will be closed by multi-scale studies on cells and animals. New findings will be evaluated microscopically and transformed into macroscopic equations. The long-established bio-heat equation will be extended to incorporate multiple scales. Validation will be performed at multiple levels. Images from ongoing patient treatment will be used to cross check validity for human physiology. Final validation will be performed at macroscopic level through visual comparison of simulation and treatment results gathered in animal studies and during patient treatment. This extensive validation together with a user-centred software design approach will guarantee suitability of the solution for clinical practice.

436,193272,No,Fast Assay for Pathogen Identification and Characterisation,"The emergence of highly diverse resistance mechanisms among pathogens requires their detailed analysis to guarantee an efficient medical treatment. The gold standard in clinical diagnostics is based on the cultivation of bacteria and their phenotypical characterisation. However, these methods are labour-intensive and time-consuming lasting in some cases up to a few weeks. Thus, faster diagnostic techniques are necessary to ensure an immediate and targeted treatment of the patient. DNA-based diagnostics can provide the relevant results within a few hours. The requirements for a clinical DNA-based characterisation method are high; more than 1000 clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, a few hundred phylogenetic marker genes and virulence factors have to be targeted (including SNP detection). The limit of detection has to be low because a few 100 bacterial cells in the blood system can lead to the death of the patient. It should be possible to analyse a wide range of clinical sample origins such as stool, blood, urine and saliva using the same test. In addition, the results have to be obtained within a single working day.  In our project, we will develop two diagnostic systems that can be with direct sample material from patients. Thus, the time-consuming cultivation of pathogens will be avoided. Additionally, the test will be more sensitive, specific and faster than any other test on the market using an innovative DNA probe concept.",0,0
269,89493,No,Event Recognition for Intelligent Resource Management,"PRONTO emphasizes the role of event recognition in intelligent resource management (IRM) and proposes a methodology for fusing data from various sources, analysing it to extract useful information in the form of events and delivering the resulting knowledge for decision making, through a user-friendly IRM application. In order to achieve this objective, PRONTO draws methods and expertise from the fields of data fusion, information extraction, temporal representation and reasoning, machine learning, and knowledge management systems. PRONTO derives its motivation from the fact that today's organizations collect data in various structured and unstructured formats, but are not able to fully utilize these data to support and improve their resource management process. Therefore, it is evident that the analysis and interpretation of the collected data needs to be automated and transformed into operational knowledge. Events are particularly important pieces of knowledge for resource management. PRONTO proposes the aforementioned synergy of techniques to facilitate the recognition of events from the collected raw data, that remain underutilized with current technologies. The PRONTO methodology to IRM comprises five main steps: (a) Aggregation of data from various sensors and communication between actors, e.g. fire-brigade officers. (b) Analysis of the data and extraction of 'low-level' events. (c) Recognition of 'high-level' events, using Dynamic fine-tuning of event models, using machine learning. The novelty of PRONTO lies in the difficult task of real-time, accurate recognition of complex events given multiple sources of information, including various types of sensor and modes of actor interaction. The usability and acceptance of the derived methods and tools in real-world environments will signal the success of the project. Progress will be measured by real end-users, participating actively, as consortium partners, in all stages of the development of the project.",0,0
40,32026,Yes,MULTIMEDIA OPTIMISATION AND DEMONSTRATION FOR EDUCATION IN MICROELECTRONICS,"MODEM is to exploit new technologies in simulation-assisted learning, co-authoring and flexible delivery to help higher education deliver the high-tech graduate skills now critical to the competitivity of the EU micro-electronics industry. Its specific plans include the training of lecturers in multimedia courseware development, and the verification of integrated MODEM facilities and evaluation of multimedia tools for teaching students in science and engineering. This target group will be broadened in a follow-up project to include high-tech companies and prepare for the eventual launch of a self-sustaining micro-electronics educational service.  The pervasivness of microelectronics and advanced silicon semiconductor technology is increasingly recognised across a wide range of industries. In sectors such as food, electronics, computers etc., the ability to exploit advances in microelectronics will be the key to many future market opportunities. The semiconductor industry will therefore play a critical role in shaping the future of European industry. In addition to the impact on other industries, the microelectronics industry in its own right has significant potential. Today, semiconductors are a $63 billion world market and are critical to the $751 billion world market for electronic systems [American Electronics Association]. By the year 2000, world semiconductor sales are expected to rise to $200 billion and the world electronics industry to $2 trillion [Dataquest incorporated, Semiconductor industry Service]. As a result of the rapid expansion in the semiconductor market, European industrial investment in new integrated circuit fabrication factories during the past three years was 2.3 billion ECU. However, to remain competitive, Europe must ensure access to an educated workforce in key enabling technologies such as materials design, device physics, ULSI processing and circuit design.   The MODEM project is focused on exploiting new and emerging technologies in the areas of simulation assisted learning, co-authoring and flexible delivery to enhance the contribution of the higher educational sector to addressing the skills shortage in the microelectronics industry. The project's strategic approach is based on exploiting new technologies in the areas of simulation assisted learning using commercial microelectronics modelling codes, co-authoring/pick and mix utilising a custom Lotus Notes software and flexible delivery utilising Euro ISDN as a multipoint distributer and the Internet for courseware delivery and course support. Key specific project objectives include:   - Training of tertiary level lecturers in multi-media courseware development using standard software tools such as Director/Lingo.  - Development of courseware pick and mix facility based on LOTUS NOTES  - Development of a computer simulation learner environment around a microelectronics modelling software package 'Virtual Wafer Fab'  - Verification of 'remote' simulation assisted learning using above environment through incorporation in standard courses at partner sites.  - Verification of co-authoring through co-authoring of new modules on VLSI design and advanced materials characterisation at partner sites.  - Verification of integrated MODEM facilities for tele-teaching of engineering and science students.  - Evaluation of multimedia based tools for teaching of engineering and science undergraduate and postgraduate students.  The target user groups are engineering and science undergraduate and postgraduate students in tertiary-level institutions. This will be broadened to both high technology SME's and major electronics companies in a follow on service orientated project. Indeed, the ultimate objective of the project is to prepare for the launch of a self sustaining microelectronics educational service. MODEM is supported by major microelectronics companies in Europe such as SGS-THOMSON and PHILIPS who will participate in both the project definition and evaluation phases of the project.  The MODEM consortium involves partners from five EC member states (Ireland, France, Denmark, UK and The Netherlands). The validation phase of the project involves an EU wide network of 20 universities that provide tertiary education in advanced materials and microelectronics. The project is of strategic importance to the competitiveness of the European microelectronics industry as this industry is critically dependant on an educated workforce. The project therefore contributes towards a key EU policy, namely; 'promotion of the competitiveness of European industry' by directly responding to the current shortage of skilled personnel in the microelectronics industry through the improvement of the higher education capability in this sector.",0,1
730,89246,No,e-Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Collaborative Research in Data Mining and Data-Intensive Sciences,"The goal of the e-LICO project is to build a virtual laboratory for interdisciplinary collaborative research in data mining and data-intensive sciences. The proposed e-lab will comprise three layers: the e-science and data mining layers will form a generic research environment that can be adapted to different scientific domains by customizing the application layer. The e-science layer, built on an open-source e-science infrastructure developed by one of the partners, will support content creation through collaboration at multiple scales and degrees of commitment---ranging from small, contract-bound teams to voluntary, constraint-free participation in dynamic virtual communities. The data mining layer will be the distinctive core of e-LICO; it will provide comprehensive multimedia (structured records, text, images, signals) data mining tools. Standard tools will be augmented with preprocessing or learning algorithms developed specifically to meet challenges of data-intensive, knowledge rich sciences, such as ultra-high dimensionality or undersampled data. Methodologically sound use of these tools will be ensured by a knowledge-driven data mining assistant, which will rely on a data mining ontology and knowledge base to plan the mining process and propose ranked workflows for a given application problem. Extensive e-lab monitoring facilities will automate the accumulation of experimental meta-data to support replication and comparison of data mining experiments. These meta-data will be used by a meta-miner, which will combine probabilistic reasoning with kernel-based learning from complex structures to incrementally improve the assistant's workflow recommendations. e-LICO will be showcased in a systems biology task: biomarker discovery and molecular pathway modelling for diseases affecting the kidney and urinary pathways.",0,0
461,47655,No,Animated real time radiation oncology worktools,"Objectives:  The general objective is to assess the viability of new real time treatment control and animated treatment planning tools in the care of cancer patients. The specific objectives are:  a) Real time, dynamic, in-treatment monitoring facilitating control based upon deviations from a desired irradiation geometry and/or dose plan.  b) To introduce knowledge on potential patient movement patterns into treatment planning.  c) The substitution of patient specific motion-sensor measurements into repeated application of (b) as a treatment progresses to conclusion.  d) The enhancement of clinical understanding through biological modeling as an oncological advisory facility in both (b) and (c).  The ARROW project seeks to bring about a significant advancement in the process of radiotherapy for cancer treatment. It addresses the problem that at present radiotherapy takes place in the context of a static patient. By this we mean that the patient is assumed to be stationary throughout the treatment delivery and to remain unchanged between radiation fractions delivered over a period of weeks. Obviously, this expectation is unrealistic. ARROW seeks to restore reality to radiotherapy by providing a series of physical and software tools that will enable clinicians to consider patient movement when planning, delivering and assessing their treatment of patients.  The project recognises that for movement to be fully integrated with contempory radiotherapy practise a number of new features need to be in place; - planning systems that allow animation and movement data; - exterior position and movement data gathered form the patient during treatment with high temporal resolution; - identification and tracking of critical internal body features in real time during treatment. Tools for the computer representation and manipulation of internal/external anatomical structures of importance (healthy or diseased) which lie within the radiation volume; - an understanding of the radio-biological issues raised by data and systems such as those above. The two major workpackages within ARROW address these specific needs.  Workpackage 1 concentrates upon the intreatment phase and develops tools for the automatic extraction of internal organ movement form MVI. Workpackage 2 deals with the treatment planning and assessment phases and provides the basis for the investigation into the radio-biological issues. This workpackage also delivers the components for external body sensing and anatomical structure modelling. The whole of ARROW is a close collaboration between clinicians, medical physicists, information scientists and engineers with the clear aim of bringing about a result, which is of CLINICAL value in the PRACTISE of radiotherapy. To this end ARROW is entirely clinically lead. The coordinating partner is a UK hospital and the chief scientist is a consultant at a German radiotherapy clinic. ARROW will disseminate its activities by means of a user group, which will be setup to monitor and provide further clinical input into the project.

926,225022,No,Impact Actions for social innovation agencies,"ImpAct Agencies intends to reshape and make more efficient, through the Twinning Advanced methodology, a set of services to support BICs and incubators. Through an open social innovation model, the project will allow BICs and incubators to support social impact SMEs and entrepreneurs to achieve a better impact and play an active role within the local social innovation ecosystem. By matching and integrating social entrepreneurship support programmes, policy strategies and online tools, ImpAct Agencies aims to design a modular kit of tools and services for accompanying entrepreneurs in improving their social impact. The consortium is composed by  four Innovation Agencies: ART-ER (Italy) - the project coordinator, Fundecyt-Pctex (Spain), WestBIC (Ireland) and IFKA (Hungary). All of them already work on the topic of social innovation and social entrepreneurship in different ways: shaping policy instruments, developing specific networks and projects or supporting and implementing policy strategies at local level. This twinning advanced action has a multiple goal, since it will support partners in: - carry on a peer review and assessment on their respective service through an active stakeholder engagement activity;  - reshape and combine those services linked to open social innovation model; - design a new service package for BICs and incubators dealing with social innovation ecosystems; - set up permanent relations within the partnership with the aim of improving each partners’ services and  - build an interregional community of social innovation agencies. The final output of the project is the drafting of a complete Design Option Paper, dedicated to analyse and describe all different scenarios in terms of background, framework conditions and organizations, process and service delivery system and stage of development.

343,106760,No,Social Innovation - Empowering the Young (SocIEtY) for the Common Good,"“Social Innovation–Empowering the Young (SocIEtY) for the Common Good” will both focus on and integrate disadvantaged young people into the research process to improve their quality of life and to foster social innovation. Therefore SocIEtY will extend the given informational basis for designing and implementing policies to reduce inequalities by giving voice and opportunities for developing aspirations to young people facing multifaceted inequalities while living in deprived city districts. The approach is to bring to the fore young persons’ concerns and voices about their self-perception and social participation in society. To accomplish these ambitious research tasks, the research strategy will benefit from the complementarities between qualitative and quantitative methodologies, reflected in the close interconnections between the Work Packages (WPs). SocIEtY will refine a coherent theoretical and methodological framework for the whole project on the basis of the Capability Approach. As a second step a documentary analysis and interviews with relevant political stakeholders and a longitudinal analysis of EU-SILC data will be carried out. Additionally, national and regional data for each partner country (WP3) for evaluating existing policies towards inequalities will be analysed. 11 analyses of social support networks (WP4) will be carried out, scrutinizing the strategies and policies of local actors in deprived city districts of each partner country. Finally, SocIEtY will develop an innovative participative research methodology (WP5) bringing different stakeholders and different narratives together. An aim of this empirical instrument is to enable deliberative processes in which every participant has equal opportunity to voice their concerns and aspirations with regard to the common good. Traditional empirical research is combined with a participation methodology, broadening the informational basis for social innovation in public policies.",1,0
17,214849,Yes,Social and gender inequalities in care: childcare-related policies and parenting practices in the post-Yugoslav countries and the role of policy ideas,"Studies indicate that the middle class disproportionally benefits from social investments in childcare which target both early childhood education and care and labour market participation of parents. Still, there is lack of comparative studies which would deepen theoretical and policy understanding of social investment approaches applied in various countries and their effect on childcare-related policies and via that outcomes. This project explores these issues by undertaking the first comparative study of childcare policies in the post-Yugoslav countries (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia). It explores the framing and development of entitlements to childcare-related leaves and services, the drivers of the reforms and their outcomes. It is particularly interested in (1) reform potential of the European social investment agenda to affect a redistributive dynamic in childcare and (2) parenting practices of those parents who appear to be redistributive losers of the European social investment agenda (e.g. parents with short-time contracts, unemployed). The data analysed will include national legislation and policy documents and information obtained through expert interviews and interviews with parents. The project tackles the innovative and important topic of social inequalities in childcare, seeking to enhance the understanding of the concept of care policy, and adds a new body of empirical evidence to the field of comparative family policy, and gender and social inequalities studies. By developing this study at the Department of Social Policy and Intervention at Oxford, the project will benefit from the Department`s multidisciplinary and international perspective and expertise. For the Department the project will add new knowledge and deepen its regional focus on Central and Eastern Europe, thus augmenting the Department`s knowledge and coverage of this part of Europe, and its focus on social inequality studies as they relate to childcare.",1,1
378,74610,No,Smart chips for smart surroundings,"The overall mission of the proposed 4S project (Smart Chips for Smart Surroundings) is to define and develop efficient (ultra low-power), flexible, reconfigurable core building blocks, including the supporting tools, for future Ambient Systems. The aim is to establish Europe as the dominant player in the field of efficient reconfigurable architectures for ambient devices.  Reconfigurability offers the flexibility and adaptability needed for future ambient devices, it provides the efficiency needed for these systems, it enables systems that can adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions, it enables communication over heterogeneous wireless networks, and it reduces risks: reconfigurable systems can adapt to standards that may vary from place to place or standards that have changed during and after product development. It is envisaged that in the long run, work performed within this project will lay the foundations for the development of a new range of ultra low-power components, architectures, tools, guidelines and standards that underpins the future development of Ambient Systems.  Main objectives for the 4S project are: - The design of a flexible reconfigurable platform based on heterogeneous building blocks such as analogue blocks, hardwired functions, fine and coarse grain reconfigurable tiles, DSPs and microprocessors that can adapt to several algorithms for Ambient Systems without the need for specialized ASICs. The concept is verified on hardware platforms. Furthermore, a digital SoC and an analogue front-end IC will be designed. The DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) and MPEG4 applications will be implemented on the platform in order to verify the flexibility of the platform. - To provide a design flow at compile time, which reduces development time and to provide functions that automatically allocate resources of the reconfigurable platform based on Quality of Service, power and user demands.

879,58386,No,Artefact Structural Learning through Imitation,"Recent research suggests that imitation, as evident in the individual development of human cognition and motor skills, is a paradigm that can endow artefacts with the ability for skill growth and life-long adaptation without programming. To demonstrate the power of this paradigm, we propose to develop a fully functional artefact with complex cognition and behaviour: a living artificial hand that learns structurally new complex action sequences by imitation.  This will be achieved by joining brain research cognitive psychology, neuroinformatics and robotics, to: i) explore the neuropsychological, neurophysiological, functional mechanisms of imitation learning in man and monkey; ii) design a bio-plausible computer model of imitational learning; iii) realise he full visuo-motor system. Results are a paradigm of imitation in man, a generic computer model and robot implementation, applicable to arte-facts that learn from and cooperate with humans, service robots and novel prosthetic aides.  OBJECTIVES Living artefacts will critically depend on mechanisms of action and task-level learning: for understanding and achieving missions, for cooperation with humans, for adapting to the environment. Imitation holds the potential to become a much more powerful means for learning complex cognition-action sequences than classical approaches because it much reduces the state-action space to be searched for motion generation.  We aim at: - exploring the functional and neuropsychological mechanisms of imitation learning; - revealing the neurophysiological structures for finger and hand movements in man and monkey; - designing a formal dynamic model of imitation learning; - constructing the fully functional artefact (visuo-motorsystem); - implement imitational learning on the artefact; - disseminate results back into neuroscience and infotech; - suggest applications of the new methods and models to artefacts with many degrees of freedom that cooperate with humans as well as new generations of prostheses.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The demanding goals can only be achieved by joining researchers from cognitive psychology, neurophysiology, cognitive neurology, neuroinformatics and robotics. Accordingly, the workpackages fall into several categories: basic research, modelling, prototype development and technical implementation, dissemination, coordination.  Concerning the functional/behavioural aspects of object grasping we shall: (1) test critical features of imitative object grasping in healthy persons and in patients with ideomotor praxia and cerebellar deficits; (2) construct a dynamic and a functional model of imitation.  For exploring the neurophysiological structures for object grasping and imitation in monkey we shall: (1) describe the functional and motor proper-ties of prefrontal neurons (PF) in response to object grasping movements; (2) develop a neurophysiological model of the basic visuo-motor organization of the pre-motor cortex (F5) and PF.  For revealing the neurophysiological mechanisms of grasping and imitation in man, we shall: (1) carry out MEG recordings in healthy subjects during observation and imitation of action; (2) describe the time course and topography of MEG responses of these experiments using dipole reconstruction techniques.  To develop a computer model for structural learning of multi-fingered grasping we shall: (1) define an integrating model architecture a close mutual coupling between the perceptual and motor level; (2) implement local learning rules that ensure the correct mapping between the available sensory information, movement primitives and behavioural sequences.  To implement the artefact on the basis of a robot system with advanced sensor and motor skills we shall: (1) build a perceptual system with emphasis on robustness and design atomic behaviours for the multi-fingered hand according to the neurophysiological findings; (2) integrate the dynamic model and the learning algorithms into a fully operational artefact.",0,0
1004,36104,No,Improvements of tagging methods for stock assessment and research in fisheries,"The objective of this CA project is improvement of the methodology of fish tagging techniques with emphasis on the application to fisheries research and stock assessment.  The justification for starting a CA proposal with these objectives is that although tagging experiments are among the oldest methods in fisheries research, some scientists disagree on the usefulness of conventional tagging experiments. In the opinion of some scientist these methods have many drawbacks because they are based on assumptions difficult to verify and there are various sources of uncertainty, which make the interpretation of the results difficult. Others have the opinion that by standardizing methods and doing research on the uncertainties and assumptions involved in tagging experiments, these methods can be improved and will become more useful in research and in stock assessment along with other assessment methods. To work towards this goal we have set up intermediate objectives.  The first one is a survey where information, such as the past, present and future use of tags and the opinion of researcher of reliability of tagging methods, is gathered from several important fisheries research institutes in Europe. Analysis of the results of this survey will be the tasks for workgroups which will discuss and then report on various ways to achieve improvements of the methodology and techniques of tagging.  The second most important activity of the CA is to facilitate information flow between laboratories and researchers by implementations of decentralized databank system on the World Wide Web. The knowledge of what has already been done and acquired during the CA project and the communication links developed will form the basis for recommendations on further research and standardization of methodology in this area.",0,0
301,82438,No,"Promoting and structuring a Multidisciplinary Academic-Industrial Network through the heteropolytype growth, characterisation and applications of 3C-SiC on hexagonal substrates","The aim of MANSiC project is to promote and structure a multidisciplinary training network for young researchers based on the challenging and promising development of 3C-SiC technology. Indeed, this cubic polytype of SiC was for long set apart due to the lack of adequate substrate so that the heteroepitaxial layers were far from device quality. Despite the recent availability of commercial 3C-SiC crystals, originally grown on Si, the defect density is still too high so that the blocking performances are far below the industrial needs. Using hexagonal SiC substrate, the cubic layers usually contain device killer defects. Recently, new growth techniques are being developed in Europe with very promising results since these defects can be completely eliminated. The re is no real competitor on the international level using similar techniques which means that Europe is in advance on this specific subject and has a major role to play. A joint effort on the growth of 3C-SiC on hexagonal substrate in the framework of MANS iC project would surely allow developing an alternative and European commercial source of this polytype with better crystalline quality than the actual commercial product. Such improved material would be first characterized and tested (from surface polishing to device fabrication) by the proposed MANSiC consortium with the aim of fabricating power devices such as VDMOSFET or MESFET. Such a complex and interrelated research project is an excellent base to assemble a training project for young researchers in the field of solid state physics and materials science. PhD students and young researchers will be trained in the various fields: from new growth techniques, to wide band-gap material characterization and fabrication of power devices. Workshops and summer schools will be organized to provide the young researchers with the essential scientific knowledge background and to give them the opportunity to present their work and results to the scientific community.",0,0

The objective of the Course is to provide European young researchers from laboratories, large- scale facilities or industry, with practical training at the doctoral and post-doctoral level in the field of Cryogenics. This will be achieved by lectures and practical courses given by teachers belonging to prestigious European research centres and leading cryogenics enterprises. Training several hundreds of young researchers in advanced cryogenics requires adequate facilities and skilled technical staff only available in a few large low temperature laboratories in the world. In Europe, Grenoble and Helsinki are internationally leading institutions is this field, with a long tradition in training in Cryogenics.  Two training courses are foreseen (Grenoble and Helsinki), as well as two conferences, organised in two other European countries. This course will contribute to develop the competitiveness of European research and industry by providing valuable training, disseminating scientific and technological knowledge, favouring the links between academic and industrial research, and creating strong professional links between event participants from different countries. This activity will also enable researchers of countries where knowledge in cryogenics is not developed to bridge a technological gap.

These are multi-stakeholder initiatives supported by a carefully designed and professionally facilitated creative process and pervasive technologies to help a district or a city create an innovative & sustainable public space and build a socially coherent & engaged community. We combine innovation process management, design thinking, innovation technologies and collaborative methods expertise to deliver state-of-the art support for such innovation labs.

The industrial relevance of the expected results are:  - Progress towards the integration of SLDSs best practice into software engineering. - Improved feasibility assurance of development projects (risk minimisation) and more exact feasibility assessment. - Improved procedures, methods, concepts and software tools. - Reduced development costs, accelerated development, improved maintenance and reusability. - Improved product quality and increased flexibility and adaptability. - Progress towards the establishment of dialogue engineering standards. - Improved guarantees to end-users that a product has been developed following best software and cognitive engineering practice. Enabling end-users to objectively assess different systems and components technologies against one another and choose the right product according to quality, price and purpose.  To achieve its objectives, DISC will (i) investigate a broad selection of state-of-the-art SLDSs to identify current practice and pinpoint its deficiencies; (ii) develop, test and disseminate a first reference methodology of best practice procedures and methods, and a toolbox of associated concepts and software tools. Dissemination will be done through workshops, courses for industry, an Industrial Advisory Panel and liaison with industry and relevant ongoing projects. Industrial collaboration and dissemination will be mediated through Elsnet (the European Language and Speech Network).  Software engineering best practice forms a backbone for the training of students in computer science and engineering who will later contribute to the development of computer systems in industry and research. By contrast, no current scheme specialises software engineering best practice to the particular purposes of dialogue engineering, that is, to the development and evaluation of spoken language dialogue systems (SLDSs). DISC aims to develop a first detailed and integrated set of development and evaluation methods and procedures (guidelines, checklists, heuristics) for dialogue engineering best practice as well as a range of support concepts and software tools. The goals of dialogue engineering include optimisation of the user-friendliness (or cognitive engineering) of SLDSs which will ultimately determine their rank among emerging input/output technologies.  DISC will contribute towards establishing dialogue engineering as a sub-discipline of software engineering, able to draw upon the rich variety of existing software engineering tools, methods and resources. As no similar research agenda has yet emerged in the US and Japan, DISC will contribute to placing European SLDSs research and industrial R&D in the international lead. Work will be carried out as an 18 months Concerted Action which draws together some of the main actors in the national and European advanced SLDSs development projects that have been executed during the last decade.  The development and commercialisation of integrated SLDSs is a recent fact. Only within the last few years have SLDSs matured to the point of attracting broad industrial interest. Simple, speaker-independent, telephone-based SLDSs using continuous and spontaneous speech have now become commercially available. More advanced SLDSs are entering the marketplace, as are platforms that support the implementation of novel applications. However, despite unquestionable progress, SLDSs development and evaluation is replete with unknowns and steps that are undersupported in terms of procedures, concepts, theory, methods and software tools. This situation continues to generate uncertainty about the potential of SLDSs technologies, their proper domains of application, their usability, the cost of producing them, their development time and the quality of products in both absolute and comparative terms. A European effort to remedy the situation seems timely and worthwhile given the proven potential of the technology and the fact that European industry is now very actively building up strength in the field.",0,0
872,44580,No,Development and further improvement of a novel resorbable bone cement for clinical applications,"Research objectives and content  The main objective is to improve the in vitro setting and hardening properties of a new biocompatible amorphous calcium phosphate bone cement with fast bone transformation rate and planning with time the in vivo experiments which are in fact very time consuming. Also, the analysis of the data takes time. In fact, these new biocompatible materials have to be characterised through the contract ERBFMB1CT961621. However, some natural delays have been produced in the development of this work due to the training and know-how transference between the IRC and myself. Also, delays have been produced in the development of some especial measurement equipments of fundamental importance to carried out up to the end the whole research project.  It is known that amorphous materials dissolve faster under in vivo conditions and in growth of new bone may also take place faster. Our experience in the development and characterisation of a-Tricalcium Phosphate (a-TC based calcium phosphate bone cements, gained during my PhD Thesis, allows to foresee a good potential for these ideas. At present, the physiochemical mechanisms controlling the setting and hardening properties of these cements are well understood. Moreover, the stability and in vivo behaviour of these cements are correlated with these mechanisms. The resulting ideas suggest that it is possible to control the in vivo behaviour of this kind of cements by the modification of some control factors affecting the powder phase, the liquid phase or the mixture. These seems to be a good possibility to modify the rate of resorption of these cements as well as the rate of new bone formation by adding some additives to the original a-TCP powder. From a previous study we know that one of these additives produces amorphous calcium phosphate cements. it will be important to study the resorption rates of the new formulations in vitro and in vivo as well as the osteoclastic and osteoblastic answers of the bone tissue around the implant.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  It should be pointed out that the possibility to use a wide range of very sophisticated techniques all of them available in the same centre will be of enormous interest. The possibility to perform cell culture tests as a biological feed-back for the physical and chemical development of the cement has a paramount relevance. It will be possible to optimise the product from all the important points of vue at the same time. The benefits will not only be personal, but the whole research group in Barcelona will profit of such training at my return. A great impact of to project is expected since the development of amorphous fast resorbable bone cements with a great capacity stimulating bone apposition is a goal that may be of enormous interest in traumatology, odontology and orthopaedics.

To continue in this succesful effort we have prepared the new concept for ERN 2014-15 with the following lead ideas: Science is Adventure and Experience the Science. The target is to challenge people to face the Science and to discover its beauty with aim to attracting the young generation to study science. The festival will present the most interesting research findings in Slovakia by leading Slovak universities, research institutes of the Slovak Academy of Sciences as well as representatives of innovative companies supporting R&D activities. The science shows will be held in shopping malls, but there will be also a number of side events in museums and observatories as well as discussions, lectures and various competitions.  A wide range of activities will cover all country´s territory (Bratislava, Banska Bystrica, Zilina, Kosice, Tatranska Lomnica). All festival venues in the five cities will offer opportunities to spend the day and night visiting the interesting presentations and lectures, test scientific applications, get in touch with the latest research outcomes and to speak with researchers. Thanks to the direct discussions with them people can discover their 'human face'. Since efforts during the event and also during awareness campaign will focus mostly on examples showing how interesting and important the career of researcher is, we believe the ERN 2014-15 will help us to tackle the still existing stereotypes about researchers and science and encouraging young people to embark on scientific careers. To support the ERN impact, event venues will be linked through  live streaming and as a member of Eusea we will use also this platform to provide the virtual and real connections between cities, venues and countries for exchange and collaboration.

611,59575,No,Euro Summer School on Risk Assessment for Reproduction,"Background: Adverse outcomes of reproduction can occur because of errors in the genetic constitution of embryo, adverse environmental exposures, or combination of both. Many scientific disciplines contribute to an understanding of human reproduction, as embryology, developmental biology and physiology, teratology, genetics, paediatrics and epidemiology. Not only does the multidisciplinary approach appear to be indispensable to investigate possible causes of adverse reproductive outcomes, but also in the implementation of research to improve public health. Objectives: The general aim of the course is to integrate biological and epidemiological. Knowledge to ameliorate the study approach on human reproduction, in order to improve scientific skills of the younger generation in the field of birth defects management.  The specific objectives of the course are to give participants a scientific advancement in: design and methods of epidemiological studies; detection of gene-environment interaction involved in human reproduction; methods for, surveillance; clustering and cluster detection; risk assessment and risk communication; methods for investigation and analysis in the birth defects field. Ethical issues will also be treated. Organisation: The School is organised as a six-day residential course. The programme is divided into two parts: concepts and methods on genetics, reproductive epidemiology and risk assessment for human reproduction; epidemiology of birth defects, focusing on methodologies and tools for investigation and analysis. Venue: Residential Conference Centre located in S.Miniato (Pisa), a medieval village easily reachable from Pisa or Florence by train or bus (about 40 minutes). Both Pisa and Florence have International Airports. The Residential Conference Centre is provided with adequate infrastructure and equipped with scientific facilities and technical supports (2 conference halls, 3 meeting rooms, 1 computer laboratory, private areas for free discussion). ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-2000-00284-1.pdf",0,0
416,60275,No,"Ageing, health and retirement in europe (AGIR)","Recent biometric research, based mainly on US data suggests that people not only live longer, but also in better health. This project will first document to what extent this trend exists in Europe as well. A comparison of data from existing national socio-economic panels will establish what happened over the last 10-15 years. A search of archives of health insurance companies and national health services should yield data spanning 40-50 years, thus allowing us to make more solid longer term projections for the health of the elderly. These projections will be used to asses the sustainability of social security system based on a detailed analysis of the influence of better health on the demand for health care and retirement decisions. Future elderly may demand less health care than anticipated because they are healthier, and they might also be able and willing to work longer, thus reducing the burden on pension systems.",0,0
18,220872,Yes,Socioeconomic gaps in language development and school achievement: Mechanisms of inequality and opportunity,"As inequality increases in most developed countries, children from socioeconomically disadvantaged families are at exceptional risk for academic underachievement with lasting consequences for individuals, their communities, and society at large. Among policy makes, early childhood education and care (ECEC) is considered a key to remedy this risk. Yet the science on ECEC effectiveness at a national scale lags behind the excitement.  Exploiting unique Norwegian data, we first seek to identify how and why socioeconomic disadvantage undermines children’s language skills and school achievement. Second, we will investigate whether ECEC can improve opportunities for disadvantaged children to excel. Third, to clarify the policy relevance of these inquiries, we will estimate costs of socioeconomic achievement gaps and the economic benefits of ECEC at scale. We take an investigative approach that is unprecedented in scope—from population level trends down to nuanced assessments of individual children’s growth.  Throughout the 2000s, Norway’s child poverty rates increased from about 4% to 10%, while the coverage of public ECEC for toddlers increased from 30% to 80%. Across this unique window of time, we have access to rich survey data on language skills and home environment for 100,000 children, and genetically informative data, linked with administrative records on community- and family level socioeconomic risks and opportunities, and on national achievement test scores. These data allow us powerful analytic opportunities, combining state-of-the-art statistical, econometric, psychometric, and genetic epidemiological methods.   I am well positioned to lead this project, having qualified for a Professorship at the University of Oslo aged 36, and having considerable experience in (a) publishing in highly respected scientific journals, (b) working at the intersection of research and policy, (c) leading research projects, and (d) mentoring younger scholars.",1,1
