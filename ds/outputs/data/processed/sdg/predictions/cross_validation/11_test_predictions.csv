365,45275,No,DISTRIBUTION CONTROL SYSTEM AND INNOVATIVE GAS TURBINE FOR IGCC PLANTS,"The aim of the project is to demonstrate the following : - Demonstrate an energy efficient, low emission operation of an innovative gas turbine design with high availability within an IGCC process. -Implementation of advanced process control techniques to improve the dynamic behavior of the IGCC plant. The problem will be addressed with a process simulator. -Implementation of optimisation techniques to increase the efficiency and availability and to monitor emissions in the plant.  The project is to design, develop and demonstrate a state-of-the-art advanced performance gas turbine power plant operating in IGCC mode. The following describes the innovative parts of the project. Gas Turbine & Combustor : The GT13E2 gas turbine will be used as the basis of the IGCC GT unit. The GT13E2 has been developed with an advanced fully annular combustor and currently operates with ABB's low NOx EV combustor systems. For the combustion processes involved in the IGCC project, Medium Btu (MBtu) gas will be the source of fuel. The EV burner has already been modified and tested in the research phase of this project to safely and efficiently combust MBtu gas. The combustion is governed by the lean-premixed mode which inherently leads to superior emissions and reliability. The Distributed Control System will be based on ABB's ADVANT digital control system and will also make use of the SIMCON software system to build a full dynamic model of the IGCC plant. The gasifier, air separation unit, acid gas cleanup and combined cycle plant will be fully modeled in this work. All mathematical models for each major component will be derived and tested within the IGCC 'Simulator'. This is especially important for the operation in integrated mode where all major functional units are closely coupled to give good dynamic operation of the IGCC power plant.",0,0
80,204947,Yes,Social Art as a Tool for Empowerment: Housing Deprivation and Citizen Initiatives for Change,"Over the past decade, worsening affordability,homelessness, social and housing polarisation and new forms of housing deprivation have been an increasing concern for public policy in Europe. Symptom of this problem is a set of art projects focused on housing issues. These social art projects have also served to highlight and fill the gap left by inexistent social structures, which should ideally provide wellbeing for all. The art projects about housing paired with other initiatives coming from civil society (as non-governmental organizations with social and humanitarian foundation, social entrepreneurship, and volunteer based social initiatives) have a potential to engage citizens creatively and initiate positive social change by increasing wellbeing and community feeling.  Addressing this need, the overarching objective of this project is to deliver a new methodology that will address Social Art and Housing. This methodology will allow the Fellow to outline the best practice for how art can be used in housing planning, for enhancing the quality of life in decaying neighborhoods, in urban regenerations, and homelessness problems. To achieve this objective the project will bring together a talented researcher with a background in art and urban theory to work with an internationally recognized research group with expertise in actor network theory, social art and field research design in order to deliver a novel interdisciplinary methodology developed through empirical research and validated through case studies in the UK and Serbia. The following research objectives will deliver the key components of the new social art and housing methodology:  Objective 1: to map actors in the field of social art and housing networks  Objective 2: to develop models of best practices of social art and housing networks  Objective 3: to refine the models through comparison of best practices in Serbia and UK   The research will be divided in six stages organized in six work packages.",1,1
1055,51127,No,Evolution and growth in networks of technology-based small and medium- sized enterprises (SMES) and large firms,"RESEARCH OB JECTIVES physiological traits and diseases. In contrast to its central role in physiology, biochemistry, toxicology, transplantation research, cancer research, neurobiology and other fields, the rat has lagged behind the mouse as a genetic model organism. Molecular biology has catalysed the convergence of physiology and genetics, and consequently there is an increasing need for genetic studies in the rat. In the past few years there has been very significant progress in rat genome analysis. While almost no reliable gene assignment was available in the early 80'es, some 600 rat genes have now been assigned to specific chromosomes, and a genetic map with some 650 markers is also available. Teams participating in the present project have been intimately involved in this development, contributing about half of the chromosome assignments and also to the construction of the linkage maps. Furthermore, the participating teams have developed the only existing international rat genetic database (RATMAP). Thus European teams have a strong tradition in rat gene mapping, and our proposal is to generate mapping resources and information necessary to take advantage of the rat for the identification of genes underlying traits relevant to mammalian physiology, behaviour and complex disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, susceptibility to cancer or stress, drug addiction etc. The genetic basis of such traits could be understood if the rat genome was better known. The proposed project contains two parts: mapping the rat genome on the one hand and analysis of multifactorial traits on the other. The mapping work will include: - genetic linkage work of transcribed genes,especially 'anchored reference loci' for comparative mapping, and of anonymous markers, using molecular methods that have already been implemented in the participating labs, and with rat strains and strain crosses already available, generation of new markers (e.g. AFLP, RAPD) - chromosome and cytogenetic mapping of genes using cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), including orientation of the linkage groups with respect to the chromosomes and amalgamation of the genetic linkage and the cytogenetic maps - isolation of whole genome radiation hybrids to generate a high resolution map of active genes, even if they are devoid of genetic polymorphism - construction of new genomic DNA libraries - ensuring availability of the generated data as well as those linkage data disseminated in the literature to the scientific community via expansion of the already implemented rat genome database and the rat encyclopedia which is being implemented. The analysis of multifactorial traits will deal with cancer, neurological and psychiatric disorders, autoimmune diseases and the dissection of the rat MHC, metabolic studies, hypertension and morphogenesis. This work will be greatly facilitated by the collaborations established within the proposed project, and by the flow of new information among the groups.",0,0
889,91219,No,Modelling Market Interaction,"It is widely recognised that the standard notion of market equilibrium omits many aspects of how real markets function. Who sets prices, who trades with whom and how the market settles, if it does on a single price for each good are largely unanswered questions. To obtain an understanding of how markets actually function and their dynamics, we have to allow for the different degrees of rationality of market participants, learning mechanisms and the structure of the interactions between the various agents. The idea of this project is to base the analysis on observed empirical facts and the basic claim is that markets have to be analysed as complex adaptive systems, where each institution and set of rules influences individual behaviours in a specific way. Our modelling approach is a mix of different research methodologies: empirical, theoretical, experimental, and computational. The present project will concentrate on two market environments, i.e., perishable goods market and electricity markets. In the former, the goods are not storable and thus inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities do not occur, whereas the latter is a paradigmatic example of complex market where multi-settlement market mechanisms are a standard feature. This research will have a strong social impact as poorly functioning market mechanisms can lead to high prices and to price discrimination, which are current strong concerns in Europe as a result of the recent increase in inflation and the complicated contagious feedback from prices to expectations and consumer confidence. My training in computer science, engineering and economics gives me the necessary experimental and theoretical background to carry out this study. Very encouraging preliminary results have already been obtained in collaboration with the research group in Marseille and within the context of the STREP, “ComplexMarkets”. The project results should be of interest to a wide audience of researchers in economics and to policymakers.",0,0

689,1723,No,Specification of radiation quality at the namometer level,"Description of research work  Research concerning the best way of specifying radiation quality for radiobiology and radiation protection by physical parameters expressing the relationship between track structure and target structure remains a central task of microdosimetry. Since both molecular biological and radiobiological analysis (track segment method) suggest critical target sizes of a few nanometres for cellular radiation effects, the imperfection of present microdosimetric simulation of volumes in the micrometre range have become evident. For all ionizing particles or particle configurations (eg Auger cascade) which produce a high concentration of deposited energy on the nanometer scale but having ranges much smaller than the micrometre dimensions, the spatial resolution of present microdosimetric detectors is inadequate. The project has four main aims.   Track structure studies for nanometre targets  The aim is to establish the approximated constancy of the delta ray contribution to the energy deposition fluctuation in a nanometre target. To establish the constancy of the radiation of restricted LET to linear primary ionization.   Biological validation of the best suited parameter  The aim is to select bench mark sets of survival, chromosome aberration and molecular lesion data to test and confirm the ability of linear primary ionization and restricted LET to determine their variation with radiation quality.   Experimental studies of associate detector systems  The aim is to measure the ionization pattern around charged particles tracks and study a portable device able to simulate T.E. volumes of few tens of nanometres in size.   Quantification of indirect action from single tracks  The aim is to conduct an experimental study of the yield and spatial distribution of paramagnetic free radicals formed in the wake of individual tracks by measurement of relaxation time and using the ESR technique; and to compare the experimental results with the predictions of a simplified theoretical model of biological  effectiveness .  Research has been carried out in order to investigate the working characteristics of a cylindrical tissue equivalent plate chamber (TEPC) at very low pressures and to develop a gas counter able to measure the ionization pattern near the track of a charged particle at nanometre (nm) level.  The coordinated experiment aims to measure the ionization distributions as close as 20 nm, or less, to the track with enough spatial resolution to test the Monte-Carlo calculations which point out that the ionization distributions very close to the particle path are independent of the particle type and energy.  Gas detectors working in pulse mode can measure ionization distributions. The 2 experimental problems to solve are: to measure 1 single electron; to obtain the information on the initial position of the electron within a few nm uncertainty.  The diffusion of electrons in gas is related to the gas pressure (P) and the travelling path (X). By decreasing the gas pressure the detection precision of the single electron is improved even if the diffusion in the gas increases at low pressures, due to the fact that in this experiment the precision is related to simulated lengths.  In order to obtain a position uncertainty inside the nm range it is necessary to work at about 1 torr of pressure or less and with drift lengths of about 1 mm. The intention is to manufacture a track detector made up of 2 parts: the drift region and the multiplication region. The drift region is defined by 2 parallel plates a few mm apart; the charge particle crosses the drift region at selected lateral distances from 2 parallel to beam slits defining the ionization collecting region. The electrons produced in that region are made to drift into the multiplication region where they are detected.  The first track detector to be assembled will have a single wire cylindrical proportional counter as multiplication region. The multiplication characteristics of the cylindrical proportional counter eq uipped with a 10 um anode have been measured in the propane based TE mixture at different pressures down to 22.7 Pa (0.17 torr), using an experimental set up modified in order to use low velocity ions as a probe. The results show that a drift region exists even at very low pressures. This finding assures the possibility of separating properly the drif and the avalanche region even if the grid, which will separate the 2 regions, is not able to completely confine the electrical field.  Limitaions to the conventional dosimetry instrumentation, currently used for control exposure in radiological protection and in radiation therapy, are directly traceable to lack of knowlwdge of the required response function for ionizing radition. Consequently modifying factors which are dependent on the type of radiation must be applied to the instrumental response if bioeffectivenesss is to be assessed. Recent rediation research has produced a concensus tha double stand breaks induces in the DNA of mammalian cells constitute the dominantly important lesions which lead to chromosome aberrations, oncogenic transformation and genetic mutation. The object of the research was to explore methods of obtaining physical deviceshaving a response which will simulate the yield of double strand breaks in DNA. A completely new generation of dosimeters is anticipated. Ideally the devices should be in the condensed phase with radiation sensors of nanometre dimensions. Arrrays of detectors are envisaged foe application in radiological protection. Feasibility studies have been carried out and preliminary research is being conducted with various novel detectors based on MOSFET, Langmuir Blodgett films, thin film scintillators, miniature liquid filled proportional counters, etc.  A topologic study of the delta-ray escape from targets small in comparison with delta-ray ranges has brught a unique chance for microdosimetry to characterize radiation quality with a single radiophysical parameter when targets of nanometer dimensions are concerned. The biological establishment and physical generalization of this new and far-reaching observation are underway. Monte-Carlo histories of particle tracks projected upon cylindrical targets of various lengths and diameters in the nanometer range have been studied for electron and photon radiations as well as for protons and alpha particles, and the mean primary ionization density respectively the restricted linear energy transfer I Delta which is proportional to it for small small values of Delta was thereby further qualified as the single determinant of energy deposition fluctuation varying with the primary prticle. Restricted linear energy transfer (LET) is defined to exclude kinetic energies of delta-rays larger than Delta. The low cutoff energy Delta = 100 eV was chosen to secure this proportionality.  Proving this as a general regularity is underway, utilizing the fact that the invariability of the delta-ray fluctuation contribution for nanometer targets rests on the invariability of the low energy portion of the delta-ray spectrum, which is due to the physical regularities of glancing collisions.  The correlaton of various cellular effects with restricted LET is being investigated. A convincing linear dependence of yield coefficient alpha for dicentric chromosomes in human lymphocytes upon L100,D has been observed and is more and more confirmed by new experimental results. The Restricted LET dependence of other cellular and molecular radiation effects, which may lead to combined applications of L100,D and L100,T is under investigation.  The cross section data set for the Monte-Carlo simulation program has been extended to proton energies below 100 keV using analytical functions given by M E Rudd (Radiation Protection Dosimetry 31, 17-22, (1990)) for the ejection of secondary electrons from different shells in water vapour. By subtraction of the kinetic energy of the secondary electrons and the ionization potential energy from stopping power cross sections the excitation cross section was derived under the assumption of a mean excitation energy of 12.6 eV. The energy deposition by simulated proton tracks traversing spherical targets of 1 to 100 nm diameter was calculated for 10 to 100 keV. Below 10 nm straggling effects lead to asymmetric distributions.  The invariance of secondary electron track component with regard to proton energy for nanometer targets was analysed. The contribution of single secondary electron tracks to the dose meanlineal energy for nanometer targets over the proton energy range from 0.2 MeV up to 15 MeV was derived from the corresponding proximity function component. For 1 and 2 um targets only a small variation was seen. This indicates the postulated invariance.  An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer was adaped to measure precisely the spin spin relaxation time by means of the determination of microwave field in the cavity. Determination of the spin spin relaxation time by the method of saturation requires knowledge of the intensity of the field inside the cavity. The Slater method, originally developed for accelerators considers changes of the frequency of the cavity as a consequence of the introduction of a very small conducting sphere to the point where the sample is placed during ESR measurements. The metal sphere was mounted on a micropositioner and the measuring system was used to determine the necessary quantities. The intensity of the magnetic field was then found.  Local radical densities were determined in gamma ray irradiated samples of solid biochemicals as a function of imparted dose. The average concentrations of radicals in the bulk of the solid matrix are found from the total absorbed dose and the intensity of ESR line. The procedure is lengthy, involving comparison of the unknown sample with the known amount of diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and the absolute values of yield were found with an uncertainty of at least \/- 8%.  In condensed media the electrons, released as a consequence of interaction of photons with medium, lose energy in the ionization regions: spurs, blobs, short tracks and principal tracks. The local radical density in spurs and blobs is of interest. The blobs have dimensions of an order of nanometers. The local radical concentration inside an ionization region does not increase with dose as measurements have confirmed for amino acids. Radiation doses of gamma rays from cobalt-60 Co have been used in the region of linear response because of the appearance of dose saturation signifies an overlap of spurs. The typical concentrations of radicals in amino acids are between 5 E19 to 2 E20 radicals per cm{3}. For 2-component and 3-component polyaminoacids the concentrations are about 50% smaller. Local radical densities were measured in some carbohydrates as well as in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and some nucleosides. In order to arrive at the local spacing between radicals the volume of the trapping region within the spur must be known. This, can be estimated from the knowledge of energy deposited in a spur.  To assist in the measurements utilizing the Katsumura method of determining the degree of signal saturation, 2 computer programs were written, one calibrates the readout, eliminates the skew and smoothes the lineshape and the second obtains the product of spin spin and spin lattice times. Track structure studies, based on computer simulation, recent cross section and adequate statistical concepts such as distribution parameters, pattern recognition and target modelling, will provide the physical basis for validation of the proposed quantities of linear primary ionization or restricted LET. The phenomenon of O-ray cutoff at nanometre target boundaries will need further study, and the proposed close correlation of these quantities with lineal energy in simulated nanometre volumes will have to be substantiated. The work will include recent cross sections and genomic target structure.   The ultimate decision concerning the suitability of the new radiation quality parameters must be provided by their ability to predict the dependence of radiobiological yields on radiation quality. This work, already started by the groups cooperating in promoting linear primary ionization or restricted LET, needs further effort in broadening the biological data base and stepping forward from retrospective analysis to a predictive approach.   The actual experimental studies, which aim to determine the lowest simulation limit of slow ions as probes to explore the avalanche characteristics of single wire and field grid TEPC. A tissue equivalent multistep parallel plate avalanche chamber will be manufactured to measure single ionizations in order to study the correlation between primary ionization and restricted LET. The possibility of manufacturing a small cylindrical avalanche chamber will be studied. In parallel with the gas filled detectors, a feasibility study will be carried out with the object of simulating the biological response to radiations in nanometre dimensions in condensed phase detectors. The optimum method will be selected, guided by the biological analysis, and work will begin on a device.   ESR measurements will be used to explore the spatial distribution, mean life times and reaction rates of free radicals generated by charged particle tracks in nucleic acids, proteins, amino acids from cell cultures and, possibly, whole tissues. Measurement of radical density is based upon the dependence of the saturation value of microwave magnetic fields upon the spin spin relaxation time. The possibility of adapting simplified theoretical methods, developed for enzyme inactivation by indirect action, will be explored in an attempt to obtain a more meaningful model of radiation action for radiation protection purposes.   Collaboration schedule  Although the collaborators will support each other mutually by the exchange of theoretical and experimental data, the collaboration main lines will be the following:  Gottingen-Neuherberg for the track studies;  St. Andrews-Gottingen for the biological validation;  Legnaro-St.Andrews-Neuherberg for the experimental studies;  Rome-St.Andrews for the interpretation of the indirect action studies.",0,0

It will provide a sound evidence base for green infrastructure planning and implementation, exploring the innovation potential, and linking environmental, social and economic services with local communities.  Working from the local to the city-regional level, the project aims to: 1) Develop urban green infrastructure as a planning concept for both integration and promotion of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and adapt it to local contexts; 2) apply an innovative biocultural diversity perspective to develop successful governance arrangements facilitating socio-ecological integration and local engagement in planning of urban green spaces; and 3) explore how valuation and real market integration of biodiversity and ecosystem services can facilitate choices in favour of the development of multifunctional green spaces in urban areas.  Approaches and tools under these three interlinked objectives will be developed and implemented through an integrative, iterative and transdisciplinary process. GREEN SURGE will embrace a three-tiered approach of comparative European cases, synthesis of good practices, and establishment of five Urban Learning Labs strategically selected to represent different urban situations in Europe.

Project results will be validated via pilots in three (3) different countries and contexts, thus granting the possibility to generalise results and ensuring replicability throughout Europe and beyond.The key success factor for effective energy efficiency initiatives at community level is to involve all the stakeholders who have active role in decision making and provide them the right information at the right time to take informed decisions; to this extent, user engagement through social networks can foster participation and energy consumption awareness. Stakeholders (i.e. citizens, household landlords, public spaces managers and urban planners) need tools and information to understand and assess alternatives to traditional consumptions patterns and inertial behaviours leading to high consumption levels. Energy providers need information and tools to implement business models oriented to energy service proposition oriented to a sustainable consumption model.There is need to go beyond acting on energy consumptions under direct control to understand ex-ante savings that can be achieved through energy efficiency related measures, management tools, and new services and implement them along with the related cost/benefit ratio. Although regulations about buildings, infrastructures and public spaces are fostering the implementation of important energy efficiency measures, a major driver for the change are the actual economic saving for users obtained from energy efficiency based business models.

729,91732,No,A coordinated approach twards development of a scientific basis for management of wild Atlantic salmon in the North-East Atlantic,"OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS The problems to be addressed Salmon display great plasticity in the age at which they migrate to sea, the age at which they mature, and the occurrence of repeat spawning. This may lead to significant overlap of generations. Additionally, because of their diadromous life cycle and varied oceanic migration behaviour, physical/temporal overlap occurs in oceanic and home-water fisheries, many of which exploit salmon from more than one river stock.  While biological information can be gathered on fish numbers in rivers with monitoring programmes, and in coastal and high seas fisheries, it is very difficult at present to relate this to production at the population level and to advise managers on how many fish can be safely caught nationally, regionally, or locally, while still fulfilling long-term management goals.",0,0

299,227192,No,Spatio-Temporal Methods for Data-driven Computer Animation and Simulation,"Numerical simulations are of tremendous importance for a wide range of scientific disciplines and commercial enterprises. For the majority of these natural phenomena, we not only need to consider the three spatial dimensions, but additionally we need to resolve how these phenomena develop over time. Thus, most natural simulations inherently need to resolve four dimensional functions, and most effects at human scales require fine discretizations along all four axes. As a consequence, these functions require large amounts of resources to compute and store. This problem becomes even more pronounced with the advent of data-driven techniques and machine learning. The learning algorithms effectively add additional dimensions, and the complexity and dimensionality of the corresponding functions explains the current lack of data-driven algorithms for space-time functions despite their enormous potential.  Within this research project I plan to address the fundamental difficulties that arise in this setting: I will develop novel algorithms to infer spatio-temporal functions, and to construct efficient representations to tame their complexity and high dimensionality.   This project combines numerical simulations with computer vision, and machine learning, and has the potential to radically change the way we work with physical simulations. Not only will it break new ground for fast and controllable VFX animations, but it will additionally facilitate the development of new ways to capture physical effects, in conjunction with algorithms to make physical predictions based on observations.

167,95704,No,Nuclear architecture in DNA repair and formation of chromosomal translocatons,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur frequently in the genome by DNA damaging agents or during genome replication. DSBs are hazardous because interaction between DNA ends from different double strand breaks can produce tumorigenic chromosome translocations. Little is known about how repair factors function in the context of chromatin and how translocations form in vivo. I developed a cell system in which a DSB can specifically be induced at a defined genomic site and follow the fate of damaged DNA in living cells. Using this system, I showed but that the broken ends are positionally stable and unable to roam the cell nucleus and I identified that the repair factor Ku80 is required for maintaining the alignment of broken ends. I extended the use of this system to probe how DSBs are recognized in vivo and how DDR pathways are triggered in the context of chromatin. I found that tethering a single component of a DSB repair complex to chromatin is sufficient to elicit the DDR in the absence of DNA damage and that stable association of the mediator of DDR MDC1 induces high local chromatin decondensation. I will use a combination of advanced live cell imaging and biochemistry techniques to further test the importance of nuclear architecture in maintaining genomic integrity and I will identify novel factors involved in DSB repair and alignment of broken chromosomes. More specifically I plan to: 1. Visualize the formation of chromosome translocations in vivo and determine the role of chromatin structure and nuclear organization in the process using time-lapse imaging. 2. Investigate the role of the repair factor MDC1 in chromatin decondensation using yeast two hybrid and advanced biochemistry in mammalian cells. 3.

We use the proposers' mediation system concept 'Virtual Destination Application' (VDA) , which is a combination of advanced WEB technologies and of a 'Virtual Enterprise' (VE) business approach to co-ordinate partners and customers.  Our hypothesis is that only the combination of leading technology with VE business concepts will boost the take-up of e-commerce in tourism. While the VE is a tested approach to large chains in tourism, its take-up is lagging for many SMEs. However, especially SMEs need a complementary business-to-business solution to implement the technology and the business model to deliver in the emerging electronic marketplaces.  The concept of VDA aims to introduce web-based leading edge technology providing an extensive range of services and a dissemination platform in order to establish a one- stop- shop for the tourist customer. Therefore VDA uses the technology of virtual reality modelling, which is at the moment in an early stage of the lifecycle. A first prototype in Berlin shows the potentials of this technology to be used for multimedia information dissemination, especially for web-presences of whole cities in combination with their enterprises.

This places accessibility at the core of the main challenges of EU’s urban areas. A proper identification of causes of low accessibility combined with a profound knowledge of the outcomes of a particular pattern facilitate the formulation of the most efficient policy response that leads towards social inclusion, an increase of well-being, and a fully-fledged citizenship of contemporary societies. The CAlCULUS project aims to deepen understanding of the causes and consequences of unfavourable accessibility patterns in order to develop a decision-support model which facilitates more efficient and just transport management. The growing potential of smart cities and the recent development of big data mining provide new opportunities for innovative analyses of accessibility and travel behaviour. The previous experience of the fellow in the field of accessibility and international comparative urban studies, together with the host’s expertise in the application of big data for transport research, create perfect conditions for the implementation of the proposed research project. The influential position of the UCM and the experience of its Scientific Culture and Dissemination Unit guarantee efficient communication of the project results to diverse target groups and facilitate public engagement. Mentoring from the supervisor, and the support of the host institution which includes dedicated training opportunities, teaching involvement, and the development of management skills, will be a milestone in a path towards research maturity and will lay the foundations for the future establishment of the fellow’s own research team.",1,1

1211,82024,No,The systematics of Sponges without mineral Skeleton and its Phylogeographic implications,"The proposed project is the unravelling of the evolutionary patterns of keratose sponges. Sponge systematics and phylogeny is still a weakly resolved field. The systematics of sponges without a mineralized skeleton (keratose sponges) in particular, is still unknown.  Many sponges are producers of bioactive molecules such as antibiotics and anti-fungal compounds, and find increasing application in anti-cancer research and pharmaceutical industry. Knowledge in sponge taxonomy and systematics are necessary as a basis for applied work on sponge culturing and the biochemical research into those secondary metabolites.  Furthermore, robust sponge phylogenies are necessary for research on biodiversity, which is the basis for conservation work. The project consists of t he reconstruction of a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the four keratose sponge orders at genus level, based on three independent genes.  The resulting phylogeny will provide further insight on demosponge higher systematics, keratose sponge relationships, morphological character evolution and the use of chemical compounds in systematics. Additionally, the species phylogeny of the subfamily Phylospongiinae will be resolved to get insight into sponge dispersal, phylogeography and biodiversity.  The applicant is experienced in molecular systematic techniques and analysis methods and is applying for a two-year outgoing period to the Queensland Museum in Brisbane, Australia to obtain the necessary training in sponge taxonomy and biodiversity. It has a broad sponge collection from the Indo-West Pacific, which is a hotspot for keratose sponges.  The staff will provide the applicant with excellent facilities and training on taxonomy and biodiversity as expertise for a successful establishment of applied sponge sciences in Europe. The incoming phase will take place in the Geoscience Centre Göttingen where the applicant will obtain knowledge on phylogeographic aspects of sponge biodiversity and evolution.",0,0
372,87622,No,Rigorous Mathematical Connections between the Theory of Computations and Statistical Physics,"The proposed research aims to enhance the study of randomness in computation by using ideas of statistical physics. In particular, it aims to place the connection between computation and statistical physics --- the subject of wide heuristic discussion for more than three decades --- on rigorous mathematical ground. Its main methodological vehicle is the study of random Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs are the common abstraction of numerous real-life problems and occur in areas ranging from aerospace design to biochemistry. Their ubiquity makes the design of efficient algorithms for CSPs extremely important. At the foundation of this endeavor lies the question of why certain CSP instances are exceptionally hard while other, seemingly similar, instances are easy. Probability distributions over instances allow us to study this phenomenon in a principled way, with each CSP distribution controlled by its ratio of constrains to variables (known as constraint density). By now, it has been established that random CSPs have solutions at densities much beyond the reach of any known efficient algorithm. Understanding the origin of this gap and designing algorithms that overcome it is the main focus of the proposed research. Ideas from statistical physics will play an important role here. Specifically, in recent years, physicists have proposed a heuristic but deep theory for the evolution of the solution-space geometry of random CSPs according to which algorithmic barriers correspond to phase transitions in this evolution. Examining the validity of the physics theory is a major research undertaking that must develop and reconcile notions shared by computation and statistical physics, e.g., the role of long-range correlations. A rigorous mathematical theory of such notions will enable a much more energetic exchange of ideas between the two fields, and has the potential to bring substantial fresh ideas to the study of efficient computation.",0,0
295,57804,No,Enhanced Techniques for CORBA Validation,"A project to enhance the techniques used to verify the conformance of implementations of OMG's CORBA technology. Research into new ways of specifying and testing new versions of CORBA specifications and implementations will be conducted to produce new tools and tests that can be validated by implementers.

1003,198459,No,Migration as Development,"How do processes of development and social transformation shape human migration? More specifically, how do  development process affect the geographical orientation, timing, composition and volume of both internal and international migration? The relation between development and human mobility is highly contested. While economic development in poor countries and areas is usually seen as the most effective way to reduce migration, other studies suggest that development actually increases migration. However, evidence has remained highly inconclusive so far because of theoretical and methodological limitations.    This research develops new theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a fundamental understanding of the relation between development processes and human migration. While prior analyses focused on a limited number of economic and demographic ‘predictor’ variables, this project applies a broader concept of development to examine how internal and international migration trends and patterns are shaped by wider social, economic, technological and political transformations.   This will be achieved through (i) theory-building (reconceptualising migration as an intrinsic part of broader development processes) enabling the formulation of appropriate hypotheses; (ii) quantitative tests drawing on new, innovative databases on international and internal migration flow and stocks; and (iii) mixed method case-studies of six countries (provisionally Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco and the Netherlands) representing different development-migration trajectories over the 19th and 20th centuries.    This project is scientifically ground-breaking by fundamentally shifting our understanding of how long-term development and social transformation processes shape human migration. This is also relevant for policy by challenging popular understandings of migration as a development failure and to make more realistic assessments of how future global change may affect migration.",0,0
86,110123,Yes,'New Italians': The Re-Making of the Nation in the Age of Migration,"As a result of international migration, national societies in Europe are becoming increasingly diverse from an ethno-cultural, religious, and racial perspective. Demographic projections show that this transformation is expected to increase in the future. The socio-economic and cultural impact of this demographic change has been extensively investigated especially in relation to migrants and their children. There is indeed a rich scholarship analyzing forms of adaptation, acculturation, and assimilation to the majority society. Similarly, scholars have investigated at length the negotiation of migrants’ every day lives in local places, as well as their transnational connections. Forms of multiple, hybrid, ‘creole’ identities have also been theorized, in association with calls for a post-colonial cosmopolitanism. Yet, within this scholarship, the nation as the discursive expression of a collective ‘we’ has been largely ignored. When the nation remains in place, it is often treated as a given and unproblematic ensemble of features, values, and principles against which migrants must show their degree of ‘integration’. No investigation is usually made into how this collective referent might change due to the demographic change of its populace. The proposed research aims to bring the nation back into migration studies, not as a substitute, but as a dimension complementing ‘local’, transnational, and cosmopolitan registers. By focusing on the case of Italy, the research will analyze the ‘re-making’ of the nation from three perspectives: political institutions and parties; migrants and children of migrants who claim their national belonging (‘New Italians’); the receiving society, as expressed through the voices of school teachers and their students. As the nation continues to inform social discourses and practices, to explore how it is re-signified in contexts of ethno-cultural pluralism remains essential to understand current processes of social inclusion/exclusion.",1,1

CHIC will reduce the ‘time to market’ for the technology and support ‘market lift off’ – 2 central objectives of the Joint Undertaking. CHIC will: - Intensively test the technology to generate learning for the final steps towards commercialisation by operating a minimum of 26 H2FC buses in medium sized fleets in normal city bus operation, and substantially enlarging hydrogen infrastructure in 5 European regions. - Embed the substantial knowledge and experience from previous H2FC bus projects (CUTE & HyFLEET:CUTE). - Accelerate development of clean public transport systems in new European Regions. - Conduct a life cycle based sustainability assessment of the use of H2FC buses in public transport, based on a triple bottom line approach considering environmental, economic and social aspects. - Identify the advantages, improvement potentials, complementarities and synergies of H2FC buses compared with conventional and alternative technologies - Build a critical mass of public support for the benefits of ‘green’ hydrogen powered transport, leading to increased visibility and political commitment across Europe.  The project is based on a staged introduction and build-up of H2FC bus fleets and the supporting infrastructure across Europe. A phased approach will link experienced cities and new cities in partnerships, greatly facilitating the smooth introduction of the new systems now and into the future. Using this arrangement the project will be linked to other projects fully funded from other sources and therefore magnifies the impact of the JTI.

466,103739,Yes,Urban Knowledge Network Asia,"Asia’s mounting global importance includes a remarkable growth is urbanisation. Over 60 percent of the estimated 3.5 billion Asian population are now living in cities. A city’s most important asset is indeed its inhabitants (ADB 2008, Managing Asian Cities). If we are to address such unparalleled growth of Asian megacities, effective urban management must be informed by qualitative analytical knowledge and framed within a global, pluri-disciplinary experience that a transcontinental mobility programme such as the International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES) can provide. The challenge is for urban scholars and practitioners – policy makers or community leaders – to create a balance between the benefits and costs of urbanisation with a view of improving the quality of life of millions. The objective is to nurture more contextualised and policy-relevant knowledge on Asian cities, through exchanges and targeted case-study-based research among participants from the 11 partner institutions, with the European institutions playing a key role.  Inspired by the new qualitative emphasis commanding European urban policy, the Urban Knowledge Network Asia intends to address critical urban development issues in Asia, taking into account the challenges of the diversity of urban societies, with their heterogeneous populations. The Urban Knowledge Network Asia aims, therefore, to study how Asian cities, taken as organic socio-spatial entities, manage their space and improve human liveability. To this end, the network put together by the International Institute for Asian Studies (IIAS) aims to host a variety of research projects covering three key areas of society in relation to the planning, management and governance of the urban environment: 1) shelter/housing (the house and the neighbourhood where people live), 2) the urban environment and its impact on living conditions, and 3) the city as a cultural nexus.",1,1
266,103564,No,"Molecular architecture of adaptive diffusion in sibling allopolyploid lineages (Dactylorhiza, Orchidaceae)","Hybridization and genome doubling regularly stimulate plant diversification and speciation. Immediately following a polyploidization event, a genome suffers adjustments in organization and function at the genetic and epigenetic levels. These alterations have the potential to induce novel expression patterns, which together with permanent heterozygosity and gene redundancy, might result in significant phenotypic shifts and elevated evolutionary flexibility. Here we aim to screen genome-wide natural diversity in gene expression rates among sibling species in order to identify genes that may drive adaptation to different environments and lead to isolation. By taking advantage of the most recent advances in genomic technologies we will test the theoretical predictions that only a few genetic loci controlling key traits are necessary for rapid ecological diversification. We will use ecologically divergent but related species of Dactylorhiza in their native environmental context as model system. Using previously available parental reference transcriptomes, we will map millions of short reads quantitatively sequenced for several individuals with Illumina. Further, we will look for quantitative patterns correlated with native environmental parameters, as well as loci showing greater between-species expression difference relative to within-species variation. These loci will be further analyzed and their variation characterized, including across transplants. The project will lead to an enhanced appreciation of the effects of polyploidy on the evolution of metabolic pathways that are significant to adaptation and speciation. Finally, it has the potential to provide a drastically new perspective on the links between polyploidy and functional diversity and it will contribute toward a better understanding and hence prediction of the spectrum of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms active at the intraspecific (population) level.",0,0

Even with this assay the sensitivity is low, consequently a collaborative effort involving several laboratories is necessary to measure effects at 10 mGy. A joint venture between AEA, Harwell; GSF, Frankfurt; Nuclear Electric, Berkeley and the Universities of Milan and Wurzburg has been established to carry out such a programme with the following objectives:  to standardize the C3H 10T1/2 cell transformation assay between European laboratories to ensure comparability of results;  to establish the shape of the doseAresponse relationships for survival and transformation of 10T1/2 cells exposed to a range of radiation qualities down to 10 mGy.  Comparison had been made between cell surface proteins from normal C3H/10T1/2 cells and those transformed by either cobalt-60 gamma rays or the chemical carcinogen 3-methylcholantherene (MCA). Membrance proteins from both normal and transformed cells were then analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This led to the detection of consistent differences in membrane protein expression between the normal and transformed cells and in particular the identification of 4 proteins of special interest. These were of approximate molecular weight: 66, 49, 44 and 37 kD, the first of which showed greatest expression in the normal cells and was progressively lost in the transformed cells, whilst the reverse is true of the other 3.  Monoclonal antibodies have been produced against the 4 proteins of interest and commenced by isolating them from the SDS-PAGE gels by electroelution.  Monoclonal antibodies were then raised against a mixture of the 4 proteins using in vitro immunization techniques. By this approach 15 positive clones were identified, all of which were immunglobulin M (IgM) immunoglobulin isotype.  The fine specificity of these 15 monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, even by flow cytometry, only slight differences in antibody reactivity could be detected between normal and transformed cells, whilst the Western blotting indicated that the binding was nonspecific as the antibodies bound to multiple protein bands.  These combined results suggest that the antibodies react with epitopes common to a variety of cell surface proteins rather than to those which are transformation related, thus showing little difference in reactivity between the normal and transformed cells. Continuing work will investigate this problem and attempt to generate antibodies of the desired specificity.  With respect to the standardization of the C3H 10T1/2 transformation assay, cells were prepared for the standardization exercises for the 5 Gy intercomparison. The inverse dose rate effect using 2.2 MeV neutrons was studied and a direct comparison was made of the effect of protons and alpha-particles with the same linear energy transfer (LET).  The intercomparison experiments involved the detection of single transform cells using cell surface markers.  An intensive series of measurements involving the scoring of about 100 foci has shown the possibility of a small enhancement in the effectiveness of low dose rates of 2.2 MeV neutrons. The dose chosen for this comparison was 0.2 Gy given either acutely or over a period of 5 h. It was found that the transformation frequency at the low dose rate was 1.3 times higher than at the high dose rate (95% confidence limits \/-0.27).  In another series of collaborative experiments 10T1/2 cells were irradiated with either 0.5, 1 or 2 Gy of protons and alpha-particles with LET's between 20 and 23 keV um{-1}. No significant difference in the transformation frequencies were seen for other endpoints.  In a comparative investigation the transformation rates of C3H 10T1/2 cells after exposure to chromium K alpha X-rays (5.4 keV) and cobalt-60-gamma rays have been determined. Soft X-rays are more effective than gamma for cell transformation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value for soft X-rays versus gamma-rays was approximately 1.3 in the range of soft X-ray doses from 2 Gy to 5 Gy. There was no recognizable dependence of the RBE on dose, which contrasts the findings with alpha particles. The essential result of this soft X-ray study is that electrons of low energy and of ranges less than 1 um are more effective than fast electrons, not only for cell inactivation but also for cell transformation.  Induction of transformation incidence was examined in C3H 10T1/2 cells after exposure to single and fractionated doses of intermediate and high linear energy transfer (LET) particles, in order to investigate the possible LET dependence of an inversed dose rate effect for cell transformation. Accelerated particles from the RARAF (Columbia University, New York) have been used to expose the cells to a single dose or 3 fractions with different time intervals between the fractions. Doses were chosen leading to surviving fractions of 0.6 to 0.7. The transformation frequency was influenced by extended exposure time for some but not all radiation qualities. Enhancement of transformation was evident for 40, 75, and 120 keV/um when the time between each fraction was greater than 15 min. As LET increases above 25 keV/um, the differences in transformation induction between acute and extended exposures increase to a maximum at 120 keV/um before disappearing at 200 keV/um. Further experiments with helium-4 ions (LET 150 keV/um) and with americium-alpha-particles (LET 147 keV/um) are underway to complete the data. The variation in enhancement with long intervals between fractionation appears to be consistent with a proposed mechanism in which a period of extra sensitivit y exists in the cell cycle (Rossi and Kellerer, 1986)  Research was carried out in order to evaluate parameters which affect the transformation frequency on C3H 10T1/2 cells and techniques were developed for the exposure to C3H 10T1/2 cells to characteristic ultrasoft X-rays. Because of the extremely low range of CK characteristic X-rays special glass dishes with hostaphane foils were used. The glass dishes were made from glass cylinders and hostaphane was stretched across one side of the glass dish and glued to the dish. In order to avoid cells that may be shielded by an excess of glue or by attachment to the glass wall of the dish, a special device was constructed which produces first a ring of puremedium near the wall. Then 0.4 ml of cell suspension was distributed within this ring. After 5 h incubation, when cells are attached to the foil, 1.6 ml of medium was added and the incubation continued for another 48 h. The cell count at this time was about 1.2 E5 and cells were still in exponential growth phase when exposed to the ultrasoft X-rays.  The CK photon beam was vertical and photons entered through the bottom of the glass dish, through the hostaphane foil. The dishes were placed in a holder with the hostaphane foil facing the photon beam. Dosimetry was performed using a special ionization chamber. The dose measurements corresponded to the entrance dose, ie the dose in cells just behind the 1.5 um hostaphane foil. The dose rate amounts to about 5 Gy min{-1}.  For quantitation of cell transformation it was necessary to measure cell survival as a function of dose. C3H 10T1/2 cells attached to the hostphane foil are very flat. The mean thickness of the cell nucleus amounted to about 2 um so that the average dose to the cell nucleus relative to the entrance dose was found to be 0.55. Survivial curves were drawn of C3H 10T1/2 cells after exposure to cobalt-60 gamma rays (reference radiation) and CK photons. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of the CK photons relative to cobalt-60 gamma rays for va rious survival levels of C3H 10T1/2 cells were calculated. The RBE values were dose dependant, mainly due to the less pronounced shoulder in the survival curve obtained after CK photon exposure.  Transformation and inactivation frequencies induced in 10T1/2 cells exposed to 4.3 MeV alpha particles were determined in the range interval between 0.2 and 300 cGy. Survival data are well fitted by an exponential function of the dose with a mean lethal dose value of 0.61\/-0.02 Gy. Transformation frequencies per surviving cell versus dose were calculated. The initial cell density was kept to between 2 and 4 cells/cm{2}. The transformation curve shows a complex behaviour. For less than 0.02 Gy, data are well described by a staight line with an average slope of (8.5\/-2) E-3 Gy{-1}. In this dose region there is a negligible probability for a cell or its nucleus to be hit by 2 independent radiation tracks. Therefore a linear relationship between transformation frequency and dose was expected.  In the interval between 0.02 and 0.2 Gy there is an apparent constancy. This could be explained either by assuming an inducible repair process (in this dose interval the contribution of multiple traversals of the cells becomes significant), or, as due to the phenomena that occur at low doses and tend towards saturation. Such phenomena could be an alteration with its own probability of leading to transformation, or a period in the cell cycle during which the cells are especially sensitive. The analysis of the curve in the light of these models is in progress in the laboratory. Experiments on dose fractionation effect are underway. A total dose of 0.21 Gy was delivered either as a single fraction or as 3 equal fractions at time invervals of 1.5 h between the doses. In each experiment single and fractionated dose were delivered in parallel and with the same experimental conditions. Preliminary results show that transformation frequencies after fractionated exposure are higher than after single exposure by a factor of about 1.3. Initial discussions revealed several differences in the assay procedures used by the participating laboratories:   Comparative evaluation of scoring transformants.   As a first step towards harmonizing the assay procedures each laboratory contributed a selection of culture vessels containing transformed foci from previous experiments. The vessels were then circulated around the laboratories and each laboratory independently recorded the number of foci they considered to be transformed. A comparison between the scores revealed some differences but overall there was good agreement. On the basis of roundtable discussions the criteria for defining a transformed focus was further refined and the criteria for identifying transformants standardized between the participating laboratories.   Intercomparison of experimental protocols.   A comparison of the standard procedures used by the different labs showed some minor differences but it is not clear whether these affected the final  transformation frequency. At this stage, no attempt has been made to derive and impose a consensus standard procedure for the assay, However, certain additional steps have been taken to harmonize the technical procedures used by the different laboratories. In particular, the plating density of viable cells at the beginning of a transformation experiment has, initially, been set to 3 to 5 cellcm{A2}, and a common method of staining the monolayer at the end of the experiment has been adopted.   Multicentre measurement of transformation frequency.   In order to establish whether other differences in technique influence the outcome of a transformation experiment 10T1/2 cells irradiated at one laboratory will be shipped to the other participants who will then perform a transformation assay according to their normal procedures. Preliminary studies on the optimum method of shipping the cells, by the University of Wurzburg and Berkeley, revealed that they travelled best at 0 C in an ice-water mixture. Using this procedure, recovery was high and the plating efficiency was unaffected by 48 hours in transit. Freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by shipping on dry ice was unsatisfactory; recovery was poor and the plating efficiency was reduced by approximately 50%, irradiated and unirradiated cells being affected to the same extent.   Future objectives:   Having established the feasibility of shipping irradiated cells between the participants with no loss of viability 10T1/2 cells will be irradiated with 5 Grays at one centre and shipped to each participant along with appropriate controls. Each participant will initiate a transformation assay from the cells in parallel, with a transformation assay using their own cells as an internal control. The results will be reviewed and, if necessary, the experimental procedures revised to achieve greater uniformity. If the results are in reasonable agreement (ie no significant difference between the labs so the results can be pooled), the procedure will be repeated for a dose of 1 Gy and subsequently in steps to lower doses, the final target being 10 mGy.",0,0

Besides, I will account for within-countries differences through a representative examination of the main ethnic groups within each country under examination. In the second part I am going to add an additional dimension of comparison - secondary analysis of survey data from the third wave of the World Values for the above mentioned south-east European countries, some Western countries (former West Germany and Spain), and several Central European post-communist countries (Poland, former East Germany and Estonia). Thus, the Western and the Central European post-communist countries will be used as a point of reference through which the peculiarities of the Balkan political culture and its relation to interethnic understanding will be revealed in a best way.

144,215004,No,Warrior Elites: Assessing their Presence and Organisational identity in Neolithic Europe,"The origins of human conflict, up to and including warfare, lie not in historical documents but in the prehistoric archaeological record. While some evidence is ambiguous, injuries to the skeleton are the indisputable result of real incidents. Neolithic (6000-3000 BC) graves of the Mid-Upper Ebro and Mid-Upper Rhine valleys (northern Spain and northeastern France, respectively) contain skeletons with skeletal trauma and/or arrowhead injuries. Some of these may represent massacres involving many individuals. Moreover, emerging isotopic evidence suggests the existence of specialised warriors among them – potentially the first such in Europe. This reflects a rise in social unrest and provides an outstanding opportunity for investigating almost intangible cultural aspects. The WEAPON (Warrior Elites: Assessing their Presence and Organisational identity in Neolithic Europe) project proposes an unprecedented interdisciplinary approach to explore the identity and life-histories of those involved in the violence observed in this pivotal period. A combination of analytical methods will be used to this end, including stable carbon, nitrogen and sulphur analysis of bone collagen and tooth dentine, strontium and oxygen analysis of tooth enamel, and radiocarbon dating. The research aims to confirm the existence of ‘specialised warriors’, as well as to investigate if violence, whether regular or not, may relate to the emergence of inequalities and/or population movements across Neolithic Europe.",0,0

Research has documented the experiences of migrants in different contexts, as part of a broad concern with issues of social integration a nd inclusion. Many migrant groups include a significant population of children and young people, but very little research has focused specifically on their experiences of integration.This research programme aims to contribute to understandings of immigrati on and integration among children and young people in contemporary Irish society. It seeks to map the social worlds of migrant children and youth at the local level in different contexts. The research will produce in-depth analysis of the nature and extent of integration, drawing on current ideas of transnationalism, citizenship and geographies of childhood, and will propose recommendations. The research programme will be interdisciplinary in nature, primarily qualitative, and will involve four interrelated strands: (1) labour migrants, (2) EU citizens, (3) asylum-seekers and refugees and (4) Irish return migrants. A child-centred approach will be adopted and will include participatory research techniques. The findings will have direct relevance for other EU countries, in particular new member states, which may experience similar social and economic transformations in the future. Researchers will be recruited from across the social sciences and the EU. They will have expertise in the relevant field, relevant language skills and knowledge of the major sending countries for migrants to Ireland (particularly eastern European countries). Therefore the research team will be interdisciplinary and international. The research will promote the EU as a research hub in t his area, will contribute to improved research careers and mobility in the EU, and will contribute to integration of citizens of new EU states.",1,0

428,217520,No,Empirical Analyses of Markets for Consumer Financial Products and their Effects,"This proposal presents three broad projects on information frictions in households' credit markets and on the consequences of these frictions for durable good markets. Specifically, an influential theoretical literature in information economics has shown that borrowing constraints can arise in equilibrium when borrowers and lenders have asymmetric information about borrowers' risks. Hence, the first project aims to provide the first empirical analyses of markets (i.e., demand and supply) with asymmetric information and nonexclusive trades---i.e., markets in which households can purchase multiple insurance contracts, such as in life insurance markets, or can open multiple credit lines, such as in credit card markets. The second project aims to study recent regulations of fees and prices in markets for consumer financial products, such as mortgages, that could have the unintended consequences of increasing households' cost of credit and, thus, of tightening their borrowing constraints. Finally, the third project aims to study the role of borrowing constraints in durable goods markets, with a special focus on car markets during the Great Recession.  All these projects aim to develop and estimate structural models using data from different markets. I further plan to use the estimated structural parameters to perform counterfactual policy analyses in each of the specific markets analyzed in these projects.",0,0
699,207818,No,A model to study how social interaction modulates sleep in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,"Sleep is a fascinating phenomenon and one of the least understood mysteries of biology. It is universal among the animal kingdom and most species devote a large part of their day to sleep, despite the risks of lowering their defenses against predators or not engaging in more productive activities such as foraging or mating. In many animals, social interaction is a powerful modulator of sleep quality and quantity. In nature, animals are continuously exposed to a diverse variety of stimuli, and interactions with con-specifics represent a particularly relevant set of them. For Drosophila males, interaction with females is key to ensure reproduction, while interaction with other males can create antagonistic fights to compete for sexual partners, food or shelter.  Through this project, I propose to investigate if and how social interactions affect sleep need and sleep quality. Employing fruit flies it has been previously shown that male-male interaction during the night builds up sleep pressure, observable in the next day as marked increase in sleep. Recovery of sleep after sleep deprivation is also called “sleep rebound”, and in all species it is thought to be 1) at the basis of sleep homeostasis and 2) positively correlate with sleep deprivation. The longer an animal stay awake, the higher the sleep pressure and following rebound. Also, it has been described that previous sleep experience modulates antagonistic behaviours between males. Thus, bidirectional interplay between social interaction and sleep appears as a promising framework to address a main goal of modern neuroscience, understand how sleep is regulated and which sleep functions are. I intend to use new developed behavioural paradigms and software that improve sleep analysis in combination with refined genetic tools available in Drosophila to extend our knowledge on the interaction between phylogenetically conserved behaviours, social interactions and sleep, which have a high impact on reproductive fitness.",0,0
806,201229,No,How to deal with how you feel: Understanding and training context-dependent emotion regulation,"Emotion regulation refers to the variety of processes through which people attempt to influence their emotions. The ability to effectively regulate emotions is key to psychological wellbeing, and emotion dysregulation is a central element of mood disorders. The existing research tends to paint emotion regulation strategies as either adaptive or maladaptive, but increasingly researchers are beginning to realize that this characterization is an oversimplification. Instead, responding with the right strategy in the right context is key for adaptive regulation and, hence, for mental health. However, there is very little empirical investigation of how context shapes the use and effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies. In this application, we propose to first establish who uses what emotion regulation strategy when (i.e. the context) and to what effect, using innovative smartphone assessment methods to examine these processes in daily life. Second, we propose using this information about context as input to train people to use the right strategy at the right time using a smartphone application, with an aim to improve mental health.",0,0
857,198650,No,Culture And RISkmanagement in Man-made And Natural Disasters,"As risks are not “objective” but socially and culturally constructed, disaster management which is aware, respects, and makes use of local cultural aspects will be not only more effective but, at the same time, also improve the community’s disaster coping capacities. CARISMAND is setting out to identify these factors, to explore existing gaps and opportunities for improvement of disaster policies and procedures, and to develop a comprehensive toolkit which will allow professional as well as voluntary disaster managers to adopt culturally-aware everyday practices. This goal will be achieved by approaching the links, and gaps, between disaster management, culture and risk perception from the broadest possible multi-disciplinary perspective and, simultaneously, developing a feedback-loop between disaster management stakeholders and citizens to establish, test, and refine proposed solutions for culturally-informed best practices in disaster management. Whilst experts from a variety of fields (in particular legal, IT, cognitive science, anthropology, psychology, sociology) will undertake a comprehensive collation of existing knowledge and structures, a number of Citizen Summits and Stakeholder Assemblies will be organised. Systematically, CARISMAND will use an approach that examines natural, man-made and technical disasters, placing at the centre of attention specific aspects that affect culturally informed risk perceptions, eg whether disasters are caused intentionally or not, the different “visibility” of hazards, and various time scales of disasters such as slow/fast onset and short- and long-term effects. By organising six Citizen Summits (two per disaster category per year in two separate locations) where such disaster risks are prevalent , and three Stakeholder Assemblies (one per year) where the results are discussed through a wide cross-sectional knowledge transfer between disaster managers from different locations as well as from different cultural backgrounds.",1,0

Those ordinary people became the biggest hotel group in the world with 2.3 million rooms - Marriott group, which has recently acquired Starwood Hotels, could only became the second with 1.1 million rooms. [i]  AirBnb has not acquired 18% penetration in the market just providing a marketplace with a fancy mobile app and web site, but advice and services to help its providers with their business efforts e.g. sending a professional photographer to get the best images captured or reporting the pricing of competition per neighbourhood, per seasonality etc. to let the provider set the right price. Airbnb helped these people with their business and their engagement with the guests. Then became a $30 billion company[ii] helping its providers make $12.3 billion each year.[iii]  “Airbnb for the Hotel Industry” would be an appropriate analogy for Home2nite.  Independent hotels in EU represent 67% of the room supply counting for more than €35 billion [8] economic value for the region.

520,193217,Yes,Sustainable Urban Consolidation CentrES for conStruction,"Currently freight transport represents 40% of the total transport emission and 32% in urban area. Many initiatives are under development to reduce costs and negative impact of freight and service trip in urban area. Some of them concern supply chain improvements and more specifically consolidation centre projects. Few study cases are dedicated to construction industry. However, urban population tends to grow, increasing the need to develop and reconstruct urban centres. Construction material logistic impact in urban area will intensify in terms of costs and negative impacts in urban area. Yet, only few experiences of Construction Consolidation Centres can be found. Among these initiatives, four are construction site specific (Stockholm, Utrecht, Berlin, London Heathrow) and only one is dedicated to several construction projects (London CC). Theses pilots studies have demonstrated reduced transportation impacts, positive effects on transportation efficiency and construction site productivity. Several limitations to the transferability of this concept are identified: one on hand the demonstrators were implemented in specific contexts (regulatory incentives, cities investment contribution, and specifics transport and logistics infrastructure issues) which are not the same in France, Spain, Italy and Luxembourg. On the other hand, economic viability has not been demonstrated. The project addresses the different requirements for transferability of supply chain optimization concepts as well as CCCs and new ways of working between supply chain stakeholders. The approach is to identify an integrated collaborative approach and business model among construction supply chain actors. Three main steps will be performed: analyse the current issues along the construction supply chain, propose several optimization scenarios regarding these issues, simulate and analyse costs optimization and environmental impacts to propose new partnership opportunities based on savings distribution.",1,1
1175,223775,No,Single-step disentanglement and fractionation of microalgal high-value products through acoustophoresis,"Next generation biomass resources such as marine seaweed and micro-algae have advantages in comparison to terrestrial lignocellulosic biomass as they can grow on non-arable land at higher areal productivities. Aquatic biomass can provide renewable energy (e.g. biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas) as well as high-value molecules such as carotenoids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and food fibres, which can be used in food, feed, cosmetics, biomaterials, nanostructures and pharmaceutical industries. However, in order to greatly increase the economic viability of aquatic biomass, all components found in the biomass need to be valorized. Unfortunately, valorization of multiple biomass components is not possible using current/conventional biorefinery technologies, where up to 90% of the biomass is being treated as a waste. The value of these broken-down compounds sees more than a ten-fold reduction, rendering the biorefinery economically unfeasible. Therefore, in furtherance of developing multiproduct biorefineries, selective and economically feasible extraction and separation technologies will need to be developed and implemented. Significant microalgal cell disruption and extraction advances have been recently made by employing external fields such as lasers, ultrasonic waves and microwaves, in combination with less aggressive solvents and ionic liquids. However, the issues regarding the use of chemicals and multiple separation stages remain. Thus, we are proposing a game-changing single-step disentanglement and separation of microalgal high-value components by using acoustic waves at different frequencies allowing thus a complete process fine-tuning and eliminating the need for chemicals. Moreover, by including our previously-developed ultrasound disruption technology, the whole cell breakdown, extraction and separation steps could be reduced to one single process governed and finely-tuned through the employed frequency ranges.",0,0
682,192112,No,"Continuous monitoring systems for the SAFE storage, distribution and usage of Hydrogen POWER for transport","The limited supplies of traditional fossil fuels and environmental damage caused by their CO2 emissions have caused a growing interest in the exploitation of renewable energy sources. By far the most promising replacement fuel for road transport is hydrogen because of its abundance, efficiency, low footprint for carbon and the absence of other harmful emissions. In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.  Because hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise. Particularly, the project goal is to develop novel tangential neutron radiography and acoustic emission (AE) techniques in combination for the reliable and cost effective continuous monitoring of the integrity of hydrogen storage tanks at central depots, service stations and on vehicles i.e. at every point of hydrogen storage along the supply chain from the production plant to the fuel tank on a hydrogen powered vehicle.

600,85731,Yes,Centrope ICT Technology Transfer Project,"The co-operation within the Central European region called Centrope – bordering regions of Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia - should trigger challenges and broaden the circle of experts to build a region that will become a model for European integration process.     The project CITT triggers challenges in the ICT sector by providing a strategy to improve technology transfer between the business and research communities within the Centrope region in order to support its growth.   The project’s backgrounds are several key elements in the area of research driven sectors which weaken a knowledge driven economy:   1) Lack of relevant information and awareness on the side of policy makers especially on a regional level and therefore limited commitment and/or engagement to implement new policy tools.   2)  Centralised system which often do not reflect regional specification.    3)  Barriers in the interaction between business and academia.    In order to overcome national, institutional and mental problems linked to technology transfer in the area of digital technologies, it is the aim of the project to demonstrate their viability in best practice examples and offering a strategy within defined regional limits which should, however, be able to be up scaled to the benefit of the entire Union.    Simultaneously, the project will identify relevant players in ICT industry and R&D which so far have not been categorised in this way. A database containing such information will represent a unique resource valuable to (Central) Europe’s economy.  The project partners will provide solutions for improved technology transfer between the research and business communities as well as for mentoring and coaching of the research and business communities (based on mutual approach). Thus, the project tries to overcome increased competition for the same resources in the globalised economy.   Experience in the Centrope region has shown that cross-border cooperation provides an ideal impulse for further development of the area and for further strengthening of its position in a global market. Creating of a strategy for a cross-border ICT network will provide support for a dynamic development of the region as the national borders are loosing their significance.",0,1

The European urban corridor control (EUROCOR) project involves the development and implementation (by field trials on 2 test sites) of models and online control strategies for the effective management of traffic in urban corridors (integrated urban networks and motorways).  A literature review was performed, addressing existing urban, interurban and corridor traffic models and control tools, potentially suited for developing and evaluating advanced traffic control strategies within an integrated motorway/arterial urban corridor. The review included a preliminary screening of 67 candidate models and 30 control tools followed by a more detailed evaluation process that resulted in 6 short listed models, which appear suitable for the project's purposes and were recommended for further analysis, modification and application.  After the review evaluation, 2 of the short listed models (namely SSMT and METANET) have been finally selected for integration. Model integration included specifications, theoretical investigations, software development, and preliminary testing. The integrated corridor traffic model was given the name METACOR and will be used in the near future for offline testing of control strategies. Moreover, a further 4 short listed models will be used in the course of the project's investigations for one or both network sites. A feasibility study for the 2 test sites was performed, consisting of the networks statement, the control techniques statement, the application details, and the evaluation requirements and procedures. The final part of this feasibility study was the comparative appraisal where both sites were compared with respect to their requirements and characteristics.  Last achievement has been the development of preliminary functional and architectural requirements for both sites as well as the first field trial results related to the assessment of the impact of ramp metering on the Urban Corridor Peripherique traffic. Technical Approach   The overall technical approach includes specification, system analysis, software development, implementation, and evaluation of integrated urban corridor modelling and control tools. A main intention is to establish flexible control approaches for urban corridors, to allow for different operational requirements in different corridor situations so as to encourage wide application of effective urban corridor control management. The work programme to be carried out within the project will allow both the development of the basic tools for corridor modelling and control and their application to real interactive motorway/urban route situations.   The application areas are two corridor sites which have partially different user requirements, traffic and environmental conditions and road and network characteristics. The different implementation tasks will have their own timing and method for each site, but a coordinated plan has been specified both to guarantee the achievement of the primary overall objectives and to ensure that the evaluation procedures lead to results that allow direct comparison between sites. Moreover, as much of the work as possible will be made common to both sites, in order to optimise the use of the resources available.   The project structure includes seven main stages: Review and assessment, feasibility, development and validation, off-line studies, on-line implementation, evaluation and recommendations.   The first stage was a critical review of corridor systems and urban and interurban control tools. In the second stage all aspects of the feasibility of implementing the intended control approach on the test sites were examined. This has been followed by the necessary development and off-line studies and will lead to the most important stage of the project, namely the on-site implementation and evaluation of the control approach. The final task will be to produce recommendations, based on the results of the evaluation studies, for the generalized application of urban corridor control throughout Europe, including operational specifications.   Key Issues   Enhancement of existing macroscopic simulation models.  Integration of urban traffic models with inter-urban traffic flow models.  Evaluation of the impact of ramp metering on the Urban Corridor Traffic  Development of tools for use in the on-line control of urban corridors  Validation of the new modelling approaches, in isolation, against appropriate existing real data and their subsequent integration into a single model for application to on-line control.  Specification and development of the necessary on-line control software.  Implementation through appropriate pilot projects of the on-line control on two urban corridor sites in Paris and in Amsterdam, each having partially different characteristics in terms of geometric structure and traffic demand.  Detailed evaluation of the field trials.  Recommendations for the implementation of urban corridor control by using RTI systems.   Expected Achievements   The METACOR Urban Corridor model will be validated, while the traffic assignment modelling, the integrated control design, the off-line simulation testings, the overall integrated system architecture and the field trials specifications, design and evaluation will be performed, during the lifetime of the project.   Expected Impact   The main purpose of EUROCOR is the development and demonstration of an integrated traffic control strategy using urban and inter-urban control tools.   The impact of the project could be significant if it can:   satisfy the requirements of users and operators for more efficient traffic control  develop marketable prototypes.   Furthermore, a specific emphasis will be to provide easy and cost effective solutions for the application of new RTI systems developed in the field of traffic control.   Finally the EUROCOR approach shall reflect the need to come as early as possible to European - Internationally accepted traffic control strategies and specifications permitting the development of a universal environment of RTI based traffic control system.   In the technological area, EUROCOR will try to link the strategies for urban control with those for interurban control, by applying them to the sites and therefore improving the information exchange between the various 'actors' in the traffic scene, and offering a 'package' solution of obvious European value.   Contribution to Standardization   During the planning and execution of the EUROCOR pilots, various existing standards will be applied and tested in practice.   The whole work will contribute within its scope of application to a wide range of topics including:   Functional specifications  Recommendation for standards  Evaluation of operability of Road transport informatics in Europe  Recommendations regarding safety aspects  Commercial use and benefits of Road transport informatics in Europe",1,0
776,13809,No,ENGINEERING OF AN EXTRACELLULAR RIBONUCLEASE BY GENE MODIFICATION,"MODEL SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPMENT OF RATIONAL APPROACHES FOR PROTEIN ENGINEERING BY COMBINED GENETIC, STRUCTURAL AND MODELLING TECHNIQUES.  THE ADVANTAGE OF BARNASE IS THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY SMALL TO BE READILY STUDIED BY N.M.R. AND X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. IT CAN BE HOPED THAT A DETAILED STUDY OF THIS PROTEIN WILL LEAD TO THE ELUCIDATION OF RULES GOVERNING PROTEIN FOLDING. THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE RULES IS A MAJOR BATTLENECK WHICH MAKES IMPOSSIBLE THE DESIGN OF NOVEL PROTEINS.  The ribonuclease excreted by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Barnase, was cocrystallised with the deoxydinucleotide d(GpC). The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement from a model of free Barnase previously derived by Mauguen et al. Refinement was carried out using data to 1.9 angstroms resolution. The final model, which has a crystallographic R factor of 22%, includes 869 protein atoms, 38 atoms from d(GpC), a sulphate ion and 73 water molecules. Only minor differences from free Barnase are seen in the protein moiety, the root mean square C-alpha movement being 0.45 angstroms. The dinucleotide has a folded conformation. It is located near the active site of the enzyme, but outside the protein molecule and making crystal packing contacts with neighbouring molecules. The guanine base is stacked on the imidazole ring of active site His102, rather than binding to the so called recognition loop as it does in other complexes of guanine  nucleotides with microbial nucleases. The deoxyguanosine is syn, with the sugar ring in C-2'-endo conformation; the deoxycytidine is anti and C-4'-exo. In addition to the stacking interaction, His102 hydrogen bonds to the free 5' hydroxyl, which is located near the position with the 3' phosphate group is found in other inhibitors of microbial ribonucleases. While the mode of binding observed with d(GpC) and Barnase would be nonproductive for a dinucleotide substrate, it may define a site for the nucleotide product on the 3' side of the hydrolysed bond.  Research was carried out in order to develop rational approaches for engineering modified protein using genetic engineering techniques. Sequence modifications were made in barnase (a small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) to probe the catalytic mechanism in the ribonucleases about which appreciable controversy persists and to dissect the contributions from hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions to protein stability. Mutations were also used as reporter groups in kinetic studies of protein folding to provide information on the conformation of the transition state for unfolding. Crystallographic analysis was performed on the enzyme complex with a deoxydinucleotide inhibitor (dGpC). Molecular modelling was used to help interpret data on protein nucleic acid interactions and catalysis, and contributions of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to protein stability were analysed by computer simulations. Interactions of barnase with its intracellular protein inhibitor, barstar, were studied via random mutagenesis of the barstar gene.  Parameters of the enzyme catalyzed reaction were determined for short nucleotides and ribonucleic acid (RNA) substrates, and shown to be significantly different. Residues of barnase responsible for catalysis were established. The structure of the complex of barnase with a deoxydinucleotide inhibitor was solved. It shows an unproductive binding mode for the dinucleotide involving enzyme subsites that are different from the primary recognition site for guanine in related ribonucleases. Based on these results, molecular modelling was used to study the interaction of the enzyme with RNA analogues, and to rationalize the catalytic mechanism. Appreciable progress was made in understanding how hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions contribute to protein stability and on the physical origins of the observed effects. An arginine and a cysteine residue in barstar (respectively in positions 75 and 40) were both identified as participating in the barnase barstar interaction.

904,70297,No,Technology and social visions for europe's energy future - a europe wide delphi study (EURENDEL),"Objectives and Problems to be solved: EURENDEL assess long-term developments in energy technologies, their potentials and expected impacts. The perspective taken integrates a technology push with a social pull approach embracing a time horizon of 30 years. The liberalisation of the energy sector, the increasing amount of trans national research as well as rapid technology developments challenge today's innovation systems and demand a greater integration and cohesion into EU-wide innovation strategies. EURENDEL employs a Union-wide Delphi survey to cover the need for reliable information on long-term trends and developments. Thus the project provides orientation knowledge and technical foresight to promote a sustainable European energy sector. Description of the Work: The core of EURENDEL is a Europe-wide Delphi survey with two rounds of expert consultations. The Delphi method is an appropriate approach not only to gain a consensual-based technological foresight, but also to integrate technological, social and economic perspectives of sustainable development. According to these two main foci, EURENDEL simultaneously examines how social requirements and technological developments exert influence on the speed, thrust and centre of innovation. The knowledge gathered allows an analysis of both what might happen in the future and what has to be done to secure long-term competitiveness and enhanced quality of life. In a first step, the state of the art of energy technology development in the EU Member and Accession States is defined. Future relevant issues are identified in expert interviews. In contrast to this technological push perspective, a social pull approach is endorsed, by analysing socio-economic trends. Concerns and opportunities regarding social developments are gathered in a 'Futures Workshop' to extract future social demands. The most important issues are accentuated as Delphi statements. They provide the basis for a standardized questionnaire, which is mailed to 2,000 European experts. The data gathered is analysed and subsequently returned to the participants for revaluation. A thorough evaluation of both rounds is conducted to assess the major Europe- wide technological trends, social requirements, challenges and possible solutions. Expected Results and Exploitation Plans: A consensual and systematic assessment of future energy technology developments on EU level including the expected range of diffusion, chances and constraints is carried out. EURENDEL provides orienting knowledge and technical input to the European Union considerations with respect to installing an appropriate framework, which promotes a sustainable development of the energy sector. Additionally, it advances a better understanding of the dynamics and determinants of technological development in different energy environments. It supports enterprises in their efforts to develop customised products and gives industrial and municipal decision makers an information basis for energy related planning. During the survey process all findings are open to public access on the project web site. In a series of national and Europe-wide workshops the results of the survey are disseminated and a lively discussion on appropriate measures to strengthen the EU innovation system is set off.",0,0

791,48337,No,GNSS - VALUE ADDED SERVICES FOR TRANSPORT,"The overall objectives of the VAST project for all modes of transports are the following: * to identify, given future GNSS options, the main present and future commercial applications of satellite navigation services, whether or not  they be combined with other means of navigation, communication or information systems, * to assess the associated potential market for each identified application, * to assess the willingness to pay of each category of potential users for identified applications, * to propose and assess cost recovery schemes against financial profitability, implementation feasibility and public acceptability, * to propose and assess Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in a position to recover funds from commercial applications to finance (part of) GNSS2 development and operation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:  The numerous services generated by the integration of satellite navigation systems into transport have a great potential to support the transport efficiency, which is a priority for the European Union. This leads to an important market of commercial applications (see hereafter) in all modes of transport where the number of potential users is extremely important, where a large demand already exists and where the development of positioning systems based on Galileo seems promising. The identification of the market, the analysis of the potential benefits and the possibility to recover costs from those Value Added Services (VAS) should contribute to state on the feasibility to approach a self-financing of GNSS on the medium term and to assess the different options for public private partnership. In that context, the VAST project has concentrated on providing appropriate information in order to help the European Commission to take relevant decisions.  Identification of GNSS applications: The first work package of the VAST project has identified a very large number of present, emerging and latent GNSS applications and their related VAS. It points out that all kinds of domains (road, maritime, rail e.g.) and users (single private, single professional, haulage companies e.g.) are concerned by satellite navigation and shows an increasing level of interest for this technology. The road transport segment is the most significant segment both in terms of number of applications (more than 50 applications have been identified) and number of potential users, and should be the leading satellite navigation market in the coming years. As regards user requirements, the accuracy level required for most applications identified in the framework of the VAST project does not seem to be a critical point. However, integrity and service guarantees are often stringent parameters, especially when safety critical aspects are at stake. Finally, the current need for many applications to have a reliable communication service, in order to maintain the full functioning of the related application, has been clearly underscored. Present and future market for VAS. The second work package has identified the present and future market for VAS over the period 2000/2020. An important output is that current trends in technology field are re-shaping future scenarios. In other words, market players have to deal with two different developments: * a first scenario, based on the assumption that the 'Next Generation GPS' will remain the core of the GNSS; * a second scenario, based on the hypothesis of a successful deployment of GALILEO. The results on the supply structure show that presently market players' behaviour is directly influenced by the uncertainty outlined above. The assessment of market players' behaviour has highlighted different positions with regard to the opportunity to support the EU strategies of development. The main demand requirements is already perceivable and is similar to those observed in similar market (i.e. mobile telecommunications). The final output of this second phase is the assessment of the potential market over the period 2000-2020 based on different scenarios. The market dimension trends in monetary terms for both the equipment and applications have been estimated using current average market prices and a technology-driven approach for assessing Value Added Services. The forecasted market for the equipment in road segment starts from about 700 million Euro and arrives at 3.5 billion Euro in 2008, in terms of cumulated revenues. For multimodal and rail transport the revenues will reach respectively 240 million Euro and 80 million Euro in 2008. The forecasted market for Value Added Services and applications in road segment will rise from 5 billion Euro (in 2002) to more than 40 billion Euro (in 2020). In multimodal segment the market will probably reach more than 5 billion Euro in 2020. In aviation, rail and maritime segments, the market will arrive respectively to 900 million Euro, 680 million Euro and 150 million Euro.  Recoverable costs: The assessed annual benefits (defined as the reduction of costs and/or the increase of profit by using satellite navigation applications) of satellite navigation for European end users are estimated at 15 billion Euro in 2008 increasing to 53 billion Euro in 2017. These figures exceed the cost of the Galileo system by far (averagely a factor 50). From this we can conclude that, from economical point of view, the argument to develop Galileo in order to make European economy less dependent on GPS is a valuable argument. Benefits will mainly occur in the road segment, which is by far the transport segment with the largest potential user group. The benefits in the road segment are mainly related to open access services where the competition or co-operation with GPS will be of significant importance. Benefits in other transport segments are more related to controlled access services and are expected to appear later in time because regulatory and institutional barriers may delay the acceptance of the safety and security level. The assessed annual turnover (of the European industry from world wide sales of Galileo products and services) in Europe increases from around 500 million Euro in 2008 to 2.6 billion Euro in 2017. World-wide, the turnover increases from 1.5 billion Euro to 7.6 billion Euro. So, the potential recoverable costs exceed the annual operation costs of Galileo. However, since only a minor fraction of these potential recoverable costs could actually flow back to the Galileo investors, we must conclude that the system will not pay for itself. When we assume that 1% of the turnover can flow back (by a general levy on the world-wide sales of receivers and equipment) to the Galileo investors, recoverable costs would increase over the years from 15 million Euro in 2008 to 76 million Euro in 2017. Under this assumption, it is important to underscore that, at the same time, tax on sales income to the government will allow considerably bigger benefits assessed at 265 million Euro in 2008 to 1,323 million Euro in 2017. Restricted to the sales to European end users, the recoverable costs increase over the years from 5 million Euro in 2008 to 26 million Euro in 2017. Tax on sales income to the government increases from 88 million Euro in 2008 to 174 million Euro in 2017.  Public Private Partnership: Based on the generic characteristics of PPP schemes three Galileo PPP models have been selected (private concession, shared concession, joint venture) and matched towards the identified future market structures (payment), risk factors and financial mechanisms: Finance: Although Public Private Partnership arrangements can be used to reduce the overall cost for the Galileo programme, substantial public investments will be required throughout the programme lifetime. However, the relative level of necessary public financial involvement will change in different phases of Galileo programme (as the result of changing risks) - from the very significant one in the early stages of the programme to more moderate, or potentially very low in operational phase. Risks: There seems to be a slight tendency towards that the private sector has the competencies to manage and control the technical, market and financial risk factors, while the public sector has the competencies to manage organisational, political, regulatory, legal and administrative risks, which should make it possible to negotiate a rather clear risk allocation. However, especially in the first phases (definition, design) it is difficult to assess the extent and consequences of many risk factors, while the allocation of the identified risks seems to be easier to allocate in the build and operation phases. Payment: The forecasted payment and market structure of Galileo indicate that the definition and the beginning of the design phase could be set-up as a joint venture (joint undertaking) as the risks in this period are quite significant. When the design (test and validation) and building (deployment) phase is entered a more precise risk allocation should be reached, which means that this period probably could be best suited with a concession contract with quite even public and private participations. Revenues are still too small in this period to set-up a more private dominated (up to 100%) concession contract. When Galileo is fully operational up to 100% private investment (concession model) should be initiated, which stimulate satellite manufacturers, service providers and other down-stream actors to join the consortium. This could be done by selling shares of the Galileo Vehicle Company to service providers in the operational phase and thereby gradually evolve the concession into a nearly 100% private concession contract, when the system is fully operational and revenues are granted with limited risks. The final hypothesis of the study is that: * Joint ventures (joint undertakings) will be suitable for the design phase as risk factors are difficult to allocate ex-ante, * Shared concession: is suitable for the building phase as risks can be allocated, while the need for cash flow increases, no market revenues are generated and the need for public finance is substantial, * Private concession: is suitable for the operation phase as risks decreases and should be easy to allocate, market revenues increases, the need for public finance decreases and private investments raise.  In conclusion, VAST is the first project dealing with all economical and organizational problems (requirements, market, cost recovery and PPP) linked to the implementation of a European satellite navigation infrastructure. Moreover, the VAST outcomes have been already used as relevant inputs for the definition phase of Galileo.  EXPLOITATION AND DISSEMINATION PLANS Firstly, project results have been presented to a panel of service providers and industrialists during the completion of the project. They have shown particular interest in these results and asked to receive a copy of the final reports. One first task of the Galileo definition phase was to identify and classify potential Galileo applications and assess the related market. In that context, VAST results were considered and used as inputs of major importance. Finally, VAST reports when approved by the Commission will be included in the Genesis database. It will provide the means to for industrialist organisation to have access to these information under the control of the European Commission. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The overall objective of this project was to assess the expected benefits of commercial applications of GNSS in transport with an emphasis on road and multimodal transport.  The first step of this study was to identity and provide a description of current, emerging and latent applications and their associated VAS (Value Added Services). To achieve this objective, 'desk study', survey by direct interviews among a selection of representative players and brainstorming sessions have been performed. All results of this first step have been compiled in a database. The second step of the VAST project was to assess the present, the future structure and the dimension of the GNSS market in the European Union from 2000 up to 2020. This has been reached performing surveys and direct interviews with major players of the navigation field and using relevant other studies as inputs. The third step was to analyse the potential return of investment for a European contribution to Galileo. Cost recovery schemes had been performed taking into account financial profitability, implementation feasibility and public acceptability. The results of the three first phases have been the basis of the fourth step which proposes different PPP models in a position to recover funds from commercial applications to finance (part of) Galileo development and operation phases. During the project a panel of service providers has been organised to validate the VAST outcomes. In practical terms, each step of the study corresponds to a work package ( WP1, WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5). Management activities have been carried out  for the entire duration of the project (WP6). The following figure (Figure 1) illustrates the work package breakdown as well as the relationship between the work packages and the work phases mentioned above.",1,0

129,101697,No,Numerical Modelling of Artificial Ground Freezing,"The project focuses on the theoretical and applied study of freezing soils in the context of the use of Artificial Ground Freezing (AGF) in excavations and underground construction. The ever-increasing density of urban environments poses new challenges to tunnelling for transit projects. This implies the necessity to carry out open excavations and bored tunnels in the urban environment, often in difficult ground and almost always in the close vicinity of existing buildings and structures. As a test case, the project examines the geotechnical aspects of excavation of Line 1 of Napoli Underground. The work was performed in the urban environment of one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. Monitoring included an extensive set of in-situ data (e.g. buildings displacements, temperature in the ground). The main objectives of the project are: a deeper understanding of the AGF process and of the effects of thawing frozen ground; development of a novel constitutive model and coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) formulation to provide an accurate description of the engineering behaviour of frozen/unfrozen soils; comparison between laboratory and field tests to calibrate the thermal properties of the ground, collection and back analysis of an extensive set of in-situ monitored data from a real urban tunnelling project. The most innovative aspect of the project is the way in which theoretical developments, constitutive modelling, laboratory tests, in situ monitoring and coupled analysis will be integrated in a single consistent framework firmly grounded on basic physical principles. The generality of the formulation and of the developed analysis tool allows the enhancement of the field of applications from AGF to the wider range of engineering and environmental problems involving frozen soils such as the analysis of frost heave, the study of the effect of freezing-thawing cycles in cold regions or the prediction of the permafrost fate in a climate change scenario.",0,0
1135,53606,No,Development and applications of new built-in-test software COMPONENTs in European industries,"Component-based software engineering is a new approach to programming and software development. The conventional technologies for in-house and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software components development are mainly based on object-oriented (OO) techniques. The Built-In Test (BIT) components for self-testable and test-reusable COTS and in-house components are a cutting edge technology developed by the proposers. BIT technology is considered to be a significant extension of OO technology to self-testable and test-reusable software in component-based software engineering. The COMPONENT\ project proposes the further development of BIT technology for component-based software engineering, and intends to widen application of the new technology in the European software industry. BIT components have been found extremely useful for OO software and COTS development. As a result, the COMPONENT\ project will establish European R&D and industry partners as the driving force for the development of new technologies component-based software engineering and will place Europe in the vanguard of global implementation.

430,16942,No,Motorway Traffic Flow Monitoring and Control,"The principal goal of this project is to define and build prototypes of systems for ramp metering control and variable traffic information on urban (linear and networked) motorways. Ramp metering distributes a given demand in space and time by influencing traffic volumes (traffic lights); message signs can be used to inform drivers and so divert them onto alternative routes to prevent or reduce congestion. The existence of adequate macroscopic mathematical models for freeway traffic is a prerequisite for the development of traffic monitoring and efficient control strategies. 2 macroscopic traffic flow simulation models (SIMAUT and META) for linear motorway, one based on the kinematic wave theory and the second based on a state space framework, have been selected for improvement and comparative assessment on a linear motorway based on real data from 2 French sites and 1 British motorway.  Linear simulation was then extended to motorway networks with 2 simulation packages being developed. The network simulation program METANET was extended and improved to give simulation tool for broad use. METANET uses a macroscopic modelling approach to consider multiple origin, multiple destinations and network phenomena. The computational effort is low, hence the model can be used online for monitoring and control purposes. The development of a motorway network version of the well known simulation package CONTRAM, called MCONTRM, was completed with validation studies. MCONTRM is capable of calculating dynamic traffic assignment for use in route guidance. Moreover this tool is used within the aid to decision approach to motorway control.  2 approaches to motorway traffic control have been considered, aid to decision and fully automatic control strategies. The aid to decision approach is based on the use of an online traffic simulation model. It is implemented in the form of a knowledge based system and gives to the operator the opportunity to simulate the impact of the planned control actions on the traffic flow. The automatic approach is based on automatic control theory. The applied control law leads automatically to optimal decisions according to predefined criteria (eg queue length, travel time, etc). The first step has been a review of different strategies used or tested for ramp metering both on an isolated and a coordinated level. A number of control strategies have been further improved and assessed in order to be implemented in the field. With concern to motorway network control, 2 entirely new control strategies (one based on automatic control concepts and another using aid to decision and expert system tools) have been developed and tested by simulation means for hypothetical scenaria and for existing motorway networks.  A number of field trials on motorway ramp metering have been designed, executed and evaluated at 2 different sites. These field trials have been extremely useful for various reasons: increasing confidence in the usefulness of ramp metering in general and in the effectiveness of particular control strategies; more insight and understanding could be gained on the functioning of each control strategy and on the similarities and the differences between them; a number of software prototypes have been produced; a number of practical recommendations and generalised experience have been gained.  Twenty subjects were provided with in car route guidance equipment, and then drove between a preselected set of origins and destinations in Athens, both with and without the benefit of the route guidance. Most of the participants had no substantial predisposition for or against route guidance. They expected that it would be useful to them when driving in unfamiliar areas, but not in familiar areas, unless it provided real dynamic information on traffic conditions. Oral information was preferred to visual information, though some participants preferred a combination of both. The research focuses on two points:  - Motorway traffic flow modelling.  Existing models will be improved and adapted to real-life conditions and extended to cover motorway networks.  - Motorway traffic flow management and control.  Two approaches will be investigated - advisory and fully automatic control strategies. Advisory systems allow the operator to simulate some strategies and to choose the `best' according to human experience. Automatic control strategies, based on the theory of optimal control, lead to optimal decisions according to pre-defined criteria (e.g. queue length, travel time etc.).  This theoretical and experimental investigation will include implementation considerations such as alternative measurement and control devices, computer hardware facilities, communication media, system architecture, and man-machine interfaces. Special attention will be paid to system flexibility with respect to the future development of a route guidance facility.  Prototypes both for local and coordinated control will be created. `Real life' experiments for both types of on-ramp metering will be performed at selected sites.  Main Deliverables:  Prototypes for linear & network motorway control; results of simulation study and software specifications.",1,0
154,208862,No,Inside the Mind of Ancient People: the tangible and constructed landscape of the western Delta in the Late Period (664-332BC),"MAP aims to generate an experimental and innovative methodology combining the “sociology of space” critical theory and the archaeological (material and textual) evidence offered by ancient Egyptian society, in order to examine the constitution of space as product of social action or social structures, and recursively to identify the points of contact where the landscape shaped and changed the mind of people. Ancient Egyptian temple libraries preserve a number of written records which provide insights into the religious and geographic knowledge. The challenge is not to harmonize written and archeological sources inside a monadic dimension but to measure the differences, as a way to discover multiple and conflicting stories from the human mind and the actions imposed onto the physical/mental landscape. The “regionally specific sacerdotal” officials during the Late Period (664-332 BC) in the western Delta of Egypt (2nd-7th provinces of Lower Egypt) is adopted as the research-program case-study, on account of its exceptional significance for archaeology, written sources and lack of any substantive previous research programs. MAP represents an innovative theoretical and methodological contribution for understanding the interaction between physical geography and the intimate conception/perception of the physical space inside the geography of ancient Egypt. The goals of MAP will be achieved adopting an intradisciplinary methodology, aimed to reconnect archaeology and philology, through: 1) analysis of the “regionally specific sacerdotal” officials inside written and artifactual sources; 2) landscape archaeology in order to provide a plot map of the physical environment, through which human entities moved and operated; 3) a comparative dimension aimed to generate a theoretical model, which will open new horizons on how humans and the environment interacted, how the environment changed in the mental process and how the mental process was entangled in a tangible geography.",0,0

This framework will help to establish, evaluate and benchmark integrated tourism policies at the local level with a view to maximising the benefits of tourism upon the conservation and enhancement of built heritage diversity and urban quality of life. To accomplish the above goal, the following scientific objectives will be pursued: 1. Evaluate the dynamics of the effects of tourism, at large, upon the social, environmental and economic wealth of European small and medium-sized cities, considering the built heritage diversity and urban quality of life characterising such environments; 2. Identify and benchmark innovative urban governance strategies for sustainable development of cultural tourism within small and medium-sized cities; 3. Provide local governments and decision makers with tools to facilitate the assessment of the impact of tourism in a locality, with particular regard to built heritage issues and relevant quality of life parameters, in order to improve their strategies, plans, and policies; 4.

988,194967,No,Earthquake-resilient self-centering steel frame,"An important requirement of performance-based earthquake engineering is the simultaneous control of structural and non-structural damage. Structural damage measures are related to story drifts, inelastic deformations and residual drifts. Non-structural damage measures are related to story drifts and storey accelerations. Earthquake reconnaissance reports highlight that injuries, fatalities and economical losses related to failure of non-structural components far exceed those related to structural failures. Moreover, explicit consideration of non-structural damage becomes vital in the design of critical facilities such as hospitals carrying acceleration-sensitive medical equipment, which have to remain functional in the aftermath of an earthquake. Structural and non-structural damage results in direct and indirect losses such as repair costs and costly downtime during which the building is repaired and cannot be used or occupied. Therefore, there is an urgent need for minimal-damage structures that can truly achieve seismic resilience.   Researchers have developed self-centering frames with the goal of avoiding residual drifts. Other studies focused on increasing the energy dissipation capacity of structures by adding dampers with the goal of reducing storey drifts and storey accelerations. This project aims to couple, for the first time, self-centring systems and modern seismic energy dissipation systems with the goal of developing a novel earthquake-resilient steel frame. The optimal combined design of the self-centering and energy dissipation mechanisms will lead to a steel frame with superior minimal-damage seismic performance.",0,0
201,97567,No,Nanoengineered Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots for Sensor and Machinery Applications,"'Chemically modified metallic nanoparticles (NPs) or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are central components for the future development of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology. This program aims to introduce new dimensions into the field of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology by synthesizing, characterizing and assembling molecule- or biomolecule-modified nanoparticles (NPs)/Quantum dots (QDs) hybrid nanostructures that perform tailored and programmable functionalities.  The project will include two complementary research activities.  One direction will include the generation of electropolymerized ligand-functionalized Au NPs matrices on electrode surfaces.  By tethering of appropriate ligands to the NPs, imprinted matrices for selective sensing, and signal-triggered NPs 'sponges' for the selective uptake and release of substrates will be designed.  Also, electrochemically induced pH changes by the NPs matrices will be used to control chemical reactivity (e.g., sol-gel transitions, activation of the ATP synthase machinery).  The second research direction will implement ligand-modified QDs for the sensing of ions or molecular substrates.  Similarly, nucleic acid-functionalized QDs will be used to develop new versatile sensing platforms exhibiting multiplexed analysis capabilities.  One platform will include the quenching of the QDs by G-quadruplexes, whereas the second platform will use biochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) as readout signal.  Also, QDs-modified supramolecular DNA nanostructures will be designed to perform programmed machinery functions such as 'bi-pedal walker', 'seesaw', 'gear' or 'tweezers', and the machinery functions will be transduced by the optical properties of the QDs.  Finally, DNA-machines that trigger the isothermal amplified replication of the analyzed nucleic acid will be designed, and QDs tethered to the machine will optically transduce the replication process at real-time.'",0,0
786,13693,No,"GENETIC MANIPULATION OF THE ANAEROBE, ZYMOMONAS MOBILIS FOR FERMENTATION OF WASTE STARCH","ZYMOMONAS BACTERIA COULD OFFER CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVED ALCOHOL FERMENTATION IN COMPARISON WITH YEASTS. AN EFFICIENT EXPRESSION VECTOR IS, HOWEVER, AN ABSOLUTE REQUISITE TO OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ZYMOMONAS. THE BACTERIA COULD THEN BE MADE ABLE TO USE FOR EXAMPLE RENEWABLE CARBON SUBSTRATES ABUNDANT IN AGRICULTURE WASTES.  Zymomonas mobilis is a Gram negative anaerobe producing ethanol 5 to 6 times faster than yeast. It can use only glucose, fructose and sucrose as carbon sources. Therefore, applications of Z mobilis at the industrial level require extention of its spectrum of usable carbohydrates. Genetic improvement was approached through formal genetics and genetic engineering. Chemical mutagenesis, transposon mutagenesis, gene transfer by aided conjugation, construction of recombinant expression vectors and transfer into Z mobilis genes responsible for xylose metabolism were established and can now be applied to increase the substrate range of Z mobilis.  Recombinant plasmids were constructed by subcloning fragments of native Z mobilis plasmids in known vectors. These were transferred into Z mobilis by aided conjugation and were stably inherited, especially after the loss of native plasmids. Subcloned Z mobilis plasmid sequences were used to construct new expression vectors, which could be transferred into Z mobilis and induce expression of the xylose catabolism genes xylA and xylB. However, the engineered strains could not ferment xylose. Transformation of Z mobilis by plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) occurred at low frequencies only when sequences of incoming plasmid were integrated into the host's genome. Transposon mutagenesis was accomplished by conjugal transfer of transposon bearing plasmids from Pseudomonas, as well as Escherichia coli donors to Z mobilis. All Z mobilis strains tested were able to ferment extracts of various fruits, such as apples, oranges, peaches, watermelons, etc. AN EFFICIENT EXPRESSION VECTOR SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED FOR ZYMOMONAS MOBILIS. FOR THIS, THE PROMOTOR OF THE PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE GENE WILL BE ISOLATED, SEQUENCED AND BUILT INTO A BROAD HOST RANGE PLASMID. GENES FOR THE DEGRADATION OF AMYLOSE (FROM ASPERGILLUS AWAMORII) OR XYLOSE (FROM KLEBSIELLA) SHALL BE PLACED UNDER CONTROL OF THIS STRONG PROMOTER AND EXPRESSION WILL BE TESTED IN SUITABLE ESCHERICHIA COLI STRAINS.

234,215388,No,The interaction of environmental conditions and species traits as drivers of species extinctions and community homogenisation,"Climate and habitat change are accelerating the loss of biodiversity at unprecedented rates. To prevent this loss it is critical to understand species extinction patterns globally. Several studies have linked species extinctions with their intrinsic lifehistory and ecological traits. However, the predictive power of the models is weak generating great uncertainty for applied conservation strategies on the ground. An important factor that is often forgotten is that species extinctions are the culmination of a sequence of local population declines or extirpations, each of which may present distinct trait-environment dynamics. There is still little knowledge on how factors related to species traits and those related to the environmental conditions occurring at the population level interact to drive species declines. Neither is well known how these processes scale up to determine community homogenisation. EXTINCT will use citizen-based data of ca. 175 butterfly species collected over >18 years along three countries (UK, South Finland and NE Spain) to test how the species traits and the environmental conditions interact in driving population declines and extirpations, and the consequent community homogenisation. Specifically, EXTINCT will use butterfly intrinsic traits found to be key in the species ecology and representative of wider taxa, and it will test how they interact with the environmental conditions in terms of climate (aridity) and landscape heterogeneity (topography and landcover heterogeneity). EXTINCT covers six out of the ten bioclimatic regions and three main biomes along Europe, ensuring the generalisations of the findings. It will use modern Bayesian Hierarchical models to correct the ecological inferences from the error inherent to data collected by volunteers. With an applied perspective, it will also inform on the level of local landscape heterogeneity (and thus, management) required to preserve the species, which comprise the local community.",0,0
994,44766,No,MULTI FREQUENCY INDUCTION HARDENING PROCESS INDUSTRIALISATION USING HIGH POWER SOURCE TECHNOLOGY,"The BE 'Multifinding' Project that ended in June 97 demonstrated the technical feasibility of double layer induction hardening applied to critical and complex components like gears. Automotive spur and helical gears hardened by using induction pulsed high frequency power sources in a double frequency double layer process exhibit equivalent service life properties as those obtained using case hardening processes.  Target of the present project is to validate the process developed in 'Multifinding' and demonstrate its technical and economical feasibility on large scale. This will be achieved by optimising and improving the several technologies involved: power source and control system redesign, hardening process simulation, inductor design, basic material composition and machinability. For the power source the most promising technology will be selected among those presently available: Electronic Tubes, MOS-FET Transistor, IGBT Transistor. The selected technology will be a new high power source delivering power pulses (> 1000 kW) for short durations (<0.25 sec) with precision and reliability. Extensive work on basic material composition will be carried out in order to improve machinability and in each step of the manufacturing process by working in several directions, notably steel microstructure, hardness, inclusion content and alloying elements to improve machining performance and optimise microstructure before induction heating. Results of this work will be used to test, on a large scale (1000 pieces) and according to industrial certification procedures, representative automotive components in order to validate: - the multi frequency induction process reproducibility in terms of energy precision and quality. - the high power induction source reliability for obtaining constant process parameters in large series and types of components. - the machinability, forgeability and metallurgical performances of an improved machinable steel grade specific for double layer induction treatment. - the consistency of production quality by characterisation of parts for service properties and for high precision. - the compatibility of the new process with new flexible machining systems.  The developed power source will be a pilot machine with the same capabilities in terms of power as an industrial machine. Test results will be used as input for a technical economical analysis. Output data will be used for a comparison between the induction hardening process and current case hardening. Moreover they will supply arguments to end users to take decision for the integration of the Multifrequency hardening process into manufacturing lines of mechanical components taking advantage of just in time production shorter manufacturing steps and lower production cut cost.",0,0
153,226057,No,Law as Vehicle for Social Change: Mainstreaming Non-Extractive Economic Practices,"The current economic model is overdue for revision. The relentless focus on economic growth is ravaging the environment, and the concomitant social problems have either already reached glaring levels (rocketing global inequality) or seem poised to do so (climate displaced persons). A number of radical proposals, such as prosperity without growth, circular economy, or doughnut economics, have been proposed to chart a trajectory towards socio-ecological transformation, arguing that a profound change in our ways of living and modes of production is necessary in order to respond to the threats we face.  Yet such proposals, however commendable, have gained only modest political traction, insofar as they seem unthinkable from the vantage point of our current economic system, consumption patterns, political discourse and legal institutions.  This project will show how law can contribute to making such transformative projects politically credible. More specifically, it will demonstrate how law, and private law in particular, can be used to nurture those existing economic practices that already build on the environmental and social aspirations embodied by such projects. The two main objectives are, first, to offer a set of legal tools and policy proposals that would make the adoption of environmentally and socially non-extractive economic practices, such as social cooperatives or solidary financial institutions, more attractive for people to implement. Second, N-EXTLAW theorizes how law can turn seemingly utopian projects for socio-ecological transformation into a realistic legal-political project. By refashioning the concrete socio-legal arrangements for pursuing non-extractive economic practices as well as re-shaping the values on which economic decision-making draws, law can make non-extractive economic practices more present in everyday action, and thereby uphold those cultural frames that affirm the sense that socio-ecological transformation is within our reach.",0,0

Nevertheless, the different modules of the PLM flow do not communicate each other and existing studios suffer from a non-integrated approach. Going cheaper and faster will require new technical offers and business models.  Platon will solve these issues by bringing a disruptive approach at the international level. It will provide an interoperable single environment to applications which will share the same digital mock-up, allowing easier product analysis and optimization. Customers will be able to target 0 costly prototype and to increase engineers’ productivity. Indeed, Platon will enable users to 1) automate many repetitive design and modelling tasks, 2) evaluate the impact of design changes, 3) deploy best practices to non-experts and 4) partner with design & engineering colleagues more effectively. Phase 1 will investigate identified bottlenecks and allow a deeper market analysis. The results will be delivered in updated business plan, leading the solution to the market with clear, measurable, realistic and achievable objectives.  Optis’ strategy is based on a win-win approach with stronger ROI for the entire ecosystem. Optis is structured with international subsidiaries and has delivered more than 7000 licenses worldwide.

128,69692,No,Role of intercellular adherens junction in the regulation of endothelial cell growth and apoptosis,"Interendothelial adherents junctions play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. Null mutation of the endothelial specific VE-adhering gene leads to impairment of vascular remodelling and endothelial survival, which is in part due to the loss of VEGF function as a survival factor in these instants. As it was shown that VE-adhering forms complexes with the VEGF receptor 2, in this project we will investigate the significance of VE-adhering in regulating VEGF function and which role beta-catena plays in this process. In adulation, since VE-adhering is an important determinant of contact inhibition of cell growth in the endothelium, the signalling processes at the basis of this activity will be studied. In order to address these questions endothelial cells cultured from VE adhering deficient mice will be used as a model for transfixion of various VE-adhering mutants in an endothelial background. Mutant proteins will be designed to alter either the binding or the detachment of beta-catena from VE-adhering. Furthermore the involvernent of the p120^ctn binding site and the significance of the extra cellular domain of VE-adhering will be investigated.

1164,216936,No,Epigenetic Glioblastoma Therapeutics,"The goal of this project is to develop a successful treatment that combats the progression of glioblastoma and improve patients’ quality of life. Glioblastoma, the most malignant brain tumour, leads to disproportionately high morbidity in patients and impacts the economy through high mortality rates. The available treatment options are highly ineffective and pose a significant challenge to the healthcare budgets of all nations.  Beactica aims to address this challenge by developing novel compound to inhibit the overexpressed in cancers protein LSD1. Beactica’s programme is based on a verified LSD1 knockdown technique and proves markedly more effective with glioblastoma clones that are resistant to other therapeutics. This way, Beactica’s compounds effectively clear cancer cells from which brain tumour might grow anew and will reduce the risk of relapses.   This therapy will improve intervention outcomes for patients and lower additional treatment and healthcare costs including longer hospitalisation and further medical procedures. This programme is unique and there are no competitors using the same approach to treat glioblastoma by knockdown of the LSD1 protein with a small molecule.   The ultimate success of this project will depend on the generation of clinical data which will improve opportunities for out-licensing. Beactica plans to apply for SME Phase 2 grant to take the lead compound through the clinical Phase I/IIa, and then reach the pharmaceutical market by an agreement with a strong licence partner. Beactica has an established business development contact network and has already gained trust of external investors in this innovative technology.

818,208347,No,A High-Sensitive Green Localization System for High-Speed Self-Driving Vehicles,"Among the main goals of Intelligent Transportation Systems are (i) safety: reducing threats encountered due to human impact, and (ii) efficiency: providing transportation opportunities in an ecologically and economically sustainable way. Self-driving vehicles (SDV) have the potential to achieve both goals, for which localization (i.e., the determination of the positon and velocity of the vehicle) is of key importance. Localization is challenging due to the variety of conditions (weather, clutter, obstructions) that may impede different sensors, as well as the strict latency requirements. Accurate and fast localization is a necessity for providing crash-safe high-speed SDVs. Furthermore, reducing energy costs introduced by the continuous localization process is required for reducing the frequency to charge an SDV. Current SDV localization technology is insufficient in meeting these three performance measures at the same time, requiring a different approach for high-speed SDVs. This project proposes a high-sensitive fast green relative localization system, called as GREENLOC, which obtains and shares the relative location of surrounding vehicles and road-side units by ultra-wideband cross-layer communications in a multi-hop vehicular ad-hoc network. GREENLOC is the first localization system, which enables crash-safe SDVs driving not only on highways close to speed limits, but also in congested low-speed traffic. Moreover, GREENLOC is the first localization method that works accurately even in difficult weather conditions. This project has the potential to shift Europe forward in the international competitive race of SDVs, making crash-safe high-speed SDVs possible, which in turn has the potential to solve the traffic congestion problem. Besides, this fellowship is an excellent opportunity for the experienced researcher, who is enthusiastic about realizing her idea in an international research environment after a long period of parental leave dedicated to her family.",1,0
259,94635,No,The Molecular Mechanisms of Stem Cell Self Renewal,"Over the past few years, a view has emerged that pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is cell-autonomous and does not depend on external signals. This was based on work that showed that a combination of a small molecule ERK inhibitor with a GSK3 kinase inhibitor was sufficient to maintain self-renewal, in absence of any growth factors. I have now discovered that autocrine or paracrine signalling via the Wnt pathway plays an essential role in ESC self-renewal, and is required to inhibit their differentiation towards primitive ectoderm. Moreover, I have discovered that the combination of Wnt protein with the cytokine LIF is sufficient to support the maintenance and derivation of germ-line competent ES cells in fully defined conditions not containing any other growth factor. Thus, two different fully defined conditions both maintain self-renewal, but do so in different ways. However, the intracellular events downstream of those conditions must both converge on the self-renewal machinery. By analyzing and comparing these events in both systems, unmatched synergy in zooming in on the relevant entrances into the self-renewal machinery can be obtained. I propose to analyze the events downstream of these two sets of self-renewal stimuli, in an effort to identify novel self-renewal genes. The downstream effects of the self-renewal stimuli will be analyzed using gene expression profiling, ChIP-Seq, and phosphoproteomic approaches. Combining and comparing the different data sets will identify candidate genes that will be screened in a self-renewal assay designed for high sensitivity and throughput. Genes that pass this test will be further analyzed for their roles in proliferation, survival, and differentiation in an effort to compartmentalize the self-renewal machinery into functional blocks. This analysis will provide the first comprehensive resource documenting the molecular workings of self-renewal.",0,0
1005,213246,No,A new tool for creating real-time music within computer games,"Computer games are experiencing an incredible fast evolution. With around 2.2 billion gamers across the globe (25% of the European on-line population plays video games) the industry has a constant demand for new technology, essential to maintain players’ interest in a very demanding market. Music, as a crucial part in the computer games creation process, also requires the new videogame era: whereas old computer games were, in general, simple (often just requiring a single melody), current ones are deeply complex, with several plots and levels, and almost infinite potential scenarios. However, current approaches for music composition do not adapt to this non-lineal essence of games but are just based on looping static musical pieces for each game level. This results in repetitive soundtracks, uninteresting for players, and a time-consuming activity for composers, unable to create a soundtrack for every single potential scenario.  Based on the previous success of our CALMUS technology (that facilitates real-time adaptation of music composition to diverse external stimuli), we now present CALMUSgaming. CALMUSgaming is an innovative tool for automatically creating and adapting music within computer games. Instead of the soundscape being perpetually repeated, it enables a constant and real-time adaptation of the background music, according to how game progresses and to the player's performance and actions. On the one hand, CALMUSgaming facilitates music composition for computer games: it automatically generates complex and dynamic themes saving up to 90% of composition time. On the other hand, it enriches players’ experience, as it changes constantly as the game progresses. ErkiTónlist is an Icelandic SME focused on promoting creative endeavours in music. Grown over the achievements of our CALMUS technology, and out of our collaboration with CCP Games (one of the on-line games leaders worldwide) we have now found a great opportunity to enter the computer games industry.",0,0

Identity and Territory Dimension in Anti-planning Movements : A comparative perspective from Turkey,"Urban and environmental planning are increasingly subject of contestation at different scales. In launching these projects, the public actors frequently argue on general interest irreducible to particular interests of a few of inhabitants. If this type of resistance is often discussed in the case of so-called &quot;NIMBYs&quot; (Not in my backyard) to designate opposition of associations and, more broadly, public to planning that may disrupt their environment, identical and territorial dimensions of these contestations is completely ignored in the study of these phenomena. Our objective in this project is to move beyond this debate and look at the nature of these planning that can sometimes become the instrument of a multidimensional policy of discrimination by public institutions against ethnic and political minorities. In Turkey, this phenomena is observable in several planning project and especially in three that we have chosen as our field study : Ilisu Dam and Resettlement Project and local contestation against Kurdish displacement ; transformation and Renovation Project of Sulukule district which plans to destroy entirely the gipsy settlements and finally the fragmentation and Transformation Project on slums of district of May 1 where there is a religious minority (Alevis) who has a strong collective political identity (communisme). In all three case studies, these are the areas of economic and social deprivation populated mainly by an ethnic or political minority namely Kurds, Gypsies and Alevis. Emphasis will be placed on the logics of exclusion in the planning policies and the role of identity and territory in the organisation of contestations against theses plannings. Our goal is to demonstrate that behind the mobilizations organized deal with these adjustments, the collective identity of the community is crucial because the very nature of the organization, the community sees itself under threat (exile, death, loss of the cultural identity and / or political)",0,0
912,217414,No,"A cost effective, self-calibrating, low maintenance pH sensor for an integrated approach to monitoring sea and drinking water, facilitating improvements in ocean, animal and human health","ANB Sensors (ANB) is a company set up to develop the next generation of pH Sensors for oceanographic, source water and aquifer monitoring and water resource management applications. In a short period of time, ANB has won innovation awards and grant funding and registered intellectual property (IP) (3 patents pending with a further 5 patents in the filing stage) covering new, fundamental pH sensor technology. The key failing of existing pH sensors is the short life and high maintenance costs of the sensors, which is a result of reference electrode drift giving unreliable measurements. The impact of reference drift is that most current ISE sensors cannot be used for long duration monitoring, cannot be used autonomously in smart sensor networks and require frequent, labour intensive calibrations. The only solution to reference drift currently available is expensive manual calibration. ANB’s innovative pH sensor, the pHenom, is based on a voltammetric electrochemical technique, which utilises a pH responding molecule bound within a solid-state matrix. This is combined with a novel means of verifying the performance of the pHenom’s reference electrode through an additional in-situ electrochemical measurement. For the first time, the pHenom sensor provides a pH sensor that is capable of smart, networked sensing allowing companies and government funded agencies to use their scarce monitoring management resources more efficiently. ANB’s overall objective for this project, therefore, is to develop the pHenom technology to the point where it can be placed on the market as-soon-as-possible, through technology licensing and sales. To meet this objective, in this project ANB will develop and produce four commercial prototype sensor systems specifically tailored for the biggest pH sensor market, the water monitoring and management industry. These commercial prototypes will be used to demonstrate the operational advantages of the pHenom technology to gain market acceptance.",0,0

1182,199928,No,A knowledge transfer and sharing action for developing A new integrative approach to mitigating errors in hospitals: Resolving tensions in error research,"Errors are a recurring fact of organizational life and the wisdom of managing and learning from errors is incontrovertible. In particular, medical errors in the health care industry, defined as avoidable adverse outcomes or injuries to patients stemming from healthcare processes, pose serious threats to human life and have an impact on total national costs. Yet, healthcare organizations that achieve a breakthrough in mitigating errors are extraordinarily rare. The aim of this Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions proposal is thus to improve our understanding of the occurrence of medical errors and to develop a new, integrative approach to mitigating medical errors and promoting quality, efficiency, and innovativeness in hospitals. We strive for this goal by immersing ourselves in broad literature reviews and going beyond state of the art, collecting massive first-hand data in the hospital settings, and testing our working hypotheses on both qualitative and quantitative data. We envision three direct outcomes of our endeavor that are beneficial to both the academic community and heath care organizations. First, we will suggest an integrative theory of errors in organizations by identifying discrepancies, tensional issues, and opportunities for research synthesis via level of analysis and temporal and priority lenses. Second, we will develop an innovative, hybrid method to illuminate the errors phenomena and assess long-term effects of medical errors. Third, starting with the partnership between three participating research teams, we will create a long-lasting network that offers a rich resource for collaboration and knowledge-sharing that makes this resource more visible, inspectable, and systematic, which may aid the process of learning at a larger societal level.",0,0

Interpretations of Aristotle’s Cosmology Across the Ages” that has received the Seal of Excellence 2019. THEIA is a project on the paraphrase of Aristotle’s De Caelo by the 4th century rhetor and philosopher Themistius. It aims to shed light on Themistius’ presentation of the Aristotelian cosmos, that is contained chiefly in this paraphrase. Its importance in the history of Aristotelianism is beyond doubt, as it is the first complete exegesis of the De Caelo that has come down to us, but adequate study of it has been hampered by the fact that the original Greek is lost: only a medieval Hebrew version of the lost Arabic version, and in a Hebrew-into-Latin version survive. Both are edited, but the Latin is derivative, and the Hebrew text requires a new critical edition. THEIA will edit, translate into English, and comment upon the Hebrew text. Once the task accomplished, this will allow the scholars in the field to get a more complete picture of 4th century Aristotelianism. To the importance of THEIA for the history of philosophy another reason of interest should be added, that concerns the text of Aristotle. The Hebrew version allows the scholar who is conversant with Themistius’ exegetical habits to reconstruct some passages in the Greek original, and to single out the Aristotelian lemmata of the De Caelo interspersed in Themistius’ wording. The retroversion of these lemmata into Greek will provide the philologists with an extremely important piece of documentation: parts of the text of Aristotle’s De Caelo as it was read in the 4th century, i.e. five centuries before the most ancient ms of it. In this sense, THEIA can be considered an interdisciplinary project that, through the reconstruction and interpretation of a Greek work transmitted in Hebrew and Latin, paves the ground to a fruitful cooperation of philosophical and philological skills.",0,0

There are, however, considerable regional differences in the number of traffic deaths. In 2000, 159 Finns and 118 Britons per million motor vehicles were killed in traffic accidents whereas the corresponding figure for Turkey was 536 and for Greece 427.  Despite this vast difference between the Southern and Northern Europe in traffic safety, the reasons behind different accident risk figures have remained mainly unexamined. The objective for the European transport policy is to halve the number of road fatalities by the year 2010. This objective can be achieved only if traffic safety interventions are targeted to regions with high road fatality rates, like Eastern Mediterranean region.  This project is aimed at improving the knowledge and research skills of Eastern Mediterranean traffic researchers by training experienced researchers in Greece and Turkey and sending selected researchers to the leading road safety research institutes in EU. The actions will target following new or under-developed priority areas in traffic safety research in Eastern Mediterranean region: human factors, societal factors in traffic safety, driving abilities of elderly professional drivers, and social psychological models of traffic behaviour.  New research and training in these theory-based research areas will produce practical applications for driver education and licensing, enforcement, driver selection and engineering solutions. This project is a multi-disciplinary project in which traffic safety experts from different fields and countries will be working together.  Core group of researchers from Turkey will be sent to a specialized training period to partner institutes. After returning to host institute, these researchers will work as teachers and group leaders in a traffic safety programme, experimental traffic research laboratory and a driving ability clinic.",1,1

In this context, is clear that the reduction of energy consumption in the residential sector should play an important role in energy efficiency programs and policies. Currently, energy consumers and energy utilities face various barriers that deter them from adopting energy efficiency measures: (i)Energy bills difficult to understand by energy consumers; (ii) low-optimized energy consumptions; (iii) low quality services by energy utilities, resulting in a large number of unsatisfied customers. At Energintel S.L (Asturias, Spain) we have developed a smart solution to overcome these barriers. EnergyMate provides users information about their energy consumptions in a natural language format easily understandable by users, suggesting personalized recommendations, and allowing to adapt their behavior to the hourly energy prices. It has been estimated an annual reduction of 25% in energy consumption and an increase of 30% of the customer´s satisfaction with EnergyMate.

These two pillars are based on the emerging concepts for natural resource management emphasising reuse and recycling. They will be centred on peri-urban water management, but will include organic solid waste management, and agricultural water management. The “restricted biosphere” where VIVACE will test their tools is represented by rapidly developing urban or small town areas in Latin America, together with their rural/natural surroundings. The systems boundaries will be set on a case specific basis in such a way that the mutual impacts of water extraction and wastewater/waste disposal can be assessed.  In each case study, VIVACE will analyse the impact of existing resource management practices (within the considered sectors) on the economic development in the region. This will allow the evaluation of the potential of proposed innovative concepts for safeguarding and or fostering economic development in a restricted biosphere. Integrated analytical approaches for decision support and strategic planning will then be developed and tested, with particular focus on tools for integrated and participatory assessment of these aspects. In this perspective, the two primary objectives of VIVACE will be:  1.

The main goal of this method is to provide nanoscopic scale resolved, topographic artifacts free, order parameter related images of modern complicated materials, including artificial nanostructures. The new experimental tool is expected to keep main advantages of scanning techniques known so far: atomic force microscopy, near-field optical microscopy, and ac field modulation imaging. It will provide European researchers with advanced instrumentation securing leadership in the field of materials science. The proposed new technique is a flexible configuration of independent experimental blocks.  The involved participants have separately tested each of them in previous studies. We estimate scanning near-field optical microscopy to be potentially the most powerful tool to study solid state objects with nanoscopic resolution. We have conceived a set of practical steps to realize this potential. Apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy (ANSOM) is aimed to achieve ultimate spatial resolution. The modulation approach will drastically enhance the amplitude sensitivity to ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratio critical for nanoscopic studies.

681,92636,No,Protein assembly: From the molecular scale to the mesoscale with super-resolution imaging,"Cellular responses to external signals begin at the plasma membrane, where the dynamic assembly of receptors can regulate cellular activity. Membrane-enveloped viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also assemble at the plasma membrane, exploiting mechanisms evolved for cellular trafficking. However, our physical paradigm for how proteins form mesoscale assemblies is far from complete. While the organization and dynamics of membrane proteins are heterogeneous, commonly used fluorescence-based measurements lack information at the molecular scale. In contrast, single molecule measurements limited to looking at only a few molecules in a given cell lack ensemble information. Thus, the study of protein assembly has been limited by a lack of spatially resolved, dynamic information on ensembles of molecules. We will use super-resolution fluorescence imaging techniques combined with live cell imaging and single molecule tracking to determine how the dynamics of protein assembly are coordinated. The long-term goal of my research is to use quantitative fluorescence methods to identify the physical mechanisms for protein transport and organization in cells. The objective of this proposal is to establish quantitative models of protein assembly in two specific biological systems which were selected for the distinct characteristics of their assembly, and their relevance to human health. This will test the central hypothesis that molecular assembly is enhanced by the organization of the plasma membrane in the form of cytoskeletal elements and protein-lipid platforms. This interdisciplinary research will provide an experimental foundation for a statistical description of the cell, whose behaviour is embedded in protein organization and dynamics.",0,0

271,90620,No,Aerodynamic loads estimation at extremes of the flight envelope,"ALEF's objective is to enable the European aeronautical industry to create complete aerodynamic models of their aircraft based on numerical simulation approaches within the respective development processes. I.e. ALEF will kick-off a paradigm shift from greater confidence in experimentally measured loads data to greater confidence in computational results. Beyond the scope of ALEF this paradigm shift will essentially influence the overall aerodynamic development process. The objective has three aspects:  1. Comprehensiveness refers to the ability to predict aerodynamic forces, moments and their derivatives in time for any point of the flight regime. It is addressed by two complementary approaches: A high fidelity CFD based approach serves short-term impact. Long-term improvements are delivered by incorporation of simulation tools of different fidelity. 2. Quality refers to the accuracy and physical correctness of each flow simulation result used for aero data prediction as well as to a high coherence of aero data integrated over the complete flight envelope from tools of varying fidelity. It is improved by considering the impact of physical modelling as well as novel quality control means to achieve a highly coherent data space representation. 3. Efficiency refers to the necessity to compute the entire aero data space within time frames dictated by industrial design processes at given costs. It is tackled by means of surrogate models for both steady and unsteady flows. Also planning techniques for efficient simulation campaigns are addressed. The ultimate scope of using simulation tools in aero data generation is to cover all flight conditions and configurations by means of a numerical toolbox. This would ensure an up-to-date and fast estimation of most recent statuses of aircraft with every data consistent. ALEF will essentially contribute to a 70% wind tunnel testing cost reduction by 2020, which will cut the aerodynamic development effort by about 40%.",0,0
177,79984,No,ASSESSMENT OF LIFE-CYCLE EFFECT OF REPAIRS ON TANKERS,"In recent tanker accidents Erika and Prestige in European waters with catastrophic consequences, structural deficiencies may have largely contributed to the accident. Casualty investigation after the Prestige accident identified the need for better understanding in areas of the detecting of defects and weaknesses during and after survey and after repairs, the reduction of any adverse effects of repairs, current strength requirements for deck opening securing arrangements, etc. This Coordination Action project ALERT is proposed in response to this need. The ALERT project (Assessment of Life-cycle Effect of Repairs on Tankers) will undertake a thorough examination of current R&D practices of European industry in the field of ship repair and to propose improvements to the underlying processes in consultation with industry. The project aims to critically review the current and emerging technologies, identify and prioritise future R&D needs and developments in the areas of ship repair practices (WP1), Condition monitoring of ships (WP2), Structural assessment methodologies (WP3) and Through life management (WP4). Finally, the project will disseminate and exploit the results through publications, seminars and workshops and prepare R&D project proposals (WP5). The proposed ALERT project fits in very well to the objective of Research Domain 4.12 ?Developing technologies to sense and predict natural and infrastructure conditions affecting safety and efficiency of transport operations? on the following grounds: it deals with developing technologies appropriate for ship repair practices and sensing technologies to monitor ships; it promotes ship safety through maintaining structural integrity and efficiency through better monitoring, inspection, maintenance and repair scheduling for tankers.

480,93523,Yes,Collaborative research on flood resilience in urban areas,"Collaborative research on flood resilience in urban areas (CORFU) is an interdisciplinary international project that will look at advanced and novel strategies and provide adequate measures for improved flood management in cities. The differences in urban flooding problems in Asia and in Europe range from levels of economic development, infrastructure age, social systems and decision making processes, to prevailing drainage methods, seasonality of rainfall patterns and climate change trends. Our vision is that this project will use these differences to create synergies that will bring new quality to flood management strategies globally. Through a 4-year collaborative research programme, the latest technological advances will be cross-fertilised with traditional and emerging approaches to living with floods. The overall aim of CORFU is to enable European and Asian institutions to learn from each other through joint investigation, development, implementation and dissemination of strategies that will enable more scientifically sound management of the consequences of urban flooding in the future. Flood impacts in urban areas – potential deaths, damage to infrastructure and health problems and consequent effects on individuals and on communities – and possible responses will be assessed by envisaging different scenarios of relevant drivers: urban development, socio-economic trends and climate changes. The cost-effectiveness of resilience measures and integrative and adaptable flood management plans for these scenarios will be quantified. CORFU is structured in six Work Packages. WP1 will look at drivers that impact on urban flooding. WP2 will enhance methodologies and tools for flood hazard assessment based on urban flood modelling. WP3 will improve, extend and integrate modern methods for flood impact assessment. WP4 will aim to assess and enhance existing flood risk management strategies. WP5 will disseminate the outputs.

1198,100044,No,Investigating Functional Dynamics in Proteins by Novel Multidimensional Optical Spectroscopies in the Ultraviolet,"Proteins perform their biological function following specific sequences of events. During these dynamical paths, highly non-trivial cooperative interactions occur. Ultimately, this is the origin of the emerging collective behavior that makes proteins the most sophisticated existing molecular machines. This complex network of processes covers a wide range of timescales, from few fs to ms, and distances, from atoms to large protein domains. Even the most recent experimental techniques generally provide ns-to-us averaged structural and dynamical information, often in non-physiological conditions. To access simultaneously atomic time and length scales would unveil the elementary conformational steps constituting a functional event and their temporal evolution. I propose to extend emerging multidimensional ultrafast optical spectroscopic techniques to the deep ultraviolet. These techniques are the analogue of multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance methods and are able to provide structural information exploiting electric dipole couplings but with fs temporal resolution. The novel extension to ultraviolet, that I shall implement, will open the possibility to exploit the optical absorption of aromatic amino-acid residues with the great advantage of studying wild type proteins. In this way, all drawbacks due to artificial labeling will be ruled out. I will use this new technique to study dynamic-assisted long range electron transfer in copper proteins and enzyme regulation in hemoglobin. These two proteins of great importance from a biological point of view have been chosen because their functions are a clear manifestation of cooperative phenomena. On a long term prospective this methodology will be a universal tool applicable to any wild type protein containing aromatic amino acids.",0,0

778,26966,No,Tidal and marine currents energy exploitation,"The objective of the project is to assess the possibilities and potential of exploiting tidal and marine currents for power generation in Europe. The results of the project will permit the evaluation of effective development schemes for the exploitation of tidal and marine currents to generate energy and of future large scale application in electric utility systems.  The possibility of exploiting tidal and marine currents for power generation has so far received little attention in Europe. Therefore a general assessment of the resources along the European coasts and an evaluation of the technologies suitable for effective energy extraction may be highly advantageous to the European Community.  Marine currents, which represent a large renewable energy resource, can make a significant contribution to meeting energy demand both in isolated coastal areas or islands and for basic supply by integration in or substitution of energy systems based on conventional resources like oil, gas or coal. The project will cover the following main aspects:  - characterisation of the resources along the European coastline, development of a database with detailed information on tidal currents and identification of the most promising locations;  - technology suitable for exploiting currents, including power extraction and electricity transport technologies, equipment for undersea use, system management and operation;  The project will be conclude with a 'case study' which facilitate validation of the guidelines and design criteria developed to identify cost-effective solutions to extract energy from the marine currents in a usable form. The duration of the project is estimated at 12 months with Companies participating to the project from Italy, Germany, Great Britain and Greece. Strong marine current resources were identified at 106 European locations. It is estimated that these could supply 48 TWh per year to Europe's grid network simply using existing knowledge and conventional technology. This renewable energy source is especially attractive because it can provide large scale electricity production with little noise, pollution and land use, and there is virtually no visual impact. The energy resource is predictable over time so that planned base load power contributions are possible. Although the energy source is diffuse, it is more intense at good sites than other forms of renewables. Capacity factors are better than average, in the 40-60% range. The size of the resource is important for the UK, Greece, France and Italy. Luckily, the areas offshore most likely to produce an adequate amount of electricity are in regions where strengthening the grid could be beneficial. The project is aimed at proposing general guidelines and technological solutions for dealing with situation of exploiting tidal and marine currents (currents associated to tides).  At present no databases exist, with detailed information on tidal currents, comparable to existing databases containing information on other marine environmental data (particularly the wind and wave climate) for some European waters. A general assessment of the resources along the European coasts is therefore of great interest. It will allow to address future initiatives and R&D activities.  An updated assessment of the technologies suitable for an effective energy extraction is worth wile in view of drawing technology from wind generator industry, the offshore industry and other well developed industries. The R&D challenge is how to take advantage from the advanced technologies proposed and supplied by the European industry and to implement them in a new field of activity.  Last but not least a new approach is considered: the exploitation system for tidal energy not based on the water head, but on the kinetic energy of the currents associated to the tides. A new and wider spectrum of opportunities to exploit tidal and marine currents is then open.  This approach will rid tidal energy exploitation from the problem of the ashore reservoir and from the problem of the surface barrage with significant reduction of the environmental impact. Moreover underwater exploitation system for tidal current can be made of standard size, and located in water with modest risk of interference with the surface activities.  The project is subdivided in two main technical parts.  The first part focuses on a general assessment of the potential for current energy exploitation in Europe. Subject of this part is the assessment of the resources along the European coast and the assessment of the technology suitable and cost-effective for the tidal and marine currents energy extraction, including energy converters, mechanical and electrical components, control, electricity transport, equipment marinisation, marine operations and systems operations. It provides guidelines and design criteria to identify effective development scheme and related technologies.   The second part develops a case study based on a significant promising location. Scope of this part is to verify the activities performed in the first phase of the project and to implement the achieved results to a specific case. The Strait of Messina (South of Italy) is promising from an energetic point of view and has been chosen as reference for the case study.   The results of the project may constitute the basis for the development of operative prototypes to be tested in field, to demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency by supplying electric energy to authentic utilities.   The joint involvement of industrial enterprises and governmental energy authorities is fundamental to the success of the project and assures the interest for future exploitation of the results.   An hypothesis is offered by the development of a prototype for the Strait of Messina which is the case study object of the second part of this project.",0,0
401,219475,No,Charging network optimized for Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs),"Due to growing population with growing urbanisation tendency, transportation is a major burden for modern cities. In Europe, using cars (even electric cars) is not the most optimal way of individual travelling in cities, due to busy roads, constant traffic jams, and difficult parking. The spreading of so-called Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) represents one of the best solutions to the current challenges of urban transportation. However, the major obstacle of the spreading of LEVs in European cities is the lack of charging networks, resulting in too short range of the vehicles.

870,104173,No,Development of a handheld antimalarial drug resistance diagnostic device using nanowire technology,"'Malaria is a global health priority that has been targeted for elimination in recent years. Attaining the goals that define elimination of malaria in different countries depends critically on provision of effective antimalarials and further that these antimalarials are used appropriately in individual patients. Drug resistance is a major threat to malaria control and has important global public health implications. Over the past decades the genetic bases for resistance to most of the antimalarial classes currently in use has become defined. For some drugs and combinations, these mutations are the most important predictors of treatment failure. This proposal will innovate new technologies to confirm malaria diagnosis and detect drug resistance in malaria parasites by analysis of mutations in nucleic acids, using nanowire technology, and will result in the development of a simple, rapid and affordable point-of-care handheld diagnostic device. The device will be useful at many levels in malarial control by:  1. Optimising individual treatments for patients 2. Assessing the epidemiology of drug resistance in malaria endemic areas 3. Assessing population impacts of antimalarial interventions  The development programme capitalises on highly original and proprietary advances made by QuantuMDx in the field of point-of-care diagnostics. This is complemented by academic expertise that has made major contributions to the understanding of antimalarial drug resistance mechanisms in laboratory models, as well as parasites obtained directly from patients.

962,100302,No,Scientific & Technological Advancement in Research on Agro-Energy: an integrated approach to renewable energy generation according to sustainability criteria,"The project is aimed at developing the research potential of the University of Foggia (UFG); three parallel strategic pathways are planned: improving the research activities through an interdisciplinary approach (“bonding” by research integration inside UFG); consolidating a critical mass of researchers (“bridging” by recruitment outside UFG); expanding the research network through large and qualified scientific and non-scientific collaborations (“linking” through two-way secondment collaborations and institutional partnerships). Other, equally relevant, complementary actions are included: upgrading the R&D facilities; dissemination and promotional activities; research evaluation. One major strength of the proposal is its unusual, high level of integration between the two major drivers of scientific and technological innovation: “research community” and “local stakeholders”. The world energy economy is currently undergoing a critical period of transformation in technology, governance, social and economic values of energy. A new economics of energy is heralded by national and international negotiations and the assumption that economic growth can be supported largely by fossil fuels is fading rapidly. To face such challenges and exploit new opportunities it is imperative to develop novel, renewable sources of energy, be selected in dependence of cultural, social, economic and environmental conditions of the specific regions. “Agro-energy” is the topic addressed by the project: obtaining renewable energy through productive activities complementary to farming. The project aims at building up a methodology to reconcile energy production with the ecological harmony and the cultural heritage of the most relevant rural areas of Southern Europe. This project strives to work out models of sustainable dispersed bioenergy generation and proximal energy consumption. A passionate debate is raging around agro-energy. Someone maintains the position of fossil energy as more efficient than bioenergy and claims that “producing feedstock for energy rather than food is a crime against humanity”. In contrast, others support the ecological validity of agro-energy production.

1012,215132,No,Metabolic engineering of Ustilago trichophora: an isotope-assisted metabolomics approach for the improvement of malate production from glycerol,"Biodiesel production is usually accompanied by the production of 10% (w/v) glycerol as main low-value by-product, making it not yet economically competitive to petroleum-based processes. Recently, Ustilaginaceae fungi have attracted more attention due to their abilities of using crude glycerol to produce chemicals of industrial interest. Unlike established filamentous fungi, many Ustilaginaceae strains can grow in haploid and unicellular form, which are remarkably advantageous for industrial applications. Of note, U. trichophora was reported to have the highest titre for microbial malate production, even if the yield is still low. If the carbon lost during cultivation is suppressed, U. trichophora will be a novel candidate for industrial malate production and contribute directly to crude glycerol valorisation. However, the metabolic network and its function are not described for any Ustilaginaceae species. Isotope-assisted metabolomics approaches are powerful in exploring the metabolic network operation. By capturing the snapshot or the kinetics of metabolite pools, these approaches can guide metabolic engineering strategies to alter metabolic flux distribution and maximize target compound production. Therefore, this study aims to decipher the structure and dynamics of the metabolic networks of U. trichophora by using isotope-assisted metabolomics approaches. Results obtained in this research will guide ongoing efforts in metabolic engineering to maximize malate production from crude glycerol of U. trichophora. Further contributions will be made beyond the envisaged industrial applications, as the Ustilaginaceae are also investigated in the context of host-pathogen interactions and fundamental cell biology.",0,0

619,51278,Yes,"Eco-efficient urban management and new models of urban governance: the evaluation of l a 21 in european local authorities through """"concerted self assessment""""","Problems to be solved (addressing relevant EU policies) There has been a tendency to assume that Local Agenda 21 (LA21) is an end in itself, rather than a process which assists local communities in moving towards a more sustainable world. Virtually all the research up until now has been concerned with understanding how LA21 works, and how it relates to pre-existing policy structures and to local political systems. In contrast, the LASALA project accepts these findings and now seeks to take knowledge further by identifying and researching new models of urban governance and effective management instruments, processes and practices applied to work towards urban environmental sustainability, and in particular the thrifty use of natural resources. Thus this project contributes fully to the implementation and evolution of the third and fourth aims of the Commission Communication on 'Sustainable Urban Development in the European Union: A Framework for Action', COM 98 (605) final, namely protecting and improving the urban environment towards local and global sustainability, and contributing to good urban governance and local empowerment. The project also contributes to the wider policy of facilitating the LA21 process throughout Europe and is fully in accordance with the wider strategic policy objectives embodied in European environmental policy. Scientific objectives and approach This project aims at generating broadly-based empirical material through recruiting150-250 European local authorities in 32 countries who have signed the Aalborg Charter in 1994 and are engaged in LA21, (i.e. commited to sustainable development planning) and by undertaking in-depth case research on new governance schemes implemented by local governments and management systems/instruments/tools applied for managing the city in an eco-efficient way. The first objective is to conduct a 'tele-guided, concerted Local Agenda 21 self-assessment' by the recruited European local authorities. The second objective is to evaluate LA21 in the participating local authorities with a view to developing new models of urban governance and eco-efficient urban management; this will lead to a European LA21 report. The third objective is to identify and disseminate best practices in urban governance and eco-efficient urban management with a target number of 20 case studies from at least 15 European countries. The fourth objective is to assess the functioning of the method of 'concerted self-assessment' and provide guidelines for its application resulting in a 'Local Agenda 21 Self-Assessment Manual'. The fifth objective is finally to facilitate the exploitation of the project results by information provision and dissemination Expected impacts All conceptions of sustainable development integral to LA21 imply a reduction in the use of non-renewable energy sources, the adoption of less polluting lifestyles and transportation and the introduction of patterns of living which are within the carrying capacity of the global environment. If secured, these approaches will inevitably reduce urban pollution and environmental degradation, with consequent implications for improvements in urban health and global environmental conditions. The concept of 'eco-efficient urban management' is central to this project and will make a significant contribution to the policy processes aimed at preserving and enhancing the environment and minimising the use of natural resources.

262,42062,No,Use of Cork and Other Organic Components in the Manufacturing of Building Materials,"The objective of the project is the use of materials of an organic origin (mainly intermediate prime materials from the cork industry), in the building sector, in both precast elements and those produced in situ.  Specifically, the structural elements in which the behaviour of organic materials has been studied are:  - Precast panels of porous concrete - Precast panels of cork-plaster - Compacted concrete to be carried out in situ - Flat slabs for inverted covers - Acoustic screens for roads. The conclusions reached on the different elements are:  Plaster Cork  - There exists a perfect compatibility between plaster and cork, and a great adherence due to the groovy surface of cork which enables the crystalization of the stucco both outside and inside the element.  - The rest of organic materials tested are incompatible with plaster or stucco due, possibly, to a very important difference in their pH.  - The mechanical trials carried out show a low resistance of the plaster-cork mixture, therefore materials such as polymeric or glass fibres have been incorporated to the element in low proportions, significantly improving the initial values and even surpassing (due to some synergic effect between the cork granulates and the fibres) the values of the plaster-glass fibre composite.  - Weight reductions of up to 50% are obtained with cork from clean branch bornizo and a fine granulometry with added cork percentages of 20% from the stucco weight.  - The acoustic absorption of the material noticeable increases with the introduction of surface geometries designed to the purpose. Thus, the use of truncated cone-shaped or cylindric piercings improves the absorption through energetic dissipation of sound by increasing the specific surface and they act as small resonators at high frequencies. This surface design also facilitates the improvement of aesthetic qualities of the products.  - The low density of the product obtained appears to have more advantages as opposed to competitive products both for its easiness of placement in work site and transport.  - The thermic conductivity of the plaster-cork composite in its different combinations and samples tested, offers values between 0.12 and 0.19W/mK, inferior to those of the competitive products such as perlite plaster. This low thermic conductivity makes it ideal as a material for protection against fire.  ANTI-NOISE SCREEN  The result has been a modular screen manufactured with a composite for a special high performance porous concrete and vegetable components which act as organic dry materials and acoustic interceptors of the aerial noise for medium and high frequencies.  The execution of the screen is simple and is based on the insertion of modules between two 'double-T' shaped frames which have been fixed to a reinforced concrete foundation. Both the frames and the modules have devices to avoid the existence of acoustic leaks through them. This device has been given a solution.  With regard to the absorption of medium and high frequencies and to reverberation of same, the behaviour of the SHPPC is superior to any screen existing in the market.  A second alternative consists of a mortar/cork composite or mortar/branch bornizo or mortar/PR composite, which allows a redesign in the surface geometry of the screen without increasing the weight of same allowing a volumetric arrangement and also the introduction of acoustic absorbing elements which act as big dissipators when increasing the general surface of the screen or as small dissipators when then macroporosity is bigger, and as resonators.  This last solution is the one which has optimized the crossing of different parameters in design, organic material durability and reinforcement, aesthetics of both facings, modulation easiness, absence of acoustic leaks, significant increase of acoustic absorption coefficients...  From the industrial point of view, it allows a significant reduction in cost and manufacturing processes.  From the environmental point of view, it enables the re-use of woods residues such as branch bornizo or pruning remainders.  PRECAST PARTITIONS  The composites used in their manufacturing are mortar/cork or mortar/pruning remainders or mortar/branch bornizo, with the advantages and disadvantages seen in the anti-noise screens.  These materials have permitted to reduce in a significant manner the weight of the original HPPC partitions and cork agglomerate sheets.  There are still some questions to be developed such as the optimum modulation for the partitions, the solution to possible acoustic leaks, surface aesthetics...which were not the object of an in-depth study during the project duration.  SLAB FOR INVERTED COVER  The product obtained equals or even improves the characteristics of the most direct competitors with the addition of a natural product instead of synthetic products.  - The drainage capacity of the system is ensured for the covers of buildings. - A high insulation is obtained against impact noises, improving as the frequency is increased. In fact, insulation coefficients of 32dB have been achieved as opposed to 10dB measured for a cover with blocks of porous concrete according to ISO 717-2. - Given the high thermic insulating capacity of the cork agglomerate, the insulating capacity of a conventional gravel cover is reduced four times. - Durability problems of the product do not exist against adverse climatologic conditions, or against a strong exposure to solar radiation. The main innovation is to obtain an increase in the performance of structural elements manufactured with plaster or concrete by using cork or mixtures or organic components from the environment of cork-oaks.  The method to achieve this is via the joint use of concrete or plaster and cork or mixture but with the smallest possible interaction between them. Thus, each material will be able to develop the properties for which it was designed and not to produce disturbances amongst them. In short, the organic dry components will only fill the pores existing in a conventional porous concrete.  For the characterization of the organic components the variables studies have been the following: - Percentage of organic component with regard to the maximum volume of same in that dosing. - Environmental conditions, especially temperature and humidity. - Type of organic matter.  Other important parameters were the amount of light and the humidity-drying cycles at different temperatures, but these were valued as constant in the trial due to the enormous variability that may exist in the real worksite.  The maximum contents of organic matter used in each dosing was according to the minimum resistance value of the structural element.",0,0

TTI has established its current status with own funding, awards/prizes, subsidies, and profits from IoT/LoRaWAN gateway hardware sales and related consultancy. In order to expand exponentially, TTI will have to assess how to monetize its network and technology position optimally. The goal of this SMEInst proposal is to assess three different business models how to monetize its technology position through to scale up and growth.   Specific objectives in this H2020-SMEINT Phase 1 feasibility study are: - Explore promising business cases for TTI networks.  - Evaluate the required specifications and characteristics of these applications with potential partners, citizens, consumers and/or clients.  - Elaborate on a detailed business plan (D1).",0,0
671,89588,No,Development of ab initio based classical interaction potentials for the study of the structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions and interfaces,"We propose theoretical and computational studies aimed at understanding the role of aqueous solutions and interfaces relevant to atmospheric problems.  In particular, we propose to study the effect of ions, salts and acids on the structural and dynamical properties of the aqueous/vapor interface.  These chemical species have been known to play an important role in various atmospheric processes. Understanding their solvation, propensity and transport at aqueous interfaces is necessary in order to address atmospheric problems resulting from man made chemical processing.  Experimental techniques, such as vibrational spectroscopy, provide only indirect structural information of pure liquids and surface-active solutes in the region of interface. A more direct determination of the interfacial properties can be achieved via molecular simulation.  A caveat in interpreting the results of molecular simulations and comparing them with experiment lies in the accuracy of the representation of the underlying molecular interactions. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, we propose (i) to develop accurate classical models of the intermolecular interactions based on the use of high-level electronic structure calculations (ii) to develop general codes for classical and quantum statistical mechanical simulations and their efficient implementation on parallel computer architectures, (iii) to perform simulations of the structural and dynamical properties of the aqueous/vapor interface with an emphasis on the importance of nuclear quantum effects and (iv) to directly compare our theoretical predictions with experimental (spectroscopic) measurements.",0,0

For the first time, the availability of the entire genome of this bacterium will allow to establish the scientific basis for a rational design of environrnentally friendly genetically modified microbes (EF-GMM). Therefore, taking advantage of this novel information a fundamental aim of this proposal is to develop a large series of genetic and biochemical tools to target the incorporation of renal in stable sites of the host chromosome, in order to enhance the predictability of the ecological behaviour of the strain in polluted soils or bioreactors. Furthermore, these tools in combination with potent in silicon analyses will allow to establish the complete set of genes involved in the degradation ofbiogenic and xenophobic aromatic compounds that constitutes its derivative potential and is the master key to expand the bioremediation capabilities of this strain. The construction of DNA arrays will allow analysing and predicting how the introduction of foreign catabolic genes affects the global pattern of gene expression under different stress conditions.

1142,94816,No,Belgian Researchers’ Initiatives to Heat That NIGHT 2,"'On the 28th of September 2007, four big events will be organised in three Belgian cities in the frame of the European Researchers’ night.  Six partners have joined their forces in a consortium coordinated by the Belgian Federal Science Policy (BELSPO), including four of the biggest Belgian universities and four federal scientific Institutes merged for the occasion in a unique Space Pole.  All partners agreed on a common publicity campaign, a common communication and last but not least; a common theme Save the Planet, putting forward very actual branches of Sciences (Climatology, Geology, Astronomy,...) but leaving space for other disciplines to get connected.  Next to this, freedom has been given to the partners, so the Belgian researchers’ night will be the unique opportunity to see a Fashion show with recycled items, followed by a fantastic concert in Brussels, a “water celebration” show in Louvain-la-Neuve, a pedestrian rally 'Science in the city” in Liège will give the opportunity to the public to see ,among others, men feeding sharks, and for the very first time in Belgium, an astonishing full-dome shows presenting the Planet earth will be shown at the Planetarium (in the 23m-dome of the Planetarium),.  The main message that the organisers intend to communicate is that researchers are people like you and me, and that we need researchers in our daily life, but also we need them to save the planet. After that evening, researchers will be considerated much closer from the audience, having as consequence that research and science can be envisageable for a future career'",0,0
893,108953,No,Simulation based control for Energy Efficiency building operation and maintenance,"Buildings Operational stage represents 80% of building’s life-cycle cost of which 50% is consequence of the energy use. Up to 90% of the buildings’ life cycle carbon emissions occur during their operational phase, mainly as consequence of the HVAC, lighting and appliances’ energy use. Therefore, energy and cost saving strategies addressing this building operation phase will have a major impact in the building life cycle cost. Energy IN TIME (EiT) project goes beyond existing building control techniques, developing an integrated control & operation approach, that will combine state of the art modelling techniques with the development of an innovative simulation-based control technique with the overarching objective of automating the generation of optimal operational plans tailored to the actual building and users requirements. This approach will allow reducing system inefficiencies and contributing to improve building energy efficiency and comfort.  The target for Energy IN TIME solution will be existing non-residential buildings, which present the building typologies that guaranties higher impact and room for improvement due to the variety and quantity of facilities and equipment covered and the operational management model used in them. A control tool will be implemented in the building energy management systems to be automatically and remotely operated. The methodology for the enhancing solution implementation will be defined for existing buildings and for its implementation in new buildings since its initial commissioning. The Energy IN TIME project work plan is divided into nine work packages: WP1: Requirements & System Architecture; WP2: Simulation Reference Model; WP3: Whole building Intelligent Control System.; WP4: Diagnosis & Continuous Commissioning; WP5: Energy Decision Support Tool. ; WP6: System Integration & Pilot-Scale Validation.; WP7: Demonstration to implement the designed and developed systems; WP8: Dissemination & exploitation; WP9 Coordination.",1,0

T. Indica does not occur in europe but is intercepted on wheat imports. It threatens wheat quality, yield and exports. Legislation to protect eu wheat was enforced by the ec in 1997 based on a theoretical pest risk analysis (pra). International debate has questioned the justification for legislation, implying such policies are trade-restrictive. Research will be undertaken to develop a more accurate pra for t. Indica. Modelling & geographical information systems will determine areas at risk; a socio-economic model will determine the risks this & related pathogens pose.

233,108612,No,Effects of emotion and stress on different memory phases,"Where were you when you heard about the terrorist attack on the world trade center? Can you remember receiving your high school diploma, your first kiss? Very likely you are able to remember these emotional events. Emotions have a profound impact on what we learn and keep in mind and thus influence who we are. In particular, emotions affect various stages of memory, i.e. encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and reconsolidation. Stress hormones, i.e. glucocorticoids as well as catecholamines released upon an emotionally arousing experience influence emotion’s effects on all stages of memory formation. The major aim of my research is to characterize the behavioural and neurobiological processes that underlie the effects of emotion and stress on different memory stages. To study this topic, I use human experimentation combining behavioural studies, pharmacological manipulations and neuroimaging techniques. Using these various approaches, I am creating a research framework that integrates the cognitive and affective level with the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.",0,0
509,211645,Yes,Holistic Energy and Architectural Retrofit Toolkit,"HEART is a multifunctional retrofit toolkit within which different subcomponents – ICT, BEMS, HVAC, BIPV and Envelope Technologies – cooperate synergistically to transform an existing building into a Smart Building. Based on a whole-building performance approach, the toolkit is conceived to achieve extremely high levels of energy efficiency in the existing residential building stock, with particular reference to Central and Southern Europe, where climate change and energy transition have boosted electricity consumption peaks both during summer and winter seasons. However, it may be extended equally well to new residential and commercial buildings. The system’s central core consists of a cloud-based computing platform which concentrates managing and operational logic to support decision-making in planning and construction as well as energy performance enhancement and monitoring during operation. The Toolkit provide energy saving, energy fluxes optimization, data exchange, stakeholders’ active involvement and Smart Grid interactivity. Interoperable building technologies and installations are also integrated in the toolkit: envelope solutions (thermal insulation and windows) ensure a reduction of thermal loads, while technical systems (BEMS, BIPV, heat pump, fan-coils, power controller, storage systems) ensure energy efficiency and RES exploitation. All technical systems and building components are structured as a function of their affordability, interactivity, practicality, reduced installation time and non-invasiveness. HEART's contribution to the improvement of the building renovation process can be briefly summarized through its main features: • Retrofit planning and implementation optimization; • Reduction of total energy consumption; • Reinforcement of RES exploitation;  • Rationalization of energy flows inside the building and between building and Smart Grids; • Active involvement of stakeholders; • Support to energy financing.",1,1
1125,193380,No,Multi-source Big Data Fusion Driven Proactivity for Intelligent Mobility,"Transportation sector undergoes a considerable transformation as it enters a new landscape where connectivity is seamless and mobility options and related business models are constantly increasing. Modern transportation systems and services have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility environments and intensive use of transport networks including excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion levels and reduced quality of life. Due to the saturation of most urban networks, innovative solutions to the above problems need to be underpinned by collecting, processing and broadcasting an abundance of data from various sensors, systems and service providers. Furthermore, such novel transport systems have to foresee situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which in turn will deter problems before they even emerge. Our vision is to provide the required interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity in modern transport systems for a proactive and problem-free transportation system. OPTIMUM will establish a largely scalable, distributed architecture for the management and processing of multisource big-data, enabling continuous monitoring of transportation systems needs and proposing proactive decisions and actions in an (semi-) automatic way. OPTIMUM follows a cognitive approach based on the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act loop of the big data supply chain for continuous situational awareness. OPTIMUM's goals will be achieved by incorporating and advancing state of the art in transport and traffic modeling, travel behavior analysis, sentiment analysis, big data processing, predictive analysis and real-time event-based processing, persuasive technologies and proactive recommenders. The proposed solution will be deployed in real-life pilots in order to realise challenging use cases in the domains of proactive improvement of transport systems quality and efficiency, proactive charging for freight transport and Car2X communication integration.",1,0
124,98277,No,The role of rhythmic synaptic plasticity in regulating sleep and behavioral performance,"Alterations in endogenous circadian rhythm and debilitating sleep disorders represent an unsolved medical problem. The circadian clock regulates the sleep/wake cycle and is complemented by homeostatic sleep pressure factors. Surprisingly, why we sleep and how the clock synchronizes rhythmic behavior, remain a mystery. Intriguing hypotheses suggest that the role of sleep is to maintain synaptic homeostasis or to reactivate specific circuits that are important to memory and learning. Also, it is postulated that clock-controlled genes affect behavior through the remodelling of synapses throughout the day and night. Therefore, it is important to isolate and characterize specific circuits that demonstrate rhythmic synaptic plasticity and to understand how they affect behavior in a live vertebrate. In this proposal, the transparent and diurnal zebrafish model will be used to examine patterns of synaptic plasticity and behavior during the day and night. The zebrafish is ideally suited to study sleep and circadian rhythms, and the neuronal networks are largely conserved with mammals. We recently showed, for the first time, circadian and homeostatic sleep control of rhythmic structural synaptic plasticity in zebrafish. The goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize new functional circuits involved in circadian, sleep, and memory regulation. We will use in-vivo imaging techniques to visualize rhythmic synapses during the day and night, and after sleep deprivation in multiple neuronal circuits. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches will be used to understand how specific circuits regulate synaptic plasticity and behavioral performance. These data should provide important evidence for the role of the circadian clock and sleep in regulating synaptic plasticity and behavior. This study is expected to provide a critical framework to understand the function of sleep, and may help in the treatment of sleep disorders.",0,0
500,195640,Yes,New European Mobilities at times of Crisis: Emigration Aspirations and Practices of Young Greek Adults,"With Southern Europe suffering deeply from the financial crisis, a renewed public discussion on emigration from this region has emerged. The European South, which had only recently become a destination for immigration, seems to be experiencing a new major emigration wave. This is especially true for Greece, the country which has been hit hardest by the economic crisis and concomitant austerity measures. Despite public attention on the matter, however, little is known about who is emigrating, what alternative mobility strategies are considered and pursued, or the reasons underling migration decisions. EUMIGRE will provide an answer to these questions by introducing an innovative mixed methods approach. This approach allows identifying and studying a sizeable and diverse group of young adults whose spatial and social trajectories are retrospectively traced to explore the influence of the current crisis on their strategies. In so doing, it will also contribute to migration theory at a period when space-time flexibilizations, processes of neoliberalization, and the economic crisis are changing established modalities of and motivations for migration in ways that render the emigration–immigration country distinction obsolete.",0,1
65,83733,Yes,Reshaping public and private: new housing estates and urban development in post-1989 Berlin and Budapest,"The proposed research project aims to compare the recent expansion of planned private housing developments, loosely modelled on gated communities, in the metropolitan areas of Budapest and Berlin.  The project is organized around three central problems: - The differing extent and imprint of globalization on residential construction through studying the origins and diffusion of design blueprints, and the role of international real estate developers and architects in promoting powerful images and spaces of good living; - The impact of new planned developments on the restructuring of public and private spaces in the city; - The significance of housing construction as a tool of urban development in fostering brownfield regeneration and combating suburbanization;  The project will shed new light on the importance of large-scale housing construction in urban development plans and will critically asses the practices of local planning authorities in dealing with private (and often foreign) real estate developers and in reconciling the needs of new housing construction with the objectives of sustainable urban development.  The analysis will also reveal the increasing differentiation of housing forms in the past fifteen years in post-socialist cities and its impact on the urban fabric. The project will thus contribute to understanding the interaction between the legacies of post-socialism and consequences of globalization while highlighting important variation in the trajectories of post-socialist cities.  The realization of the research project and additional training at the host institute, the Centre for Regional Studies of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, will allow the researcher to extend her hitherto dominantly historical research to the contemporary period, learn about novel research methods in urban development studies while working in a multi-disciplinary research environment, and gain experience in applied social research.",1,1
805,45291,No,ELECTRIC VEHICLE CITY GOODS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS,"The current evolution in the organisation of goods distribution in cities has led to a growing use of heavier and heavier goods vehicles in city centres. The nuisances caused by these vehicle to traffic fluidity and environment are growing and are less accepted. To preserve the living environment in cities without impairing traffic and mobility, the problem of goods distribution can be approach in a dual way : - a more efficient logistic organisation of goods distribution can be reached through the development of central goods distribution centres which may reduce the penetration of the city centre by heavy goods vehicles; - a more environmental form of transport can be found in the electric vehicle, wich is particularly suited for use in urban and suburban areas.  The project will be focused on a number of European cities in different countries. The ELCIDIS consortium may be divided in three groups according to the measures they want to implement : 1. Extension and electrification of existing distribution systems in the cities of Stockholm, Erlangen and Rotterdam; 2. Creation of new distribution centres with electric vehicles on a small scale in the city of Stavanger;  3. creation of a new distribution centres with electric vehicles on a larger scale in the cities of La Louviere, La Rochelle and in the Region Lombardia. The innovation aspect is based on the following points : - the development of a goods distribution network based on the deployment of electric vehicles on selected routes radiating from a central distribution point through the city centre, according to the topography of the city, complementing existing goods transport systems assuring efficient modal change and substituting heavy goods vehicles; - the integration of this network in a planning of city traffic taking into account an optimal use of energy resources and a maximal respect for life quality; - the use of state-of-the-art electric or hybrid-electric drivetrains which allow substantial energy savings and less pollution/noise whilst maintaining operational flexibility. In a first phase, a thorough assessment of the goods transport and distribution scene in the core areas of the concerned cities will be defined.  In a second phase, the deployment of electric vehicle for goods distribution will be assessed : - definition of services, taking into account the particular characteristics of the deliveries and the local environment impact; - definition of the desired vehicle characteristics and the necessary infrastructures; - definition of the implantation of the transport centre or distribution depot; - economical assessment. In a third phase, electric vehicles will be deployed on a number of selected services during an initial test period.",1,0
860,89813,No,Intensive Characterisation of Atmospheric Aerosols in the north-eastern Romania at various Urban Sites,"The presence of aerosols in the atmosphere is still subjected to a great concern of interest for a wide range of geophysical and environmental problems varying from local issues to global scale. The levels of the particulate matter (PM) (coarse, PM10, and fine, PM2.5) have been under scrutiny during the past decade mainly because of their effect on health, climate and the environment. Predicting PM10 and PM2.5 levels and their trends in Europe is still highly uncertain due to the lack of the monitoring data in large European Union (EU) areas, especially in the EU members by 2004. Moreover, for the countries entering the EU in 2007 such data are very scarce. Presently, the north-eastern Romania, the new most eastern site of the EU, is highly deficient in measurements of PM atmospheric burden and information concerning their chemical composition. As studies performed on wet deposition (north-eastern Romania) revealed that its chemical composition is affected by the long-range transport process, important contributions are expected also for the PM fraction but this assumption must be accompanied by direct measurements.  The main goal of the proposed work will be focused on i) performing chemical speciation analysis and identifying major chemical classes in the PM composition at 4 sites in the north-eastern Romania: rural, near-city, urban and kerbsite, ii) identifying the main factors controlling the PM levels in the area, both in the coarse and fine mode, and iii) performing an appropriate source apportionment by estimating the source contribution and determining the chemical composition of each source. To characterise the chemical composition of the PM fraction chromatographic, spectrometric or spectrophotometric techniques will be used. The proposed work is intended to be performed such as to supply for the first time a long-term data-base measurement of PM at one of the most new eastern site of the EU, close to a large urban area in the north-eastern Romania.",0,0

1037,105153,No,New MCMC-Enabled Bayesian Statistical Methods for Complex Data and Computer Models in Astronomy,"This proposal aims to develop a new model-based strategy for statistical problems in astronomy involving complex computer models. It embeds computer models into multilevel models in order to explicitly account for complexities in both astronomical sources and in new high-tech telescopes with the aim illuminating the underlying physical processes. Specific methods will be developed to account for calibration uncertainty in X-ray detectors. This involves emulating a computer model for the calibration product and embedding it into a larger model for the detector and the astronomical source. The result will be a dramatic improvement in the assessed uncertainty in fitted parameters, a reduction in false positives and false negatives, and improved robustness of meta-analyses of populations of sources. Methods will also be developed for fitting stellar evolution models. This involves linking multiple computer models via parametric bridges and embedding them into a statistical likelihood. The increased precision of fitted stellar parameters will enable astronomers to identify stellar subpopulations, to study now hidden aspects of Galactic evolution, and to test and refine the physics underlying the stellar evolution models.  A final set of new models will better link supernova light curve data with cosmological parameters, thus helping to unlock the secrets of the formation and evolution of the Universe. Since model misspecification can have a serious adverse affect on scientific findings, especially with such complex models, a suite of new model checking and selection techniques will be studied.

The overall aim of RAIS is to develop a new point-of-care label-free microarray platform and validate it for quantifying levels of specific Sepsis’ biomarkers. The approach uses a novel interferometric technique ultimately capable of providing very large arrays of tests. Specific objectives and activities include: (i) an optical microarray reader based on a disruptive proprietary design combining interferometric lens-free microscopy and proximity CCD or CMOS image sensing; (ii) a microarray plate, in a proper microfluidic cartridge, consisting of a transparent slide with a novel nano-structured surface geometry to increase the detection sensitivity and covered by specific receptors to capture bio-markers; (iii) their integration in a portable and battery powered label free microarray platform potentially capable of measuring more than 1 million bio-targets simultaneously.

675,213580,No,Valuing and Communicating Multiple Benefits of Energy-Efficiency Measures,"Research suggests that the industrial and service sectors, which account for 40% of final energy consumption in the EU, offer substantial potential for cost-effective energy savings. However, an under-investment in energy-efficiency—an “energy-efficiency gap”—is observed in all countries due to the persistent existence of barriers. One key barrier is that companies do not consider energy use as a contributor to their competitive advantage. As a result, investments in energy efficiency are neglected compared to other investments. On the other hand, many frequently observed multiple benefits (MBs) of energy efficiency– such as improved product quality, higher flexibility, reduced production time, reduced production loss, increased safety, reduced operational, commercial, legal or climate change risks - represent important core business benefits for companies. Thus, MBs enhance both the strategic character and financial attractiveness of energy efficiency projects in companies. M-BENEFITS aims at including the MBs of energy efficiency in investment decisions of companies and thereby substantially increasing the deployment of cost-effective energy saving potentials. It contributes to the work programme by delivering best-practice examples, tools and trainings on the importance of MBs for investment decisions in companies, thereby addressing all relevant decision-makers.  M-BENEFITS will -create a harmonised approach to include the MBs of energy efficiency in investment decisions of companies, -collect data and develop case studies throughout the industrial and service sectors to build-up evidence base and know-how on the importance of MBs for companies,  -develop evaluation, communication and training tools for companies to identify and quantify MBs in energy efficiency projects and to communicate them in energy, operational and strategic terms,  -provide tailor-made ways for trainings inside and outside the company and for communication on MBs to relevant stakeholders.",0,0

Natural attenuation, i. e. leaving remediation to natural processes without applying costly techniques, is based on the observation that there is a decrease in the contaminant concentrations that limits the extent of the contaminant plume. The key disadvantage of natural attenuation is the need to ensure that the contamination does not propagate further. The proposed sensors, placed in the vicinity of the plume may serve as a cost effective and reliable alert network. Possible emerging economic possibilities for waste disposal should strengthen EU industrial competivity. This is of special importance for the EU with its densely populated production sites. Scientific objectives and approach The project aims at monitoring of soil and water for landfill related contamination by an in site monitoring for soil and water by infrared sensing. A portable and rugged system will be developed that will allow sensor elements to be inserted and left in soil locations under the ground for long term monitoring of organic pollutants. The concept of a buried sensor gives the opportunity to continuously monitor organic pollutants without sampling errors. Since it is important to monitor pollutants over a long period of time, the sensor system will be optimised with regard to long-term stability. Expected impacts The IMSIS sensor concept is novel for landfill monitoring, its central objective is to open new possibilities for continuous monitoring and control. For this reasons it is one objective of the project to investigate and evaluate the need of end users with respect to sensor applications. Mid IR spectroscopic measurements are widely used for the analysis of samples placed inside spectrometers. This project is involved in the development and use of IR optical fibres for absorption measurements on remote locations. The development of this remote spectroscopy is on one hand an innovation with respect to real time analytical measurements inside landfills, on the other hand it opens the field of all kind of IR remote sensing applications e.g. in process control or measurements in explosion endangered environments. Within the project, there will be a development of short segments of tapered and flattened fibres that will serve as sensor elements in the sensor head. Tapering of fibres to increase sensitivity is a well-known technique in the UV and visible wavelength range. Tapering of MIR fibres is a completely new and demanding task since IR transmitting materials are difficult to process. A further improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by replacing tapered fibres by planar MIR wave-guides with a thickness of a few µm. Such devices are at present not commercially available and will be taken into consideration.

680,37032,No,Power converters for flywheel energy storage systems,"Objectives   This project addresses the requirement for short term energy storage with rapid charge/discharge cycling, typical of operation with renewable energy systems such as wind and wave. Previous work indicates that flywheel kinetic energy storage is a suitable technology for power smoothing in renewable energy systems, as well as in many industrial and transportation applications. The overall objective is to develop power converters and controllers for flywheel energy storage systems, to a level where they could be incorporated in demonstration renewable energy systems. Two drives will be developed; (i) a power electronic drive, by CEGELEC and (ii) a mechanical continuously variable transmission (CVT) drive, by P.I.V.; together with associated sensors; and controllers developed by University of Leicester and RAL. The drives will be integrated into flywheel energy storage systems and application tested at the RAL Wind Test Site.   Technical Approach   The effort will concentrate on the following main tasks :  1) Definition of the requirements for energy storage systems used for smoothing power fluctuations from renewable energy sources.  2) Development of power converter concepts for use in flywheel energy storage systems. Work on the drives and associated controllers will aim to provide systems with fast, precise torque and frequency control. 3) Prototype units of the two drives will be designed and constructed, and tests will be conducted to identify the key performance parameters. 4) The drives will be integrated with flywheels and electrical machines at the RAL Wind Test Site; (i) the mechanical CVT and controller, with a flywheel and synchronous motor/generator, and (ii) the power electronic drive and controller, with a flywheel and induction motor/generator. 5) The energy storage systems will be tested when operated with a wind turbine in both autonomous and grid connected applications, and the relative benefits of the two drive technologies will be assessed.   Expected Achievements and Exploitation   The outputs of this project will be :  1) development of requirements specifications for power electronic and mechanical CVT drives, for use in flywheel energy storage systems for short-term wind power smoothing  2) development of sensors, ratio and power control techniques for a state-of-the-art 30 kW mechanical CVT, capable of fast response when operating in torque and speed control modes  3) development of an advanced bi-directional 45 kW power electronic drive and controller, capable of fast active and reactive power control 4) integration of the drives into two pilot energy storage systems 5) assessment of the performance of the two energy storage systems 6) development of technology and designs which could be applied by manufacturers to provide power smoothing in renewable energy systems, and energy savings in many industrial and transportation applications",0,0
774,62904,No,The genetic architecture of colour pattern evolution in heliconius butterflies,"Despite the extraordinary diversity of color patterns and their clear adaptive value in butterflies, the central question of the mechanisms underlying color pattern change is still poorly resolved. Traditional genetics suggest the existence of clusters of genes (supergenes) modulated by minor genes, that are not homologous between species and suggest prevalence of the genetic architecture in driving adaptation. Developmental genetics suggests regulatory genes are conserved between very divergent taxa, implying a common and labile genetic basis for pattern evolution. My project proposes ( 1 ) to build a dense AFLP linkage map for the species Heliconius numata, using techniques used in closely related species. H. numata is a colour-polymorphic mimetic butterfly, and crosses indicate single-gene inheritance of colour pattern with simple dominance of multiple alleles, contrary to what is found in other Heliconius species. We will then (2) compare the produced map to those of Heliconius melpomene and H. erato, using a suite of codominant 'anchor' loci, including candidate developmental genes involved in colour pattern formation in other butterflies. This will allow us to study the homologies between the two colour pattern genetic systems, and assess the importance of the genetic architecture in determining adaptive change.",0,0
713,222556,No,Transition with Resilience for Evolutionary Development,"The joint Exchange programme is based on a research proposal finalized at strengthening the regional capabilities in triggering, implementing and managing Transition Management (TM) strategies towards driving “resilience-building” processes. The main aim is to combine Transition with Resilience for Evolutionary Development (TREND) of different territorial contexts. It is expected to produce a novel concept encompassing “resilience-building” processes and Transition Management strategies based on the Evolutionary Economy’s assumptions. The TREND analysis will draft from the preceding MAPS-LED project, which pointed out the territorial dimension of the innovation. As an outcome, three levels of spatial investigation are distinguished within the EU-US broader contexts: I) Internal areas, II) Leading regions, III) Regions in transition. Moreover, the diagnosis will assess the potential drivers of TM strategies including: I) territorial milieu, as successful factor assessed in preceding MAPS-LED and CLUDS projects; ii) resilience, conceived as the ability of systems –people, communities, ecosystems, nations – to generate new ways of operating new systemic relationships; iii) crisis, which hit local defined areas, conceived as opportunities, including: migration flows and economic crisis. Relying on the strong existing CLUDs research network and its International Doctorate URED, the TREND project is expected to add value to the current knowledge about regional economic diversification. By moving forward the MAPS-LED project’s outcomes concerning the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP) and the Knowledge Based Urban Regeneration (KBUR), the TREND will provide the Open Access Toolkit: a web platform accessible by community users, policy makers, investors and financial stakeholders. The Open Access Toolkit will provide a set of indicators regarding 1) context, 2) result, 3) performance as metrics of resilience-building process within TM strategies.",1,0
586,21987,Yes,Advanced Planning and Scheduling Tool for Public Transport,"The SUPERBUS project aims to develop an advanced planning and scheduling tool for public transport fleets (particularly buses). The developments achieved during the project will be evaluated by three demonstrations in different real operating conditions.  The main objectives are to:   - Develop a planning and scheduling tool (PST) for public transport fleets that will incorporate the flexibility the end-user (ie the public transport operator) needs in order to implement evolving requirements while taking account of constraints (including ways to express non-numerical ones).  - Integrate an advanced PTFMCS (public transport management and control system) and the developed PST, so that a feed back from the real world through the control system (the PTFMCS) can be introduced. This capability enables a replanning process to take place, allowing automatic reactions from the system and on-line modifications to the initial assignment of resources (reactive planning).  - Generalise this PST tool in order to make it implementation-independent and give it access to the broadest possible market in competitive conditions. Although it is intended to produce a demonstration at the end of the project on a particular PTFMCS, the integration of the SUPERBUS tool in other existing PTFMCS will be studied in detail.   The technical approach includes the combination of constraint logic programming with advanced optimisation techniques, so that flexibility of use is added to preferment solvers. All the project work (particularly, modelling, design, implementation and demonstration) will be application-oriented.   The main innovations that the SUPERBUS tool will incorporate will be:   - flexibility of use and capacity to deal with multigoal optimisation processes in an integrated way  - integration with a current public transport fleet monitoring and control system (PTFMCS or SAE), so that a reactive planning of the resources available (human and material) is carried out in real time.   The main result of the project will be a set of demonstrations of the SUPERBUS tool that will show to what extent the planned objectives have been achieved.   The exploitation of the results will come through the joint marketing of this tool with ETRA's existing SAE (an advanced PTFMCS) and its marketing as a stand alone tool. The main industrial partners intend to exploit SUPERBUS by enhancing their range of products involving IT applied to public transport (in the case of ETRA), demonstrating the suitability of CLP for this IT application, and testing the corresponding market (in the case of PrologIA).",0,1
338,82426,No,A computer aided engineering approach to smart structures design,"Smart Structures Technology offers tremendous opportunities for improving the performance, quality and environmental impact of products in many industrial sectors. The key challenge is to bring the current fundamental breakthroughs on the level of material s, electronics and control to the level of industrial use in integrated applications. To realize this, the smart systems should not any longer be considered as a product add-on. The material and smart system design process must become part of the complete, integrated, product creation process, requiring the development of an adapted simulation-based Computer Aided Engineering methodology. The objective of this Research Training Network is to develop such modelling framework for designing macro-scale active noise and vibration control applications based on the integration of intelligent, high-performing, material systems. This requires the development of modelling capabilities for the intelligent material systems and sensor/actuator components, for the control systems as well as for their integration in system-level virtual prototyping models, enabling the evaluation of performance as well as reliability and cost aspects. Making this next step in smart systems goes beyond the technological developments. The key requirement is that the various domain specialists on the level of materials, electronics, control systems, design simulation, dynamics, noise, vibration etc, step outside their niche expertise domain and get fully acquainted with the multidisciplinary aspects related to the integration of all these components in industrial applications. Without this, smart structures will remain an academic topic. As such integrated knowledge is at present not available with product and subsystem designers, a multidisciplinary training program is needed and will be developed. A dedicated training course program, a schedule of research exchanges and a well-structured training-through-research program are the basic elements.",0,0
1212,98468,No,Origins of the Vernacular Mode. Regional Identities and European Networks in Late Medieval Europe,"Based on comparative studies and contextualisations of European vernacular religious literatures, this project aims at new insights about the dynamics of regional ( vernacular ) identity formation in the 14th and 15th centuries. The investigation will focus on intellectual elites linked in close, supra-regional networks, who gradually introduced the  vernacular mode  in the dominant theological discourse; at the same time, they increased the symbolical charge of the vernacular languages. The core period studied in the project will be the second half of the 14th century, a period in which new forms of institutionalisation and discursive orientation of  ecclesiastic and lay powers began to take shape, and directions were taken that should prove decisive for further development. At the time, Prague was the political and intellectual centre of the Holy Roman Empire, but its international impact is grossly understudied. The project will therefore mainly deal with the rich and little-known production of Czech religious literature. It sets out to reconstruct the personal networks engaged in the creation, translation and propagation of vernacular religious literature, and in the formation of textual communities and cultural identities at the treshold from Latin to the vernaculars.",0,0
647,101245,Yes,Housing Markets and Welfare State Transformations: How Family Housing Property is Reshaping Welfare Regimes,"'This project investigates how growing reliance on housing markets and family property wealth in meeting welfare and security needs is transforming contemporary welfare states. Home ownership normally constitutes a primary family node for the delivery and exchange of shelter, informal care and asset wealth, reducing household dependency on the state. Different modes of housing thereby influence welfare system development overall. In recent decades, increasing market values enhanced perceptions of housing property as a form of social security. Meanwhile, governments have encouraged home purchase as a means for households to accumulate housing assets, thereby insuring themselves against hardship. Understanding the role of housing tenure transformations in welfare system restructuring or the impact of housing markets on welfare regimes is, however, poorly developed. This study breaks new ground by examining how housing markets and welfare systems interact in different regime contexts. It focuses on welfare outcomes of housing as a private good and how housing sector differences influence both macro-state welfare arrangements and micro-household practices. This will advance understanding of how housing markets assume prominent roles in welfare system pathways and influence social stratification. This study will be realized through three sub-projects carried out in six countries that represent contemporary housing and welfare regimes: England, Germany, Romania, Italy, the Netherlands and Japan. 1) institutional studies and macro statistical comparisons will evaluate how frameworks of social and welfare security shape, and are shaped by, housing systems; 2) qualitative field studies will asses how families in different housing and welfare regimes perceive, use and exchange housing assets to enhance economic security and welfare capacity; 3) analyses of international panel data will address how households are affected by shifting welfare and housing market conditions.'",1,1

644,215998,Yes,Actions demonstrate how Park4SUMP will lead to achieve sustainable transport in urban areas by strategically integrating innovative parking management solutions into SUMP policies.,"Parking management should be an important part of sustainable urban mobility planning (SUMP) but unfortunately, it is one the most underdeveloped segments. Most EU member states lack national level policy and guidance on parking. PARK4SUMP aims to change this, because good parking management has proved to be of utmost importance. It frees the public space, supports local businesses, reduces search travel, generates revenue, increases safety, supports urban planning and can make cities more attractive. The general concept is to take the very best parking management examples, contexts and expertise in Europe, learn and profit from these, and transfer them on a large scale and in the best way possible to new cities . This covers raising awareness and gaining acceptance among relevant stakeholders; building capacity, particularly among cities that have difficulty in picking up such policies; stimulating further innovation; and achieving wide roll-out and transferability. Park4SUMP will work on traffic and travel avoidance; it will support less car dependent lifestyles and put into practise innovations in planning and location policy.  It will also optimise the use of existing infrastructure. Furthermore the modal shift towards more efficient modes like  walking, cycling and public transport will be encouraged. Convincing arguments to incorporate parking management can be given : it has low costs, it pays for itself, it delivers money, it is easy to implement and to modify and it can be done in incremental steps. The main expected impact will be cities with strongly improved parking policies that are creatively used to improve the quality of life and business in cities and develop the cities in a more sustainable way.  Park4SUMP aims to establish parking management as an essential part of SUMPS of its leading, follower and external follower cities.  Park4SUMP will deliver behaviour change whilst generating revenue.",1,1
685,52183,No,Integrated concept for groundwater remediation,"Problems to be solved Groundwater pollution in industrialised sites is a general problem in a variety of European cities. Most of them are located in river basins and use groundwater for water supply from local shallow aquifer systems. Within the last decades changes in land use and ownership have resulted in complex contamination patterns, such as heterogeneous distribution of contaminants, different contaminants and large subsurface areas. Industrial development and the need for groundwater conservation are in acute conflict. Today, large amounts of private and public money are spent to identify and assess point sources of contamination without being able to reliably quantify their impact on the groundwater quality; numerous remediation schemes are operated without an economical evaluation of their long-term performance. Throughout Europe numerous guidelines and directives exist at the national level, focussing on the characterisation and evaluation of individual sites - but none of the approaches is applicable to industrial regions as a whole. The INCORE approach supports the revitalisation of urban industrial land inline with the Aalborg Charter of European Cities and Towns Towards Sustainability. Major impacts deriving from contaminated land are groundwater contamination and restrictions to land use. INCORE emphasises the sustainable use of groundwater resources in line with the key objectives of EU water policy. Scientific objectives and approach INCORE aims at providing a cost-efficient technical-administrative set of tools to optimise investigation, evaluation and management of contaminated groundwater and land in urban industrial areas, considering regional aspects such as complex land-use patterns, land-use specific contamination and the extent of urban industrial areas. This will allow the revitalisation of groundwater resources and soil in these areas. Innovation of current scientific, technical, economic and administrative methodologies will be tackled. INCORE focuses on the development and partial implementation of an new approach to contaminated land assessment and revitalisation in urban industrial areas comprising three cycles: (a) the investigation of groundwater contamination emission at the scale of entire sites, (b) the evaluation of the contamination source zones and (c) the development of emission oriented remediation strategies. The major advantage of the new approach is that the number of sites to be considered is reduced within each cycle. Furthermore cost-effective revitalisation measures could be implemented based on the level of tolerable groundwater emissions. To achieve the projects goals following deliverables have been defined which will deliver the necessary methods/tools for the implementation of the new cyclic approach: Application strategies and recommendations for investigation of contaminated groundwater and land in industrialised urban areas. Methodology for optimal selection, combination and application of innovative remediation technologies. Recommendations to harmonise, improve and accelerate administrative work with respect to PPP-Models in the integral abatement of water pollution from contaminated land, landfills and sediments in Europe. Expected impacts INCORE will develop new technical and administrative tools under real-world conditions to provide an important basis for the development of future EU directives on contaminated land assessment. Economic impact of revitalisation process is expected by providing incentives for new business settlements in traditional 'brownfields' avoiding the settling down in 'green field' areas. The public authorities will be given the chance to solve negative site aspects, improve and regain the quality of life and environment in urban areas by achieving and maintaining regional groundwater at high quality, supporting the sustainable use and conservation of regional groundwater resources, and furthermore sustainable develop their city.",1,0
814,17017,No,SOCRATES 2 kernel project,"SOCRATES (System Of Cellular RAdio for Traffic Efficiency and Safety) was a successful DRIVE 1 project (V1007) which culminated in a small test site in Gothenburg. During the project significant progress was made towards the goal of a pan-European traffic information and communication system, but there remained a need for further development.   SOCRATES-based pilot projects are taking place in Hessen (RHAPIT, V2055), Gothenburg (TANGO - part of CITIES, V2054) and London (TIGER and APPLE, part of LLAMD, V2033). Several other possibilites for SOCRATES implementation throughout Europe are under review.   The overall objective of the SOCRATES projects including the Kernel is to maintain the progress towards a pan-European system.   The ultimate goal is to achieve the pan-European commercially successful implementation of ATT services based on SOCRATES. The Kernel is providing the bridge between existing R & D, the pilot projects and that goal. The specific objectives of the Kernel are:   to coordinate the developments in each of the SOCRATES pilot projects, in order to ensure that developments are convergent rather than divergent;  to provide a centralised structure for contact with standardisation bodies, etc, in keeping with the objective of a pan-European system; and  to act as a centre of competence for SOCRATES coordination and as a 'think tank' for the generation of new ideas and solutions. Progress is being maintained towards the development of a pan European traffic information and communication system. The system of cellular radio for traffic efficiency and safety (SOCRATES) project was further developed to include the kernel. The kernel provides the bridge between existing research and development, the pilot projects and the final goal.  The kernel responds to specific requests from SOCRATES pilots, and will issue recommendations to pilots in order to achieve convergence. It is organized into 5 main work areas: liaison and coordination; implementation and operational aspects; standardization; development aspects; and DRIVE normalized transmission (DNT) coordination.  The concept of the kernel as a centre of excellence has been successfully demonstrated in a number of technical developments. These include the following: the development of a common approach to system design in the pilot projects; the implementation of common communication protocols; SOCRATES application centre development; floating cardata handling techniques; communications modelling; development of application protocols; innovative work on dynamic route planning; man machine interface activities; progress on the coordination of DNT implementation.  The role of the kernel in providing a level of coordination between the 3 SOCRATES pilot projects has been demonstrated to be essential and provides the path to full commercial implementation. Technical approach   The common areas of activity in the kernel are:   continuing, but low-level, development of traffic management strategies and software for general use in SOCRATES control centres;  establishment of general SOCRATES system architecture;  establishment of SOCRATES communications protocols;  establishment of in-vehicle standards for SOCRATES equipment;  coordination of data collection techniques;  development of a coordinated approach to a common man-machine interface (MMI) for SOCRATES (when sufficient resources are available);  coordination of the further development and implementation of the DNT (DRIVE Normalised Transmission) concept for ATT communications;  liaison with pilot projects;  overall coordination of SOCRATES developments;  liaison with PTTs and network operators over the commercial establishment of SOCRATES services; and  representation of SOCRATES in Brussels and elsewhere.   The Kernel responds to specific requests from SOCRATES pilots, and will issue recommendations to pilots in order to achieve convergence.   The Kernel is organised into five main work areas:   liaison and coordination;  implementation and operational aspects;  standardisation;  development aspects; and  DNT coordination.   Development aspects in turn is divided into the following areas:   system design;  SOCRATES application centre development;  data collection;  communications;  in-vehicle equipment;  Man-Machine Interface; and  evaluation.   Key Issues   the communications technology for the Integrated Road Transport Environment (IRTE);  development and implementation of a pan-European traffic information and communication system;  development and implementation of compatible interactive route guidance systems;  development and implementation of SOCRATES-based traffic control and information centres;  standardisation of communication requirements for the IRTE.   Expected achievements   It is expected that the achievements of the SOCRATES Kernel will fall into two groups: the first group concerns the implementation of the SOCRATES pilot projects, for which the Kernel will provide overall coordination, so that compatibiilty between the three pilot projects is maintained as far as is practical; the second concerns the future implementation of commercial SOCRATES systems, for which the Kernel will provide a technical, operational and commercial framework on which to base viable commercial SOCRATES services.   Expected Impact   The basis of all the coordinated SOCRATES developments is that SOCRATES will provide the structure for a genuinely integrated road transport environment, in which all the main ATT applications can share the same communications infrastructure.   SOCRATES is particularly concerned with the pan-European digital cellular radio system, GSM, which could offer the fastest path to genuinely compatible ATT implementations throughout Europe. Other potential communication bearer services are however under consideration and investigation in pilot projects, using a coordinated approach in order to maintain as much compatibility as possible.   Coordinated development of SOCRATES concepts will have a significant impact on progress towards the implementation of the IRTE.   Contribution to Standardisation   During DRIVE 1 SOCRATES played an important part in liaison with the various GSM committees; this role will continue during DRIVE 2 in order to ensure that ATT requirements are fully taken into account during the next phases of GSM.   The Kernel specifically includes the further development and implementation of the DNT concept; this was developed during DRIVE 1 and should form the basis of a coordinated approach to integrated communications protocols for all applications within the IRTE.   The kernel is intended, when resources allow, to make a significant contribution to the development of standards for MMI.",0,0
552,194601,Yes,Energy Game for Awareness of energy efficiency in social housing communities,"The main objective of the EnerGAware project is to achieve a 15-30% energy consumption and emissions reduction in a social housing pilot and increase the social tenants’ understanding and engagement in energy efficiency.   The EnerGAware project will develop and test, in publically owned social housing, a serious game that will be linked to the actual energy consumption (smart meter data) of the game user’s home and embedded in social media and networking tools. The solution fits within all three ICT areas suggested in the topic EE-11 scope: gaming, social networking and personalised data driven applications.   The EnerGAware solution will provide an innovative IT ecosystem in which users can design their own virtual home and Avatar and learn about the potential energy savings from installing energy-efficiency measures and changing user behaviour, whilst maintaining the comfort of their Avatar. The user will need to learn to balance the energy consumption, comfort and financial cost of their actions. Energy savings achieved both virtually in the game, calculated by building performance simulation, and in reality, in the users’ actual homes, measured through smart meter data, will enable progression in the serious game. The social media features will provide users a platform to share data of their achievements, compete with each other, give energy advice, as well as, join together to form virtual energy communities.  The EnerGAware solution will be developed and deployed with the ‘cleanweb’ philosophy in mind: “Capital light, Quick to market and Quick to scale”, therefore the EnerGAware project will aim to go beyond just testing in a social housing pilot, but will seek commercial exploitation of the solution at the end of the project, through our industrial partners, in particular EDF Energy, a global energy provider, with 38 million European energy customers.",1,1

On completion of the PReDicT project, the P1vital PReDicT Test will be ready for market launch. Depression is a common, serious and in some cases life‐threatening condition, affecting around 350 million people in the world and 11% of EU citizens suffer from depression at some point in their life. It takes 4-6 weeks after starting antidepressant treatment before a physician can detect whether the treatment is working, the majority of patients with depression do not respond to the first treatment they are prescribed and it can take several months before an effective treatment is identified. During this time a patients’ ability to work and function socially is severely impaired, and they can spend many weeks or months absent from work placing a substantial burden on the economy and healthcare resources. The P1vital PReDicT Test addresses this problem by identifying within 1 week of starting treatment whether an antidepressant is working or not which can significantly reduce the time required to identify an effective treatment.  Patients benefit from this by returning to good mental health sooner. The aggregated economic cost of depression in the EU is €92 billion, amounting to 1% of the total European gross domestic product.  It is estimated that the P1vital PReDicT Test has the potential to reduce these healthcare and economic costs by more than 10%. Thus the PReDicT project focuses on a patient-centric, enabling technology that not only improves efficiency and outcomes for patients but also significantly reduces socio-economic costs.",0,0

The first step to enhance resilience is associated to the improvement in understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climatic and environmental changes and natural hazards on historic sites and buildings, by linking concepts commonly used in disaster risk management and climate change adaptation with cultural heritage management, in order to provide inclusive and informed decision-making. Comprehensive disaster risk management plans need to be drawn up, based on the specific characteristics of cultural heritage and the nature of the hazards within a regional context, taking into account the diverse heritage typologies as well as the specific socioeconomic conditions, since this directly affect the vulnerability of such systems. By a deep understanding of the hazard, the exposure and the vulnerability of the historic area, the local dynamics and the provision of innovative governance and community based models, it is possible to provide useful methodologies, tools and strategies to enhance resilience and secure sustainable reconstruction. Due to the information complexity and the diverse data sources, SHELTER framework will be implemented in multiscale and multisource data driven platform, able to provide the necessary information for planning and adaptive governance. All the developments of the project will be validated in 5 open-labs, representative of main climatic and environmental challenges in Europe and different heritage’s typologies.",1,1

172,100310,No,Quantum Bits in Carbon Nanostructures,"Quantum computation (QC) is expected to improve the efficiency of certain computational tasks. QC schemes are formulated in terms of operations on quantum bits (qubits), whose values are superpositions of two quantum states. A natural candidate for the physical implementation of a qubit is the spin of an electron. In fact, breakthrough experiments recently demonstrated the ability to initialize, manipulate, couple and read out spin-based qubits using electrons confined in a solid state environment. New perspectives have been opened in solid-state QC by recent proposals exploiting the peculiar characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs): utilizing electronic states circulating around the CNT circumference in qubit implementation is promising for various reasons. To evaluate the potential in these novel qubit realizations, we plan to develop a profound theoretical understanding of the physical mechanisms allowing initialization and readout of the qubit, causing two-qubit interactions, as well as those leading to the loss of information encoded in the qubit. We expect that our results will enable the design of carbon nanostructures optimized for QC,  provide understanding of related recent and future experiments, and highlight fundamental new quantum-physical phenomena on the nanoscale.  The completion of the project requires tools of condensed matter theory (tight-binding and envelope-function models, theories of hyperfine, spin-orbit, exchange and electron-phonon interactions), and the theory of non-equilibrium quantum systems (quantum master equation).  The EU contribution would enable the applicant to establish himself in Hungary after his mobility period, contribute significantly to the scientific success of his research career, improve considerably the prospects of his permanent integration, allow the transfer of knowledge he has acquired abroad, and enable him to maintain co-operation with the scientific and industrial environment of the countries he visited.",0,0

25,48321,Yes,Extending the Quality of Public Transport,"The objective of the Extending the Quality of Public Transport (EQUIP) project was to develop a toolbox in the form of a Handbook for the self-assessment of internal quality performance by local passenger transport operators and to ensure, by means of awareness raising activities and liaison activities, that potential users are aware of its existence. The major, and most tangible, output of EQUIP has been a Handbook for the self-assessment of internal quality performance by land-based local public transport operators.  This Handbook has dealt with all aspects of the service as provided by the public transport operator as well as relevant aspects of transport system operation.  It has used the main indicators developed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)1 as the starting point and covers all modes of local surface-based public transport (bus, trolley bus, tram/light rail, Metro and local heavy rail).  In this way EQUIP has provided an in-depth and mode based analysis (the 'vertical' dimension) in contrast to the 1998/99 Pilot benchmarking of local transport systems which worked at an urban transport systems level (the 'horizontal' dimension).  Whilst the principal focus of the EQUIP project has been on the internal performance of the local public transport operator it must be remembered that service provision, or supply, will naturally be influenced by what is demanded by the consumer.  For local public transport there are two groups of consumers: the first group is the travelling public and the second is the procurers of local public transport on behalf of the travelling public (in most cases this is the local authority).  As a result, EQUIP has investigated which supply related indicators are relevant.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Two key activities took place during the first 12 months of the project (1/1/99 to 31/12/99): the development of benchmarking indicators and the creation of the EQUIP Network to be used for piloting the EQUIP Handbook for self-assessment of performance.  Deliverable D2, Awareness Raising, Publicity and Dissemination Plans, established an Implementation Plan, which gave a set of actions to be completed during the last 12 months of the project (1/7/99 to 30/9/00).  Section 5. Of this report for details these dissemination and exploitation activities.  In order to establish the EQUIP Network an EQUIP fact sheet was distributed to a list of contacts generated by the Consortium.  All the resulting Network members (99 by the end of the project) signed a Confidentiality Agreement and completed a company profile form.  The nature of existing information in other projects and sources involved in benchmarking quality in local public transport was established in Deliverable D3, State-of-the-Art in Benchmarking of Quality in Public Transport.  This information also covered non-transport sources of quality benchmarking literature and activities in order to take account of the widespread experience of benchmarking that exists in other sectors. Initially, over 400 indicators were identified.  This was reduced to a manageable set of 111 indicators for Deliverable D3, and for presentation to the operators at the first round of workshops held for the EQUIP Network.  These workshops, attended by most members of the Network, were conducted in the Consortium member countries during the autumn of 1999.  The draft Handbook was developed during late 1999. It utilised the quality indicators and methodologies identified in Deliverable D3 and the output from the first round of EQUIP Network workshops.  The draft Handbook consisted of two parts, which included all that was necessary for self-assessment to take place.  Part I, Method, described the methodology of benchmarking and particularly addressed sampling issues.  Part II, The Indicators, was a book of spreadsheets containing a set of 81 indicators in 12 clusters that measured the internal performance and service quality of the local transport operator.  A Guide to Completion of the Handbook accompanied Part II; it contained a practical guide to measuring the indicators, so that the final content of the Handbook met the requirements of operators.  The Guide was bound separately, in order to be easily referred to when completing the indicators.  During the last 6 months of the project (1/1/00 to 30/6/00) the draft Handbook was translated for use with the non-English speaking Network.  This was distributed to the EQUIP Network for piloting.  Feedback Forms for the operators completing the draft Handbook and authorities providing expert opinions were completed and returned to the Consortium prior to a second round of national EQUIP Network workshops held in the spring of 2000.  The draft Handbook was refined during late spring 2000, leading to the final Handbook, which broadly followed the same format as the draft version.  In Part II, The Indicators, the number of indicators was increased to 91 as a result of recommendations from the EQUIP Network.  The definitions of some indicators were also revised.  Section 4. Of this report describes the Handbook.  The final Handbook and a description of the processes involved in its development were submitted in Deliverable D4, The Benchmarking Handbook, which was completed in the summer of 2000.  In accordance with Deliverable D2, concurrent dissemination activities included the development of the Website and continued targeting of conferences and external publications.  In particular, a newsletter was distributed to an updated list of contacts in order to inform the audience of progress in the EQUIP project and to issue an invitation to an International Workshop in Vienna at which the Handbook was presented (see Section 5. of this report).  Other outputs from EQUIP relate to specific activities.  R4.01, Report on Database of Benchmarking Results, details three datasets that have been generated by EQUIP (the literature review, the benchmarking indicators and the resulting database generated by self-assessment).  R4.02, Review of the Awareness Raising and other External Activities, demonstrates the fulfilment of dissemination and exploitation activities throughout the course of the project.  The final required output from the EQUIP project is Deliverable D5, The Final Report, which summarises the objectives, processes, outputs and recommendations from EQUIP.  An additional report not required by the Technical Annex is the Recommendations and Conclusions, which was developed in response to the need to identify a clear and desirable path for the institutionalisation and evolution of benchmarking local public transport by national associations such as public transport associations and chambers of commerce.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:  The foundations for the EQUIP methodology are based upon the role of the Continuous Improvement Process2 - the search for business best practice leading to an improvement in performance.  Benchmarking is a cyclical process that has three identifiable levels.  At Level 1 internal benchmarking is carried out by repeating measurements regularly and making internal comparisons.  Level 2 compares the indicator measurements with a centralised database giving an external standard to aim for, whilst Level 3 goes on to direct interaction with other businesses who are benchmarking - this is full benchmarking and provides maximum benefits.  The scope of EQUIP was to enable operators to achieve Level 1, but the project has developed so that data comparisons between users are possible using an anonymous, centralised database and that output is a basis for full benchmarking.  The EQUIP Handbook has two parts.  Part I, Method, describes the rationale for the Handbook, how it can be used for improvement and addresses sampling issues - measurement methodologies, data sources and sample size.  The Guide to Completion of the Handbook (Part II) is a separate document which clarifies sampling issues and describes the process of completing the Handbook, including worked examples of indicators and the methodology for calculating weighted averages for the opinion surveys.  A questionnaire proforma for the opinion surveys is supplied.  The 91 indicators in Part II, The Indicators, are collated in 11 clusters of similar indicators covering all five modes3. The first two clusters, Company Profile and External Influences on the Operator, enable the user to position itself in relation to others, when comparing data. The remaining clusters are either straightforward measures of performance or elicit opinions about performance.  The Handbook provides EQUIP system definitions to be adhered to by the user and comprehensive definitions for the indicators enable - and emphasise - the collection of compatible data, making the Handbook suitable for internal, national and international benchmarking.  The identification of elements of indicators used more than once in the Handbook reduces the workload and minimises errors for the user.  The colour-coded format of the indicators is an additional aid to completion.  Interpretation of data is assisted by the user specifying the date to which the data refers and the measurement and sampling methods employed from the methods recommended for each indicator.  This information provides a powerful tool for making on going internal comparisons, as well as explaining unusual differences between companies.  A commentary is added to each indicator, which contains cross-references to other relevant indicators and suggests how the indicator could be looked at in greater depth.  In order to maximise the speed of self-assessment, separate compatible versions of the Handbook are available in electronic and paper versions for each mode.  All quantitative indicators in the electronic version are calculated automatically, including the weighted averages for passenger and employee opinion questionnaires.  Feedback concerning the lack of resources to carry out benchmarking within companies led to the key development of a set of 27 'super indicators' which provide an entry level to benchmarking.  Whilst the EQUIP Handbook supplies the foundations for the achievement of best practice and improved competitiveness in local public transport, it is designed to identify where performance could be improved - the actual improvements will only take place in a fully supported environment.  COLLABORATION SOUGHT  Collaboration was sought in three main areas: the providers and procurers of the public transport industry, national and international associations representing the industry.  The EQUIP project established the EQUIP Network so as to allow direct contact, input and feedback from the passenger transport industry.  This was primarily designed to assist in the process of developing and validating the indicator set and the benchmarking Handbook.  In the first instance there were 13 operators and 4 users (authorities, procurers of transport) from 7 countries.  This number expanded substantially when the EQUIP national workshops were organised in autumn 1999.  At the end of the project the Network consisted of 45 transport operators and 54 users from 9 countries.  As well as the primary function of industry participation in the development of the benchmarking Handbook, the Network provided a key awareness raising and dissemination opportunity, particularly as the Network included operators from leading European cities (Rome, Vienna, Rotterdam, Newcastle).  Most European countries have national transport operator associations.  The EQUIP project believed that these associations had a very high potential to assist in reaching the large number of European passenger transport operators.  They have the mechanisms already in place for dissemination, consensus forming, collective action within the industry, organising meetings and workshops, and implementing training and support for new procedures and methods, including best practice.  Furthermore, they have a substantial membership base covering most operators within their country and the respect and trust of the collective of national and local operators (who may be strong competitors of each other and not willing to participate in any other collective action).  Lastly, many of their members do not participate in any other association and do not have any other significant channel to external developments and advances in the transport sector.  The UITP is a long-established international organisation based in Brussels and is the most representative worldwide body dealing with public passenger transport.  The UITP has a strong interest in the improvement of the passenger transport sector, promotion of best practice, and stimulating interaction and exchange of experience within the industry.  It also has an extensive dissemination structure, database, bi-monthly publication, and regular conferences.  It was considered that collaboration with the UITP offered the potential to reach a very substantial audience.  Furthermore, since the UITP holds a strong position within the industry, then the audience would be more likely to examine EQUIP materials seriously if the UITP promoted or disseminated them (after that, of course, they are accepted or not on their own merits).  Finally, the UITP offered the potential of a stable continuity mechanism for the EQUIP tools beyond the lifetime of the current project.  EQUIP attempted to build up contact with the UITP.  A meeting was held to present the EQUIP materials and to identify potential future directions for benchmarking.  Whilst discussions took place, the organisational structure of the UITP and differences in the timescale between the EQUIP project and the UITP Commissions militated against formal progression during the timescale of EQUIP.  This lack of mobilisation by industry leaders led to a revision of the way forward, which is discussed in the next section.  EXPLOITATION AND DISSEMINATION PLANS:  Deliverable D2, Awareness Raising, Publicity and Dissemination Plans, published in June 1999, prescribed activities which were required in order to ensure that the parallel work within the project - developing the benchmarking Handbook - would be of the highest quality, and so that the future development of benchmarking for public transport would be built upon sound foundations.  The execution of the Implementation Plan outlined in Deliverable D2 was validated in one of the final publications of the EQUIP project, the Dissemination and Exploitation Report.  Five main audiences were prioritised by the EQUIP project: operators, transport associations, transport service procuring agencies, projects within the CEC research programme and implementation programmes. A range of external channels were used to achieve this contact.  The EQUIP Website (http://www.europrojects.ie/equip) developed from establishing a presence in the early stages, when it contained project information, a primer on benchmarking, reference materials, links to related projects and activities, overviews of other projects and the project brochure.  Informative material was added later, such as the EQUIP methodology, case studies, early findings, deliverables, and performance indicators.  In the latter stages, the EQUIP Handbook was added together with later deliverables.  A brochure and newsletter concerning the EQUIP project were sent to a targeted contact list of more than 1400 operators, authorities and interests groups throughout the European Union.  The newsletter not only outlined the objectives and progress of the report, but also informed the audience of the EQUIP International Workshop held in Vienna (June 2000).  This workshop was designed to present the EQUIP Handbook and issues relating to its development and to discuss the way forward in institutionalising benchmarking for local public transport.  37 people attended the workshop from the EU and Accession countries.  20 conferences and presentations were attended/made and seven publications were targeted.  Direct channels were developed in order to provide direct input into the project.  The EQUIP Network (see Section 4.) was composed of 99 members, gave feedback on indicators and methodology and also became a means of dissemination in its own right.  Contact with the International Union of Public Transport (UITP) was regarded as a means of ensuring continuity and the institutionalisation of benchmarking in the public transport sector.  The EQUIP project produced fourteen identifiable products that are available for exploitation.  The major products - the EQUIP Handbook, training tools, the methodology and the database - were categorised in a register in order to assist with their exploitation.  Eight possible exploitation scenarios were identified, including the material being unused, given away, or exploited by the Consortium or another organisation, with or without the agreement of all interested parties.  The preferred outcome for the EQUIP Consortium was that a trusted party within the industry sector acts as the holder of the agreements and data, and promotes the concepts.  The EQUIP partners could then exploit the outputs both collectively by collaboration with the trusted party, and individually at local level.  Lastly, it is essential that the means to continue the research dimension be found, developing the later stages of the Continuous Improvement Model.  The institutionalisation of benchmarking is seen as the key to progression.  Five possible routes can be used to achieve this.  The EQUIP project recommends that the most desirable method is for national associations to take the lead by developing a benchmarking network.  This requires the support of an international organisation, such as the EC, in order to retain the benefits of the EQUIP Handbook, which is currently compatible for international benchmarking.  In conclusion, the EQUIP Project recommends that:  * The National Associations are brought together to discuss the harmonisation of benchmarking activities.  As a trans-national entry point, the 'super indicator' set developed in EQUIP could be implemented. * Operators could be encouraged to develop their datasets with training and support provided by the National Associations, thus recognising that true added value is only realised by achieving real improvements. * As a matter of urgency, the CEC is urged to fund a Workshop of National Associations.  This is a short term response to ensure the impetus created by EQUIP is not lost but does not negate the need for longer term planning to address the issues in this document and in other EQUIP Deliverables.  1 CEN recommendations on Public Transport Quality. 2 Hanman, S (1997) Benchmarking your firm's performance with best practice. International Journal of Logistics Management, Volume 8(2), pp1-8. 3 Bus, trolley bus, tram/light rail, Metro and local heavy rail. The EQUIP project has focused primarily on the provision of local public transport.  The concepts and principles are likely to be equally applicable to the provision of planned or procured inter-urban services as well as in the wider total passenger transport system although the reference values are likely to be different.  Achievement of higher quality and consistency in passenger transport requires the operator to implement systems of continuous improvement based on measuring performance, setting targets, developing strategies and implementation plans, and monitoring their implementation.  The use of benchmarking is an invaluable tool to guide operators towards achievable high-quality objectives.",1,1
1016,211033,No,Novel viral therapy through targeting DNA repair,"Natural epidemics and outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are a growing problem internationally. RNA viruses remain under constant attention due to the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak with potential causal relationship with microcephaly of newly born babies and Ebola virus (EBOV) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causing life threatening hemorrhagic fever, demonstrating how zoonotic viruses pose a major global health concern. There is an ongoing need to discover novel therapies to battle these pathogenic viruses given that no specific therapy exists. Developing new antiviral treatments by targeting host cell proteins needed in the viral life cycle is an emerging strategy to improve therapeutic power and reduce acquired drug resistance.   Based on the results from the ERC grant Genetic Networks as a tool for anti-Cancer Drug Development (GENECADD), we have developed potent inhibitors to DNA repair proteins that disturbs repair of oxidative DNA lesions. To our surprise, we observed, in collaboration with Public Health Agency of Sweden, that these inhibitors potently prevent ZIKV, EBOV and CCHFV viral replication in human cells, suggesting that these inhibitors may be used as antiviral therapeutics. Further investigation into the possible mechanism of action revealed that our inhibitors prevented the repair of oxidative damage to RNA.   Here, the overall aim is to (1) further develop and optimize our inhibitors as a novel antiviral target and demonstrate proof of concept, (2) explore and secure IP (3) develop a business plan and (4) perform a market analysis. The overall goal is to develop general antiviral treatments made available to virus-infected individuals through a public foundation in low-income areas or through a company in the Western world.",0,0
1137,196697,No,Reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint by implementing Collect and Reflect(TM) blinds for solar energy collection and reflection (Collect and Reflect),"Rising energy bills is a relevant topic for households in the European Union. The share of household income spent on energy bills is growing and is impacting not only low-income households. Many of existing solutions for lowering energy bills for households are expensive and are targeted at home owners. They include new passive buildings, better insulation of existing buildings and/or generation of locally renewable energy (e.g. geo-thermic, solar, wind).  Even though many already proven solutions exist that aim to increase energy efficiency and energy production in buildings via walls and roofs, windows are usually considered as a subject of energy loss and not taken into account for sustainable energy production. Could we optimize certain features of windows, such as blinds, and how should we do it? We believe that in the future, window blinds could add additional warmth in the winter and help to keep rooms cool in the summer; become a source of light; produce electricity; and when needed, block or let light in. By working on the Collect & Reflect project, Saulės vėjo aruodai (SVA) is making first steps to realize this dream by inventing blinds that can heat and cool. SVA, an SME from Lithuania, invents, patents, makes and supplies solar energy transformation products. Recently SVA has invented a break-through solution, Collect & Reflect(TM) thermal blinds, which can help save energy and thus reduce energy bills and decrease the carbon footprint of households. These blinds have innovative technology and special coating that make rooms warmer during the winter and colder in the summer. They help to decrease the need to heat and cool rooms, which results in lower energy bills and lower CO2 emissions. Collect & Reflect(TM) thermal blinds have huge potential to affect the window treatment market worldwide and transform traditional blinds into an active energy saving tool accessible for any household.",0,0

576,50725,Yes,Development of an earth observation data converter with application to air quality forecast,"The objectives of the DECAIR project are to improve urban air quality models by providing them with high quality input data derived from Earth Observation (EO). A demonstrator, able to manage and to automatic ally converts EO data into air quality model input data will be designed. It will be applied for the operational forecast of air pollution at Berlin and Madrid. The project identifies two levels of customers: scientists from companies and research institutions (henceforth, called model-users), who need input data for their simulation models (meteorological, topographic and emission data), and end-users (local authorities, health, traffic, decision makers) who need atmospheric and air quality models for scenario analysis and forecast on European urban areas. The air quality models used to perform these tasks can be considerably enhanced if provided with high quality input data. Increasing data spatial resolution, freshness and availability can do achieving this. The project identifies the model data that can be fruitfully supplied by EO. This will be done by using commercial solutions if available, or build on recent advances on EO data processing. Research tasks are foreseen to estimate model data that might be provided by EO. An additional key aspect of the project is to define a proper data management structure to improve and facilitate the use of EO satellite images. A common DECAIR database conceptual model will be defined to accommodate the various needs of general model-users, e.g., not limited to the users that take part in the project. The use of a common pivot database between model-users and EO information sources enables to deal with the various semantic and physicalheterogeneity aspects of the information sources. Thus, model users will have a uniform and global view of the data input data that can be derived from the EO sources.  DECAIR will build on concepts and techniques already developed and evaluated to:(i) refresh the database and (ii) define an universal access service to DECAIR's customers, based on WWW and internet communication networks. The definition of this data management structure will be done according to most recent studies, and should enable the use of the DECAIR approach to other application sites, different modelling scales and finally different environmental application.",0,1

787,46894,No,"Manufacture of finished articles and textiles from adjustable highperformance attributed, polypropene resin based yarns","Development and application of catalyst systems of high efficiency deliver polymers which are characterised by their MFR value being in the range of 10-40 g/10min. Elaboration of extrusion conditions in relation to properties of applied polymers in order to achieve improved productivity and yarn characteristics allows recommendations for the main settings. This knowledge will be a tool for every producer in order to adapt the processing of the new products to their production lines.  By investigation of yarn processing by the institutes, an indication of the range of settings for drawing, texturisation or staple processes is given, which meet the specific polymer needs and foreseen end uses, e.g. as apparel, home, technical or automotive textiles. This has been the basis for transfer and adaptation into industrial production at SMEs. However, regarding the respective results of industrial yarn, textile and carpet production, the achievable quality was not as good as expected and only could be reached with one type of polymer type, so that there is only a limited added value to be foreseen when applying this polymer to production. For some special processes (coarse technical yarn) it was not possible to reach standard quality. This project aims to demonstrate on principle how to produce industrially textile articles, like fabrics and carpets, of better perfommance by processing yarns on existing machinery exhibiting improved properties with respect to tenacity, resilience, abrasion resistance etc. The yarns will be based upon new types of polypropene, which are going to be manufactured by the use of metallocene catalysts. In addition to offering higher quality products made from these materials it is intended to increase productivity by means of producing at higher speeds. Regarding economic objectives being ever present towards lower costs and higher profits it will be possible on the one hand to increase sales due to the higher productivity and on the other hand to increase competitiveness due to the lower production costs and the better quality, which is produced. In order to reach the appropriate technical aims it will be necessary to adjust polymer properties to processing conditions and resulting yarn, fabric and carpet properties, and vice versa. In detail, to start with, tacticity and molecular weight of the metallocene catalysed polypropene will be varied to generate a broad range of different polymers. Processing these polymers to different yarns, extrusion temperature, processing speed (POY process) and yarn count (CF/BCF types, microfibres) will be varied. Yarn processing with respect to drawing, texturizing and production of staple fibres will be investigated by means of variation of e.g. draw ratio, drawing temperature, processing speed etc., as well as, with production of fabrics and carpets processability will be detemmined depending on production speed. Subsequently product properties resulting from these changes in processing conditions will be monitored by appropriate testing methods in order to indicate, firstly, the achievable improvements of physical textile properties, and, secondly, to indicate a range for those relevant settings, which later on can be used by every producer as a basis to adapt and optimise this new method to manufacture tailor made products to his own production lines. Finally, the overall success of this project will strongly depend on an efficient co operation and a frank communication between the participants throughout the entire project.",0,0

Benefiting from a longitudinal record which extends through a long historical period (1500–1920), the project embarks on establishing patterns of Bulgaria’s population dynamics, while at the same time, by utilizing customized Historical GIS (HGIS) applications it allows for the tracking of changes not only over time but also across space, and so offer a new perspective on the interaction between population developments related to climatic, environmental, natural, socioeconomic and political processes. Hence, it aims at carrying fundamental research that will expand the frontiers of scientific knowledge and will offer benefits to scientific understanding of historical population dynamics, accounting for the geospatial and temporal patterns in these processes. The project not only fills in a gap in the population geography of modern Bulgaria’s territory during the Ottoman and post-Ottoman period, but also offers a methodological solution for the exploitation of Ottoman population and tax records for reliable population data of other parts of Southeastern Europe, something which is still notably missing from the general European population map for the historical period under study.",0,0
610,38950,Yes,Making new local policies against social exclusion in European citi es. Ecosocial approach and social impact assessment in social work,"Since the integrative function of the labour market in European post-industrial societies is seriously weakening, the significance of citizens' living area as a key environment of social integration becomes crucial. However, the living areas of European cities once built for working people of industrial society, do structurally ignore the comprehensive social needs of unemployed citizens of today. Consequently the processes of exclusion in European cities are a ticking social and economic time bomb, if the changed demand for living environment with options of participation cannot be responded to. To effect these processes on the local level of policy making, new analytical approaches for identifying the interrelation between social exclusion/integration and the quality of living environment are extreme necessary.  The main objective of the project is to influence the local policy making from the margialized people's point of view concerning social environment as a risk/ a resource for social integration in the context of different European urban areas.   The detailed objectives are:   - To provide effective methods of social work, that enable especially the unemployed citizens to improve their environment through participation (Social Action, Community Empowerment, Self-employment).   - To apply the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) as citizens' and social work's tool to influence city planning and local decision-making towards a new social sustainability ((re)constructions, service and traffic politics, space utilisation).   - To advance the European social work's theoretical knowledge on the ecosocial dimensions of exclusion processes in different urban contexts (combining the system theoretical and ecological approaches and the new urban poverty research).   To meet these objectives effectively, the innovative aspect of the project is its organisation based on an European and on local networks. Focused field projects are carried out in already existing successful local cooperation with scientific actors (researchers and educators) and end-users (social and youth workers, public authorities) in three countries (FI, DE-East, GB). These case and action research studies from different local contexts are systematically compared on the European level contributed by the Swedish expert (SE) on community work research.   The included cities represent different paces and states of modernisation of European post-industrial societies. British social work is already used to take place in multicultural environments with high rate unemployment. The British partners have excellent experiences in social action 'from bottom up' in partnership with citizens.  Finland as a Scandinavian welfare state is now facing extremely high new unemployment and deep changes in welfare systems. The Finnish partners are pioneers of ecosocial approach especially in terms of developing SIA-Criteria and applying it by public authorities ('from top down'). The changes in East-Germany are analogous to Finland but even more dramatically due to the rapid re-construction of urban environment and the de-industrialisation. East-German social work is still open for different new concepts, and the East-German partners are specialised in models of ecosocial reform policies and in identifying the correlation between social exclusion and environment. These unique competencies of each partner directly contribute to the detailed objectives of the project and enable an innovative mutual European exchange.  The project's results on the European level will be advanced practicable models of social integration and policy making as well as a radical new theoretical perspective to social exclusion processes emphasising the ecosocial dimensions in social work.  These results are applicable in different kinds of European post-industrial urban areas, that all share the mentioned new urgent risks.",1,1
443,210792,Yes,Mobility Urban Values,"'MUV (Mobility Urban Values) levers behaviour change in local communities in an entirely novel approach to reducing urban traffic. Rather than focus on infrastructure, it raises citizen awareness on the quality of the urban environment to promote a shift towards more sustainable and healthy mobility choices. MUV solutions are co-created and validated with learning communities in six diverse urban neighbourhoods – Buitenveldert in Amsterdam (NL), Sant Andreu in Barcelona (ES), Muide/Meulested in the harbour of Ghent (BE), the historic district of Fundao (PT),  Jätkäsaari in Helsinki (FI) and the 'Centro Storico' of Palermo (IT) – and extended to additional communities through open calls to join the network and adopt the MUV approach. MUV's technological ecosystem integrates three components: a mobile and wearable app, a distributed network of environmental monitoring stations (co-designed with local maker communities) and a scalable cloud platform to collect, aggregate and analyse data. The massive amount of data collected throughout MUV communities feeds local planning and policy-making processes to develop frugal and effective urban mobility solutions. Creativity and artistic design maximize local impact and the diffusion of project results beyond the communities directly involved. MUV’s ground-breaking approach thus achieves sustainable mobility through a blend of methods: co-creation, awareness raising, gamification, reward systems, new forms of communication, artistic design, ICT and data science, additive manufacturing, and open governance.  Rather than embark in investments with long and uncertain paybacks, MUV empowers communities to better translate citizen needs into new solutions, engaging end-users throughout the process to prevent the risk of low take-up. Real impact is measured with an evidence-based approach to maximize economic viability and Social Return On Investment (SROI) and drive replicability and the scaling up and out of MUV solutions.'",1,1

This objective will be addressed through the demonstration of a compact polymer and silicon-based CMOS-compatible photonics sensor system. It integrates two label-free biomolecular recognition photonic sensor technologies with sensitivities as low as 0.1ng per ml, state-of-the-art in label-free integrated optical biosensors, with novel coupling technology that will permit very high integration of hundreds of sensing areas on a 1mm2 photonics chip. This offers the further advantageous possibility of assaying several parameters simultaneously leading to further increases in the reliability and reductions in the measurement uncertainty of a diagnostic over single-parameter assays. The novel diagnostic technology of the InTopSens device has the potential to be fast and easy to use, making routine screening or monitoring of bacteria more cost-effective. The ultimate target of InTopSens is to demonstrate the feasibility of a rapid diagnostic test for sepsis at 'point of care'. From the introduction onto the chip of a large drop of blood (some 5ml) it will have after 5-10 mins a yes/no to the presence of bacteria and after less than 30mins an antibiotic resistance profile of the infecting bacteria. Some 120 sensing areas/datapoints are needed to identify this profile and as such due to the very high integration up to 250 assays can be integrated onto a 1mm2 chip for the same bacteria for higher sensitivity/selectivity or for other bacteria. A final prototype consisting of a packaged biochip will be used on clinical samples in order to detect the sepsis bacteria and determine their resistance to antibiotics.",0,0
224,87763,No,Cell permeable peptides as drug delivery system: a way towards innovative therapeutic strategies for neurodegeneration,"Peptides and small molecules able to modulate protein-protein interaction as well as intracellular pathways leading to neurodegeneration and cell death hold a great potential as innovative therapeutic strategies with which to probe and manipulate biological pathways. The need to deliver these biologically active agents into cells has encouraged to develop various transducing vectors.  In this view, cell permeable peptides conjugates represent a novel, versatile and extremely powerful way of blocking the propagation of intracellular signaling events or intracellular protein complexes, thus being an useful tools for both creating innovative animal models and to design innovative therapeutic strategies. The project aims to foster a dynamic pathway between academic research organizations and private commercial enterprises based on a longer term co-operation programme in the field of innovative therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. The project will focus on the following specific objectives:  i) Identify and verify appropriate targets, making use of innovative animal models to develop blocking/inhibitory small molecules; ii) Design appropriate cell permeable peptides and develop proteases resistant vectors. The projects goal will be sustained by concrete transfer of knowledge assured by bidirectional secondments and recruitment of external expertise. Further, the strong complementarities of competencies of the partners involved will be instrumental: through knowledge sharing and intersectorial mobilities the project will lead to develop new generation of drugs tackling with unprecedented specificity pathways of degeneration in neuronal cells. The intersectorial two-ways transfer of knowledge proposed in the project will strongly accelerate the all process from ideation to application of novel potential drugs for neurodegeneration and will speed up the advancement of research capability and the competitiveness of the partners involved.",0,0

Its first goal is to develop products in the area of Managing Applications (MAs) which solve genuine management problems in working networks with real users. These MAs will be specified by the operators of the networks. Management will be based on the ISO standards for network management. The MAs will be developed with the aid of platforms developed within the MIDAS project.  In order to ensure that the project's work has wide applicability, the results will be demonstrated in two contrasting situations. In the first, the target will be a public administration network operated by one of the industrial partners. Here the users work in public administration and employ OSI applications such as X.400 mail and X.500. In the second, the target will be a set of workstations connected to an office LAN via the public ISDN. Here the user will be homeworkers engaged in various office activities. In addition to conventional OSI applications, novel applications involving images and computer conferencing will be used. At the start of the project a requirements analysis work package, led by the operators of the public administration network, will determine the MAs to be developed for the two networks. Close attention will be paid to the need for management to take a global view of a distributed application. The opportunity of using AIP techniques to this end will be evaluated. The MAs developed will allow the control of applications and communications as well as merely monitoring their behaviour.   The systems being managed (the Managed Systems or MSs) must present an external view that accords with the requirements of the OSI management model. This view encompasses both the protocols to be used when management information is transferred as well as the nature and structure of the management information itself. The development of managed versions for X.400, X.500 and ISDN products is the second important goal of MIDAS. A subsidiary goal of the project will be the implementation of these platforms.   In order to operate successfully, support services must be available. OSI directory services will be used to store static configuration information about the networks, the user and the MAs. The proper interaction between the directory and the MAs will be carefully considered. Security services are vital, as it is intended that management information should be securely held and that control actions should be properly authorised.

588,52651,Yes,Innovative IST Platforms and Services to Support a Democratic Regional/Urban Planning Process,"The aim of the AGORA 2000 project is to develop innovative multimedia and integrated platforms and services designed to bridge the gap between citizens and regional/urban decision makers by creating an improved and easy-to-use on-line information access system, which will allow the participation to the regional/urban planning process. Indeed, democratic decision-making requires easy interaction between private citizens, elected representatives and those who are charged with advising, and implementing decisions. It is therefore vital that any planning process should leave space for discussion between the planners and both local authorities and the public. The project involves regional and urban decision makers from the following areas/ countries: Tuscany and Valle Maira (I), Aquitaine (F), Anatoli (EL), Valencia (E).  OBJECTIVES The AGORA 2000 project will define, specify and develop a networked, interactive and open AGORA Platform supporting regional/urban decision-makers in the territory planning process with monitored involvement of the citizens. The project is to provide a system which will (1) support the planning authorities by providing the means to present alternative solutions to a planning problem and quantitative parameters allowing for the comparison of them, and (2) support the public by providing a unified interface to all relevant planning information systems. Thus a planning decision will be explained and will invite comments from the public.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The project will start identifying the user requirements for an improved and more democratic Regional/Urban Planning process, and subsequently it will undertake the definition of a global system architecture to support Planning actors and the debate with the public. Then, the specification and implementation of a set of networked, multimedia and open tools will be addressed to build an advanced Web-based 3D-GIS system to efficiently create a realistic computer model of a urban/rural area which can then be used for interactive fly and walk-through demonstrations. Finally, the project will be engaged in the specification, implementation and subsequent extensive validation of IST support of the new re-designed Planning process in four member states (Italy, France, Greece and Spain). The system and services will be based on the proper use of the following new technologies: 3D GIS (to allow an easy search and access to the specific planning project under decision), Web-based technology (to allow an easy access to the AGORA 2000 system), high-band telecommunication technologies (to allow the transfer of the huge amount of data related to 3D graphic representations), and workflow technology (to monitor the execution of the different steps and enact the interaction protocols with the external components). The project is a 30-month effort led by Municipality of Macra (I) as Financial Co-ordinator, by SATA (I), an Italian IT company, as Technical Co-ordinator, and includes other IT organisations (ERGON (EL), Business Flow Consulting (F), APLITEC (E) as Subcontractor) and a company with expertise in Civil Architecture and Infrastructures (PATMOS (I) as Subcontractor), all active in the public sector. The consortium includes also committed European Administrations, with a deep interest in the enlargement of the planning activities to other societal components and ultimately to the citizens, through the use of the AGORA 2000 prototypes, such as the Tuscany (I) and Aquitaine (F) Regional Governments and the City Governments of Macra (Valle Maira, I), Valencia (E) and Anatoli (EL).",1,1
360,218591,No,Spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity shape neural circuits in the developing brain,"To generate brain circuits that are both flexible and stable requires the coordination of powerful developmental mechanisms acting at different scales. How does the brain prepare to efficiently compute information and reliably generate behavior during early development without any previous experience? A prominent transient feature of developing circuits is the ability to generate spontaneous activity before sensory organs mature. We know little about the detailed structure of this activity; however, blocking or perturbing this activity leads to miswiring defects, suggesting its powerful role in shaping local and brain-wide neural circuits. After the onset of sensory experience, ongoing activity continues to modify sensory circuits, and plays an important functional role in the mature brain. Together with advances in experimental techniques, we propose that theory and models are needed to establish a unifying framework of neural circuit development. Using quantitative data analysis, experiment-driven theory and computational modeling, we will derive key principles for how neural circuits are built and organized during early postnatal development into functional units, and how they are modified by intact and perturbed sensory-evoked activity. We will provide a quantitative analysis of longitudinal recordings of single neuron and network activity for the first time by synthesizing data from three collaborating labs. Our goal will be to reveal novel aspects of this activity that drive circuit refinement over a prolonged timescale during development, and to identify the powerful ways in which activity and circuit properties influence each other. Our models will generate and test hypotheses for how individual components affect different aspects of circuit organization during development. Therefore, the unique potential of our theoretical approach lies in dissecting the influence of each developmental process, making predictions to be tested in the real biological system.",0,0
1034,95813,No,Single Molecule Enzymology with ClyA Nanopores,"Single molecules based techniques provide the ultimate toolkit to study complex biological systems. In single-molecule approaches, molecules do not need to be synchronised as in ensemble studies, and rare and/or transient species along a reaction pathway as well as heterogeneity and disorder in a sample can be revealed. Observing and manipulating single molecules, however, is generally complicated, time consuming and withstand several technical limitations that hamper the study of single enzymes to a few selected examples.  Here I am proposing to develop a new technology to study single native enzymes that is sensitive, simple and inexpensive, and has a temporal resolution ranging from few ¼seconds to hours.  Nanopores have been used to detect single molecules and to investigate mechanisms of chemical reactions at the single molecule level. The basic concept of nanopore analysis is to observe, under an applied potential, the disruption of the flow of ions through the pore caused by the interaction of the molecules of interest with a binding site within the pore. Similarly, small enzymes or functional nucleic acids will be attached to the vestibule of a biological nanopore via disulfide bridge or click chemistry. The conformational changes associated with catalysis will then be observed by the altered ionic flow through the pore. In addition, when a charged chaotropic agent is placed on the trans side of the bilayer, the applied potential will allow the directional control of the flow of the chaotropic agent through the pore that, ultimately, also will control the unfolding and refolding of the protein attached to the pore. This will allow investigations of reversible unfolding processes far from equilibrium at the single molecule level for the first time.",0,0

1188,214694,No,Towards prevention of autoimmune diseases: the case of rheumatoid arthritis,"A common feature of autoantibody-positive autoimmune disease is that the disease-associated autoimmunity often appears many years prior to clinical onset and can hence be used to identify risk groups for future disease development. Autoantibody-positive (seropositive) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) provides a unique setting due to recent insights in the longitudinal development of the disease, suggesting that autoantibodies develop in genetic susceptible individuals as a consequence of specific environmental challenges (such as smoking) to only later on target the joints. The main objectives of the current program are: (1). To dissect the longitudinal development of seropositive RA and gain a detailed understanding of the processes responsible for autoantibody generation outside the joints, and specifically at the mucosal sites.  (2). To develop new ways to identify seropositive disease-susceptible individuals and map targetable life style factors and immune events responsible for this susceptibility.  (3). To elucidate the mechanisms by which systemic autoimmunity targets the joints to first induce bone loss and pain and only in a second phase chronic joint inflammation.   If successful our project will not only allow efficient identification of RA-susceptible individuals, but also deliver new tools for risk estimation in each of these individuals and novel ways of intervention in order to delay, or in the best case prevent disease development.

Such a shift would of course be highly detrimental to the achievement of the general objectives of a sustainable development of the European transport system. The project would also find the best balance between environmental and economical requirements, in order to avoid an always possible shift from rail transport to a less sustainable mode like road, even on electrified main routes would also encourage the engine industry to give rail applications serious consideration in their product development plans and provide the European Commission with proposals for a flexible move to the IIIB objective.

512,194438,Yes,Smart City performance measurement system,"The European Commission has developed two parallel approaches to support the implementation of smart urban technologies: the creation of 'lighthouse projects' (large scale demonstration of technology in cities and communities) and 'horizontal activities' to address specific challenges (e.g. regulatory barriers, in standardisation, public procurement and performance monitoring). CITYKEYS project is within the context of these horizontal activities. The mission of CITYKEYS is to develop, and validate, a holistic performance measurement framework for future harmonized and transparent monitoring and comparability of the European cities activities during the implmeatation of Smart City solutions. The work methodology will be based on the following key factors: • Extensive collaboration and communication with European cities.  • Establish a baseline by analysis and integration of existing results from previous initiatives. • Develop a set of KPIs specific for Smart Cities initiatives evaluation and comparability • Smart solutions for transparent and open data collection and processing. The tangible objectives of the CITYKEYS project are to: 1) Develop and validate a transparent performance evaluation framework: including KPIs definition, guidelines for data collections, performance system prototype and testing in case-cities. 2) Develop recommendations for the implementation of the performance system into the cities decision-making process and recommendations for the development of new business. 3) Engage stakeholders in identifying and exploiting opportunities for synergy and replicability; and establish a collaboration platform for European cities. The consortium includes 3 multidisciplinary research organizations, 1 cities association and 5 partner cities covering different geographical regions in Europe and different urban realities. In addition to the 5 partner cities, 15 others shown their commitment to join the project stakeholders advisory group.",1,1
534,219241,Yes,REmote SEnsing techniques for ARCHaeology,"Europe has rich and diverse cultural heritage resources, which include urban and rural landscapes, comprising standing monuments and archaeological remains. Nowadays Europe’s Cultural Heritage (CH) is at risk, endangered by environmental processes and anthropogenic pressures. Physical and chemical destruction and degradation of structures and artefacts amplify the natural deterioration and reduce the ability of the soil to preserve CH. In addition to physical damages, the intensive human activities and the effects of climate changes are responsible of the increase of soil erosion affecting structure stability and producing significant negative consequences on the conservation of the archaeological artefacts. In this scenario, authorities in charge to CH preservation have a strong requirement for systematic, effective, usable and affordable tools and services to monitor the degradation process to enable preventive maintenance and to reduce the cost of the restoration. The broad spectra of Satellite Earth Observations (EO) provide the ideal platform to undertake a wide range of effective, cost-efficient and up-to-date programmable analysis, as a support to traditional tools. RESEARCH addresses the design and development of a multi-task platform, combining advanced remote sensing technologies with GIS application for mapping and long term monitoring of archaeological CH in order to identify changes due to climate changes and anthropic pressures. The EO processing chain will address the major risks affecting CH including the degradation due to soil erosion, land movement and vegetation as well as risks due to anthropic pressure. RESEARCH will coordinate the existing expertise and research efforts of seven beneficiaries into a synergetic plan of collaborations and exchanges of personnel to offer a comprehensive transfer of knowledge and training environment for the researchers in the specific area.",0,1
1244,107241,No,Riding on Moore's Law,"The most common interpretation of Moore's Law is that the number of components on a chip and accordingly the computer performance doubles every two years. At the end of the 20th century, when clock frequencies stagnated at ~3 GHz, and instruction level parallelism reached the phase of diminishing returns, industry turned towards multiprocessors, and thread level parallelism. However, too much of the technological complexity of multicore architectures is exposed to the programmers, leading to a software development nightmare. We propose a radically new concept of parallel computer architectures, using a higher level of abstraction, Instead of expressing algorithms as a sequence of instruction, we will group instructions into higher-level tasks that will be automatically managed by the architecture, much in the same way superscalar processors managed instruction level parallelism. We envision a holistic approach where the parallel architecture is partially implemented as a software runtime, and the reminder in hardware. The hardware gains the freedom to deliver performance at the expense of additional complexity, as long as it provides the required support primitives for the runtime software to hide complexity from the programmer. Moreover, it offers a single solution that could solve most of the problems we encounter in the current approaches: handling parallelism, the memory wall, the power wall, and the reliability wall in a wide range of application domains from mobile up to supercomputers . We will focus our research on a most efficient form of multicore architecture coupled with vector accelerators for exploiting both thread and data level parallelism. All together, this novel approach toward future parallel architectures is the way to ensure continued performance improvements, getting us out of the technological mess that computers have turned into, once more riding on Moore's Law.",0,0
301,81171,No,Innovation through research opportunities,"There are very different capabilities to promote innovation and research in the different regions of Europe. One reason for this is due to the fact that social infrastructure and the innovative culture is very different through the continent. The INTRO project aims to build up social infrastructure that promotes regional innovation. The method will be to transfer the innovative spirit and processes from Iceland and South-east Ireland where rural and regional innovation has been systematically promoted to Poland's region of Lower-Silesia and to Latvia.  The objectives are to transfer best practice to the new member regions from: - Southeast Ireland in relation to SME innovation support, methods of creating innovative and entrepreneurial culture and successful exploitation of research. Ireland's experience of promoting entrepreneurial culture, especially within SMEs, and successfully supporting exploitation of research results will be of great benefit to the partner regions since their main barriers for achieving economic growth is lack of entrepreneurial an innovative activity. - Iceland in relation to urban-rural cooperation, methods and processes creating local interest for education and research as enablers to innovation. Especial attention will be given to current organisation of regional Knowledge Centres that are clusters of regional education, research and innovation centres. The experience of building up support infrastructure, IT infrastructure and methods of enhancing innovative environment thro ugh education and research will be of great benefit to the partner regions.  The regions in Poland, Lower-Silesia, and in Latvia will be introduced to best practices related to education, innovation and research, through measures and pilot actions that have already been tested and tried in Ireland and Iceland.

938,67743,No,Genetic predictors of antidepressants response,"The present research project was focused on the study of the molecular basis (DNA analysis ) of the response to antidepressant treatments in Mood Disorders. We studied different responses of patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls ) that are the most used antidepressant drugs for their efficacy and relatively favourable side effect profile compared to trycicJic antidepressants (Masand and Gupta, 1999; SchIoss and Williams, 1998). The possible definition of a genetic liability profile for drugs side effects and efficacy could be of great help in treatments that need weeks to months to be effective Up to now few clinical features are available for an early recognition of responders and this is absolutely insufficient. Converging evidences suggest that genetic predisposition plays an important role in antidepressant response. During the last years, the Research Unit of Mood Disorders ofS. Raffaele Hospital in Milan (where this studied was performed) has reached a very high scientific results in the field of pharmacogenomics. In particular, the efficacy and time of onset of SSRls have been associated with a polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTPR), that is a prime target of SSRIs, by many independent studies; at the same time, variants at the tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH), serotonin receptor 2A (5.HT2A) have been associated with them in pilot studies (Serretti et al., submitted. a; Serretti et al., 2001a; Serrettiet aLlOO!b; Smeraldi et al., 1998; Zanardi et aJ., 2000; Zanardi et al., 2001). These studies demonstrated that treatment with SSRls appears to be, at leas! to some extent, under generic influence and preliminary data identified possible liability genes, Nevertheless, serotonin transporter gene variant (5-HTTPR) and tryptophan hydroxylase polymorphic gene (TPH) explain 7% and 5% of the total variance of antidepressant response respectively.

898,31564,No,Use of integrated graphical and textual formal specification languages in industry,"The aim of the UseGat project is to demonstrate the suitability and viability of combining structured and formal methods, in particular SA/RT and VDM, to develop real large-scale applications.  UseGat focuses on measuring the initial investment needed to incorporate such a technology in an industrial environment and its effect on the quality and costs. The results of this assessment will be re-deployed and disseminated to practitioners.  The combination of formal and structured methods is proposed to reduce the barriers and risks in technology transfer of the formal methods. We advocate 'validation through animation' as a way of introducing formal methods to industry in a stepwise manner. This makes it possible to bring testing activities forward to the specification phase of the development life-cycle. This avoids the barriers of using formal methods for verification of specifications which are recognised to be a major obstacle in the uptake of formal methods.  In UseGat the IDERS SDA tool will be customised to support the Hatley & Pirbhai SA/RT graphical notation and the textual formal language VDM-SL.  The project has a planned duration of 18 months. The UseGat project has links to a number of CEC projects, in particular the Esprit projects IPTES (5570 and 7811) and IDERS (8593).  The target industrial user is Ansaldo Trasporti, a leading Italian company in the field of railway control traffic systems. IFAD plays the role of technology provider, adapting the tools to the specific requirements that will arise during the project. ENEA plays the role of local supporter and will capture the specific needs from the end user. The end user will be trained by ENEA and IFAD, and ENEA will provide day-to-day assistance in the development of the real-life application. Ansaldo Trasporti will specify and implement a real-life application related to a railway signalling system.  The expected results from the UseGat project are:  - For Ansaldo Trasporti the introduction of a new technology into the organisation to help increase its market share of dependable products. It is expected that in case of a successful project the technology will be re-deployed in different applications at ATR as well as promoted to other organisations in the security-critical sector. - For ENEA the dissemination of the new technology to Italian industries. - For IFAD demonstration of the usefulness of its leading-edge technology, dissemination of results to European enterprises and deployment of its tools world-wide..  http://www.ifad.dk/",0,0
636,110506,Yes,Interoperable GCDC AutoMation Experience,"The objective of i-GAME is to develop technologies that speed-up the real-life implementation of automated driving, which is supported by communication between the vehicles and between vehicles and road-side equipment. These automated systems must be safe and able to cope (to a certain extend) with different circumstances. And the technology must not be too specific to be able to be used in a wide range of vehicles and traffic scenarios. For i-GAME the solution is found in so-called supervisory control, that provides both event-driven control to initiate vehicle manoeuvres (e.g. a car wants to merge on a highway) and real-time control to execute the manoeuvres (i.e. vehicles make a space for the merging vehicle and the merging vehicle steers into the empty space). These kind of scenario's require that the participating vehicles and road-side equipment are able to communicate and cooperate with each other, which is called interoperability. The interoperability in i-GAME is ensured on the one hand by a reference group of OEM's and suppliers, and, on the other hand, through the participating (university) teams in a second edition of the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge.For the design and setup or the automated systems i-GAME uses a  parallel  approach. Firstly, a  functional architecture  will be developed. The components of the system (like the communication and the overall supervisory control system) will be developed on simulation level first and then tested in practice using benchmark vehicles. Secondly, to  focus on interoperability and thus speed up real-life implementation, a series of verification and validation workshops is held, having its climax in the final challenge on cooperative automated driving, together with leading RTDs, and supported by OEMs and suppliers. Typical examples of multi-vehicle platoon manoeuvres that will be part of the challenge are platoon forming, priority and speed adaptation (including stop) at a traffic light, and automatic or supported vehicle merging based on fusion of in-vehicle and on-roadside information.This open approach creates a multi-vendor playground and should catalyse the scale-up and commercial roll out of vehicles equipped with the  automated solutions. Finally, the results  will be presented to stakeholders such as standardization bodies, road authorities, OEMs and suppliers  to create a new reference for practical implementation of automated driving solutions.",1,1

This generic approach will be developed by the project members and will involve practical, theoretical and modelling aspects. The devices developed will be applied to 2 different industrial systems to show the wide applicability to the chemical industry: the mononitration of benzene and the cyclization of b–ionone. Micro and meso-scale reactors will be operated at scales relevant to commercial production to demonstrate improved selectivity, yield and specific performance. A state-of-the-art experimental research facility will be designed and constructed; this will be modular, flexible and expandable to ensure flexibility of process and operation. Having developed an improved fundamental understanding of these multiphase processes and the design and operation of appropriate micro/mesostructured environments, the partners will codify this learning, in the form of a “toolkit”, to identify the most suitable continuous processing methods for any liquid/liquid system. This will allow operators to improve the sustainability of chemicals production by selecting intensified process methods that are both eco-efficient and offer increased safety.

1029,54427,No,Wastewater recycling of olive mills in mediterrenean countries - demonstration and sustainable reuse of residuals,"The partners will investigate cheap, cost-effective WWT technologies for the processing of olive oil wastewater (OMW) in the Mediterranean. At an experimental test plant biological aerobic treatment technologies (reed beds and Equalisation) will be compared with classical in-plant processes. Anaerobic treatment will be used to produce biogas (valorisation of waste). The effluent quality will be adapted to different reuse possibilities. (Milestone: Definition of water quality). Considering the experimental results a pilot WWTP for the treatment of OMW in Crete will be erected. During the operation of the plant the effluent quality will be economically and ecologically optimised, the biogas production will be maximised; Different reuse possibilities for the WW are investigated: production of plants (treatment and direct production of plants by Equalisation or water reuse in agriculture) and the production of bricks in a nearby brickyard. The objective of the WAWAROMED project was the treatment and reuse of olive mill wastewater (OMW), which in the Mediterranean region is normally stored in open basins and causes harmful ecological impact due to overflows during winter. The OMW was treated aerobically and anaerobically in order to reduce the organic pollution. COD removal rates of 89 % were achieved but the conductivity of the effluent was still high. In order to facilitate the treatment a new biological sedimenter, which combines the advantages of aerobically and anaerobically treatment was developed. This unit shows good removal rates for COD and phenolic compounds and was realized at an olive mill in Crete. As a second treatment technology Epuvalisation which uses plants in hydroponics to purify the wastewater was tested. Diluted wastewater flowed through gravity in channels in which plants were placed, and circulated for several days. Plants absorbed all the nutrients from the wastewater in order to feed, while their roots were operating as natural filters, withholding the solids the wastewater contained. In anaerobic treated OMW the reduction of COD with the Epuvalisation system, reached, 98%, after a few days (5-9) of effluent circulation in the channels. That reduction was more likely due to sludge settlement.  EC was also reduced due to K absorption from the plants. Some of the plants used in Epuvalisation system (Canna sp, Cyperus sp) adjusted very well in wastewater and got big in height with extended leaf canopy. Those plants were loosing great amounts of water through evapotranspiration. Test were made and in effluent with 33% of wastewater, more than 220 L/day/channel of wastewater effluent was lost through evapotranspiration, that means more than 70L of wastewater were lost per day. Experiments with lysimeter and field-grown olive tress, 20-year-old, were carried out in Chania, Crete, Hellas, in order to study the effects of winter application of OMW (after one day sedimentation) and summer irrigation with treated effluent (aerobic-anaerobic and epuvalization systems) on soil properties and tree performance. Seasonal application of 416 m3/ha of raw OMW (5 applications) for 3 years had no negative effects on plant physiology, nutritional status, yield and soil properties, while soil K increased, enhancing soil fertility. The analysis of leachate from 2 m soil treated with raw OMW in a lysimeter, clearly showed that pollution load (in terms of phenols and COD) was zero. Treated OMW effluent was generally suitable for summer irrigation of olives; however, the effluent from the aerobic-anaerobic treatment plant has to be diluted before used for irrigation. Toxicity tests had proved that the toxic effect of untreated OMW is given to living species. This shows once again the necessity for a treatment of the yearly huge amounts of OMW in the Mediterranean. Microbiological examinations were executed in order to separate special fungi and bacteria.  By this Aspergillus Niger and Geotrichum candidum were isolated, grown and added to the OMW treatment plants in Crete. The removal rate for especially phenolic compounds was increased in order to decrease the toxicity of the untreated and treated wastewater. The energy supply of the OMW treatment plant was designed in order to substitute parts of the conventional energy by renewable energies. A PV generator supplied electric energy and a solar-thermal system was planned to heat the anaerobic reactor up to 37 C. Calculations showed that this concept is useful for small scale treatment plant but for the large scale treatment plant the heating system was realized by a biomass system. The treatment and irrigation facilities will be in operation even after the end of the project due to a cooperation between the local university and the mill owner. Efforts will be taken in order to disseminate the results. In cooperation with the Moroccan partner, contacts to the local government of the city of Fes were worked out in order to realize a similar treatment plant with the developed technologies in Morocco.",0,0

Sets of realistic interventions will be proposed, tailored to local needs, to meet published abatement goals for GHG Emissions for 2020, 2030 and 2050.  Mitigation actions will be defined in four main sectors: power generation/industry, household energy, transport and food and agriculture.  The chief pathways by which such measures influence health will be described, and models developed to quantify changes in health-related ‘exposures’ and health behaviours.  Models will include ones relating to outdoor air pollution, indoor air quality and temperature, physical activity, dietary intake, road injury risks and selected other exposures.  Integrated quantitative models of health impacts will be based on life table methods encompassing both mortality and morbidity outcomes modelled over 20 year time horizons. Where possible, exposure-response relationships will be based on review evidence published by the Comparative Risk Assessment initiative or systematic reviews. Uncertainties in model estimates will be characterized using a mathematical framework to quantify the influence of uncertainties in both model structure and parameter estimates. Particular attention will be given to economic assessments, both in terms of behavioural choices/uptake of various forms of mitigation measure (with new surveys to address evidence gaps), and in terms of health benefits and costs calculated from societal, health service and household perspectives.

Demographic and socio-economic factors, as well as changes in business practices, will be taken into account for the purposes of the analysis. On the basis of the research findings, recommendations will be made on ways of combining statistics on tourism with those on mobility for transport purposes.  The principles and practices of visitor management of large, or unusual visitor flows will be analysed for a number of selected (sub)urban areas. These case studies will help identify opportunities of improving access to tourist attractions by other modes of transport than the private car. This will include the role of all local players i.e. transport operators (whether public or private), local authorities and the tourism industry, including tour operators, travel agents, hotels and reservation systems.  The main justification for this project is that the overall research will demonstrate how tourism statistics can be applied to related transport mobility, as well as providing lessons for urban and transport planners in managing tourism flows.   Integration of the data analysis with the best visitor management practices will lead to recommendations on the need for a Community transport initiative on visitor management, including a comprehensive research agenda, demonstration activities and recommendations for land-use planning and environment policies.  %",1,0
977,188908,No,Promoting Open Source in European Projects,"Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) is creating new R&D opportunities across Europe, particularly in an ICT context where projects require an adequate cooperation environment. Despite the numerous advantages of FLOSS as a cooperation model, however, most developed software faces a limited life cycle and applicability. The absence of a common platform where projects can publish their software - with reliable and trustworthy usage terms/conditions - creates adoption difficulties. As a result, software is re-invented within the ICT community, leading to duplication of effort and failed R&D opportunities.Adopting FLOSS paradigms will extend the lifetime and sustainability of ICT software, increasing contributions to and from the community. To achieve this vision it is necessary to: promote FLOSS for ICT projects, by removing existing obstacles, especially legal and business barriers; create a feedback loop for FLOSS usage in ICT projects that encompasses the EC and enables them to assess the true benefits of a FLOSS-driven model; enable long term exploitation of FLOSS through a sustainable model for ICT contributions.The PROSE proposal is a Coordination Action (CA) that targets these goals through a three-fold, complementary approach:(a) Create and manage a shared platform for FLOSS, capable of generating the required feedback loop;(b) Develop a training program that provides knowledge and learning about this shared platform, as well as legal and business aspects regarding the adoption of FLOSS;(c) Execute a dissemination program to increase awareness of the advantages of adopting a FLOSS-driven model in ICT projects.With these three coordination elements, the PROSE CA will increase the sustainability of FLOSS in ICT; thereby extending the reach of ongoing FLOSS efforts beyond their current boundaries, and thus increasing the R&D opportunities in the European space.",0,0

Vizlegal aims to solve these issues by converting public government information into data, and offering new tools to address these issues. We have built a sophisticated Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) system to grab pubic information, structure it, parse it, and put it into a growing legal Application Programming Interface (API).   This API serves a web application currently serving a growing list of customers. It is also serving a data marketplace provider for UK-based finance companies. We aim to expand our data extraction via ETL, and gain more customers via a) a focus on niche data ignored by other providers and b) a ratio of accessible information to price unseen before in the industry. We will be liberating closed data into open data, and serving a key industry in any member state, and internationally. We believe that the data we gather can offer enormously valuable future products in the analytics and intelligence sphere.",0,0
1132,224731,No,Solutions for outdoor climate adaptation,"The aim of SOLOCLIM is to develop a doctoral training programme that enables young researchers to generate solutions for urban outdoor. The aim of SOLOCLIM is to develop a doctoral training programme that enables young researchers to generate solutions for urban outdoor environments. Projections show that urbanisation could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050 and the cumulative effect of all the negative urban climate impacts of urbanisation such as the occurrence of urban heat islands as well as distinctive wind patterns in cities  create discomfort and health risks. As climate change will exacerbate these urban and microclimatic problems citizens need to be protected. As cities create their own climates, the solutions to these problems are to be found in the (re-)design of cities. Some solutions are known such as the use of vegetation, but there are still many remaining questions about the impact of vertical green as well as the proper distribution of green in cities to have an optimal effect. Moreover, upcoming systems using water vapour as a coolant as well as flexible systems that respond to microclimate have not been studied yet. SOLOCLIM will develop such solutions on different scale levels from small scale around buildings to a larger neighbourhood/city scale and test their effects. The industry in architecture, urban and landscape design is in need of these innovative solutions as climate adaptation in cities is one of the largest challenges for the future. All plans and designs that the industry develops have to respond to the urban (micro)climate challenges. Apart from the availability of solutions the industry also needs the expertise. This expertise involves design and research skills related to urban (micro)climate. SOLOCLIM trains experts in this field and offers a training for advanced climate responsive design that will be offered to the PhD students as well as some parts to a broader community and beyond the duration of SOLOCLIM.",1,0

Summary of the project  The project provides expert support to DG's in policy development and implementation as well as technical support for the thermal treatment of biomass, waste and waste-to-energy systems. The support is predominantly provided through operation of the PREWIN European network and under-pinning scientific/technical research in the areas of plant characterization, plant reliability improvements, emissions abatement technologies, performance and durability testing and test methodology development.  The project, originally called SAFTS at the beginning of FP5, was modified and extended following building the PREWIN European network that forced a broadening of the scope to encompass all aspects of the thermal treatment of waste processes and indeed biomass. With this broadened scope, a better and more complete service to both partner DGs and network members could be planned. The project is able to provide feedback information to DGs on the implementation of the new waste incineration Directive (2000/76/EC) and represents the EC in the 'Energy from Integrated Solid Waste Management Systems' Bio energy Task 36 of the International Energy Agency (IEA). An increase in manpower in 2001 facilitated a significant effort in the Enlargement process. As a consequence, the PREWIN network now has a growing number of members from the Candidate Countries. At the same time, increased manpower has enabled the provision of expanded technical services to the network by providing co-chairmen to the technical Task Groups, facilitating in particular work in the areas of emissions abatement and component durability assessment relevant to waste and biomass plant monitoring and flue gas cleaning systems.  See also the related EU enlargement process pre-accession (pa) project.  Rationale  Increasing concerns for the protection of the environment are leading to greater attention being focused on abatement of emissions. New, more stringent approaches to waste management have resulted in a greater emphasis on recycling and reduced landfill, and above all in tighter controls on emissions from waste incinerators. Incineration makes a very significant contribution to the treatment of the inevitably large quantities of waste. Nowadays the heat produced in the combustion process is used increasingly for electricity generation and district heating, which in turn reduces the needs for burning fossil fuels. There are, however, substantial technical problems associated with combustion of waste, and indeed biomass, both in terms of efficient and reliable plant operation and the reduction of emissions.  The PREWIN network was originally set up to work towards the development of best practices for emissions abatement and maximised efficiency in the waste incineration industry. In 2000, consideration was first given to the incorporation of biomass into CLEANWEB and at some stage in the future into PREWIN depending on the wishes of the network membership. The project aims to provide support to DGs through the collection of feedback on the implementation of the Incineration of Waste Directive and policy development in the area of sustainable energy production.",0,0
1146,211295,No,Innovative and highly-efficient solar thermal collector for Building façades,"Heating and cooling in our buildings accounts for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU. Moreover, 84% of heating and cooling is still generated from fossil fuels, while only 16% is generated from renewable energy. By improving the energy efficiency of buildings, we could reduce total EU energy consumption by 5-6% and lower CO2 emissions by about 5%. In 2016, the Commission proposed the EU Heating and Cooling Strategy that includes plans to make energy efficient renovations to buildings easier.  The EU/Global market is requesting a cost effective and high efficient solution. Current commercial solutions are of very low efficiency, expensive and not suitable for old buildings.  Asoluna, a Swedish SME that designs and manufactures solar energy solutions, has design and prototyped Prisma: a multifunctional solar thermal collector for integration in the building envelope in such forms as facades, decorative elements, parapets, glazing etc. It acts as a climate envelope that efficiently protects the building from unwanted heating or cooling, while at the same time delivering solar heating to the building’s systems. Crucially, it has been designed in collaboration with some of Europe’s leading sustainability architects to be easy to retrofit on to existing buildings.  Prisma exhibits the following characteristics: 1) 100 % renewable energy; 2) Patented; 3) Reduces annual energy costs by 50 % throughout the building’s life; 4) High efficiency (<80%); 5) Suitable for new and old buildings; 6) Easy to install; 7) Follows the statutory instruments, directives and standards for façade applications; 8)  Low environmental impact; 9) Cost effective; 10)  Unique design with no frame; 11) Various colours and shading available; 12) Designed by architects, for architects.  We anticipate that Prisma will be launched on to the market in 2020 and reaching sales of 28.5M€ by 2024, with a Net Present Value of 12M€ based on a project cost of SME phase II of 2M€%.",1,0
193,216148,No,Functionalized Magnetic Resonance Beacons for Enhanced Spectroscopy and Imaging,"'This project will develop and demonstrate molecular agents called functional magnetic resonance beacons (fMRBs). These will provide a new set of versatile spectroscopic tools for the spatially resolved study of chemistry, biochemistry, diffusion, flow and percolation inside opaque objects. The fMRB agents support hyperpolarized nuclear spin order, which generates enormously enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. The agents are designed to maintain such order for long times (between 5 minutes and several hours) in ambient temperature solution, enabling their transport deep inside opaque objects. The molecules are functionalized, so that they “light up' in an NMR or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment, upon triggering by specific chemical signals or physical conditions (sensory functionality), and may also to bind to selected molecular targets (binding functionality). One set of proposed realisations possesses “lock-and-key” functionality, meaning that the hyperpolarized nuclear spin order is “locked” into a form which is invisible in the NMR spectrometer, but which may be “unlocked” at any chosen time by applying a suitable radiofrequency pulse sequence. The following molecular moieties are proposed as storage modules: (1) molecular cages, such as functionalized C60 fullerenes, encapsulating noble gas atoms such as 3He; (2) spin clusters supporting long-lived states, such as pairs of 13C or 15N nuclei, in shielded molecular environments. The sensory moieties include tailored peptide sequences, which may be activated by the presence of particular proteases, while binding modules include moieties such as biotin. The agents are designed to be conveniently transportable in a hyperpolarized state. Potential long-term applications include in vivo molecular imaging by MRI. '",0,0
1176,211059,No,D-Band Radio solution Enabling up to 100 Gbps reconfigurable Approach for Meshed beyond 5G networks,"Nowadays there is a shared vision among industry, operators and academy that beyond 5G wireless networks will have to provide wideband wireless access and ubiquitous computing anywhere and at any time. The human life of the majority of the EU citizen will be surrounded by intelligent wireless sensors, which will bring radical changes to the way we live and do things. Supporting this scenario is a challenge for network operators and wireless network infrastructures and it will demand a tremendous performance improvement of medium range wireless infrastructure. This challenge needs to be addressed by a convergence of advanced semiconductor nanotechnology and a robust wireless infrastructure meshed network with seamless fiber performances.  The DREAM project, through the exploitation of the radio spectrum in D-band (130-174.8 GHz) with beam steering functionality, will enable wireless links with data rate exceeding current V-band and E-band wireless backhaul solutions by at least a factor of 10 and thus, it will bring wireless systems to the speed of optical systems. The DREAM project vision and objectives rely on a power efficient and silicon based BiCMOS transceiver analog front end, operating in D-band and enabling cost efficient deployment of meshed networks with seamless fiber performance. A beam steering integrated antenna array using an intelligent low-cost packaging technology prototype will be developed for the implementation of the beyond 5G network proof of concept in a realistic environment.  The DREAM consortium has a well-balanced and complementary known-how in the relevant areas for designing and demonstrating the feasibility of a small cell cellular network architecture based on meshed D-band backhaul links.

343,35573,No,Adaptive Composite Delamination Modelling,"The increased use of composite materials in industry, for example in the design of aircraft, helicopters, ships, trains, offshore structures, civil infrastructures, helmets, bicycles, biomedical implants, rackets, skis, etc., requires a detailed understanding of the behaviour of such composite components and structures to a wide range of potential loading. Components and structures using high performance long fibre composites are invariably laminated, and therefore very vulnerable to delamination since through thickness strengths are typically less than a thirtieth of the in plane strength. This hidden menace of Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) can reduce compression strength by more than 60%.   The maximum potential benefits derived from utilising composites rather than more traditional materials is at present severely limited by the enormous uncertainties in the design procedure, especially the damage tolerance, and are undoubtedly an obstacle to a more  widespread, cheaper and safer use of these materials. Potentially there are huge capital and lifecycle savings to be made by employing composite materials more economically and by reducing the  unnecessarily high factors of safety and over design which are currently in use.   The main thrust of the proposal is to develop a robust, mesh insensitive, generic delamination prediction algorithms. These improved delamination algorithms will be coupled to an optimum adaptive re meshing strategy, which uses IGES surface CAD information as a starting point.   The specific objectives are:    the development of an in plane 'intelligent' adaptive re meshing algorithm for the treatment of localisation in a physically realistic fashion. The algorithm will allow for automatic (rather than by predetermining the) location and refinement of the mesh at relevant sites throughout the FE mesh, without user intervention.   the development an out of plane 'intelligent' adaptive re meshing algorithm, which following convergence from the any in plane adaptive algorithm (initial stage), will introduce where necessary additional elements in the through thickness direction, again without user intervention.   to perform fatigue and impact testing for a range of potential laminated thermoset and thermoplastic composite coupon and small structural samples.   the development of reliable, more accurate and improved delamination models based on comprehensive numerical simulation for a range of advanced thermoset and thermoplastic composites. The ability to correctly predict localisation phenomena, and size effects is consider an important parameter.   to explore the use of statistical and probabilistic arguments for (i) adaptive re meshing and (ii) material variability in delamination modelling.   to demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms by comparing the numerical results extensive laboratory experimental test results.  All designers and users of composite materials acknowledge the inability of existing analysis methodologies to accurately predict the development of damage in their products. The proposed developments will be a major advance in overcoming this severe limitation, and will allow European industry to participate fully in a rapidlyevolving area that is set to expand dramatically in the new millennium and beyond.",0,0
403,62950,No,Role of inferior olive degeneration in nitrile-induced spastic paraparesis,"Epidemiological data link cassava consumption and konzo, an upper motoneurone disease characterized by spastic paraparesis. Cassava contains gluconitriles, mostly linamarin and the incidence of konzo correlates with urine concentrations of this compound. Trans-crotonitrile (TCN), an industrial nitrile, causes degeneration of the inferior olive, source of climbing fibres (CFs) to the cerebellum. Pilot studies have found that cerebellar CF field potentials are reduced in size after exposure to TCN or the metabolite of linamarin, acetonecyanohydrin (ACH). Hypothesis : Nitriles in cassava (linamarin, ACH, methyl-ethyl-ketonecyanohydrin, MEKCH) cause konzo through their neurotoxic action on the olive.Objectives : -Study transmission in CF and other sensorimotor pathways in anaesthetized rats exposed to linamarin, ACH or MEKCH. Prediction : effects of nitriles will be selective to the CF system.-Monitor changes in CF function and motor behavior in awake rats. Prediction : changes in CF excitability will be related to motor deficits.-Histological study of CNS. Prediction : functional deficits will be related to olivary degeneration.-Study spinal reflexes and muscle tone. Prediction : these will be increased as observed in konzo patients. The project will therefore contribute to the understanding of konzo and other spastic paraparesis syndromes, and of the role of the inferior olive in motor control. The applicant will learn specialized electrophysiological techniques and gain insights into the functional organization of central pathways critical in motor control.",0,0
30,104177,Yes,SMART MOBILITY IN SMART CITY,"Urban transport is responsible for about a quarter of CO2 emissions from transport. The gradual phasing out of 'conventionally-fuelled' vehicles from the urban environment is a major contribution to significant reduction of oil dependence, greenhouse gas emissions and local air and noise pollution. Fully Electric Vehicles (FEV), for public and private transport, can contribute significantly to the lowering of the current pollution levels. However, the FEV use is currently facing several weaknesses which are delaying its wider deployment, mainly related to overall limited efficiency and limited driving range.With this regard, MOBINCITY aims at the optimization of FEV autonomy range and the increase in energy efficiency thanks to the development of a complete ICT-based integrated system able to interact between driver, vehicle and transport and energy infrastructures, taking advantage of the information provided from these sources in order to optimise both energy charging and discharging processes (trip planning and routing).Main specific objectives are: To develop a system to be installed within the vehicle able to receive information from the surrounding environment, which can have influence in the vehicle performance (traffic information, weather and road conditions and energy grid). To optimise the trip planning and routing of FEV using information from these external sources including alternatives from other transport modes adapted to user's needs. To define efficient and optimum charging strategies (including routing) adapted to user and FEV needs and grid conditions. To implement additional energy saving methods (as driving modes and In-Car Energy Management Services) within the FEV interaction with the driver.In order to reach its objectives, MOBINCITY joins together an outstanding group of 13 partners, coming from five different countries, covering relevant sectors as traffic management, energy, ICT and telecommunications and automotive industry.",1,1
3,216297,Yes,Ligustinus Project: New Survey Techniques for an Ancient Riparian Landscape.,"The lacus Ligustinus was the great paleo-estuary of ancient Baetis or current Guadalquivir river (Southern Spain). It is a radically transformed landscape because of the intensive sedimentation and other geomorphological dynamics. The estuary banks were highly populated during the Roman period. Important cities and towns articulated the surrounding rural settlement, dedicated to the agricultural and livestock activities. In addition, the lacus allowed the connection with the maritime routes and the output of products destined to foreign markets. Nowadays this spatial configuration is difficult to restore, especially the exploitation villae settlement patterns. The main purpose of the project is to devise a methodology applicable to the study of the paleo-banks through the identification of archaeological sites. In that sense, the right border of the current Lower Guadalquivir region has been selected as a delimited study area, and particularly a local region of Cadiz province. The historical diachronic evolution will be analysed through the archaeological evidences. In order to achieve this, geomorphological, archaeological and other historical data from this area will be integrated in a GIS. Then survey methodology, such as geophysical survey, and UAV flights applications, will be applied in the local scale considering it as a continuum area, to detect archaeological sites employing non-invasive prospection techniques. We will apply this methodology through the selection of a series of study cases. The project will be carried out in the Laboratory of Landscape Archaeology & Remote Sensing (LAP&T) at University of Siena. This laboratory is specialised in survey and integral analysis of ancient landscapes. There the candidate will be trained in the application of these techniques in order to acquire skills for the interpretation of the collected data.",0,1

To address the challenges inherent of ULS as well as other key requirements of the Future Internet, such as fusion of the user/developer/system roles, adaptability and QoS-awareness, to name a few, CHOReOS revisits the concept of choreography-based service composition in service-oriented systems. CHOReOS introduces a dynamic development process, and associated methods, tools and middleware sustaining the ever-adaptable composition of services by domain experts – being the users of business choreographies – in the Future Internet. CHOReOS concepts then encompass formally grounded abstractions and models, dynamic choreography-centric development process, governance and service-oriented middleware, thus providing an Integrated Development &amp; Runtime Environment (IDRE) aimed at overcoming the ULS impact on software system development. Formally grounded abstractions and models enable reasoning about the properties, both functional and non-functional, of ULS choreographies. Dynamic choreography-centric development process allows the fusion of the user/developer/system roles, while managing the ULS service base, and supports the synthesis of scalable and adaptable choreographies. Governance includes service integration policies and rules, as well as tools for dynamic verification &amp; validation of choreographies. Finally, service-oriented middleware enables adaptable choreographies over ESB-based middleware, Grids, Clouds, and technologies for the Internet of Things, thus overcoming scalability and heterogeneity issues of the Future Internet. Last but not least, CHOReOS assesses the industrial exploitation of this choreography-centric vision by experimenting on three demanding use cases in different domains (passenger-friendly airport, mobile-enabled coordination of people, vehicular network) and by carrying out a study of social-technical factors.",0,0

To effectively implement energy and climate policies, concerted and strong action is needed. Municipalities often have ambitious goals and political will, but lack the harmonized, interdepartmental and long-term structures to successfully implement their climate and energy strategies and thus reach their goal.  This is the starting point for the project, which focuses on capacity building in municipalities. By introducing the quality management and certification programme European Energy Award (eea) in Belgium, Croatia, Greece and Poland, the project aims at setting up the necessary structures in municipalities. During the project, 30 pilot municipalities will further develop and implement their climate and energy strategy by using the eea standards and criteria catalogue. External advisors will guide and monitor the continuous progress. Its certification will ensure that municipalities implement their climate and energy plans to high quality standards. The certification process is ongoing and ensures that municipal climate action progress. Their experiences and successes will pave the way for more municipalities in the target regions to join the eea.   IMPLEMENT’s objective is to set up the necessary structures for a long-term roll-out of the eea in the partner countries. Partners will translate and adapt all eea tools to national context, receive adequate training to become skilled eea advisors, able to advice and guide pilot municipalities through the eea process.

907,214013,No,SLEEP IN THE CITY:  How does artificial light at night affect EEG-based measures of sleep?,"Sleep is an adaptive state of inactivity, which plays critical functions including replenishing energy and neurological recovery.  Artificial light at night (ALAN) is ubiquitous in the urbanizing world, and has the potential to substantially alter sleep patterns. Our understanding of how ALAN affects sleep in wild animals is seriously limited, because past studies have relied on behavioural metrics of sleep, which cannot distinguish different types of sleep (rapid eye movement (REM) versus slow wave sleep (SWS)), or accurately quantify sleep intensity (amount of slow waves within SWS).  In this study (CitySleep), the Experienced Researcher (ER) will use state-of-the-art neurologgers to obtain electroencephalogram (EEG) data on sleep in wild great tits (Parus major) exposed to ALAN.  She will obtain data from free-living nestlings and from adults in semi-natural aviaries.  Great tits sleep in nest boxes that can be experimentally exposed to ALAN, and have served as a model species in behavioural sleep studies.  The ER will work with the University of Antwerp’s Behavioural Ecology and Ecophysiology (BECO) Group, which has developed methods to manipulate ALAN inside boxes, and has high-quality publications on how ALAN affects sleep behaviour.  She will receive expert training on implanting neurologgers from Prof. A. Vyssotski (University of Zurich), and training on interpreting EEG data from Dr. N. Rattenborg’s Avian Sleep Research Group (Max Planck Institute).  She will contribute expert knowledge of urban ecology, stress physiology and bird handling, and introduce neurologgers to the BECO Group, facilitating a major advance in research methodology.  Results will be disseminated through top-tier publications, international conferences and public engagement, and used to advance scientific knowledge and motivate environmental policy changes.

In this project we propose to perform inelastic neutron scattering measurements down to ultralow temperatures and under high pressure in order to study the magnetic interactions of a number of characteristic HF compounds with different groundstates and liquid 3He. The measurements will be performed at the cooperative research group of the Institute Laue Langevin (ILL) and the nuclear centre (CENG) in Grenoble.",0,0
519,106461,Yes,The Economics of Mass Migration: Theory and Evidence,"The proposed research develops and tests models of individual behavior to provide evidence on the magnitude, causes and consequences of the mass migration between Europe and the US that occurred at the turn of the twentieth century. Underlying the project is the availability of electronic administrative records for 24 million migrants who arrived in the US via Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924, that we have obtained access to. Our earlier work using this data [Bandiera et al. 2011] shows that migration at the turn of the twentieth century was effectively a two-way flow between the US and Europe, rather than a one-way movement from Europe to the US. This insight is what the proposed research agenda seeks to build on.  The proposed project will develop and apply economic theory and micro-econometric methods related to core questions in the economics of migration. Our proposal will provide theory and evidence on four broad research themes: (i) the determinants of temporary versus permanent migration, and consequently how each type of migrant is differentially selected; (ii) the behavior and socio-economic outcomes of migrants who endogenously chose to remain in the US; (iii) the impact of mass migration on the labor market outcomes of Americans; (iv) whether institutional change in the US was driven by the nature of selective migration into America and where migrants chose to settle. In consequence, and to return full circle to the original insight from Bandiera et al. [2011] that underlies this research proposal, we ask whether migrants that returned to Europe from the US drove institutional change across European countries at the turn of the twentieth century.",0,1
1158,8908,No,Programming Environment for Applications of Parallel Genetic Algorithms,"Genetic algorithms in general, and parallel genetic algorithms in particular, are of major importance in the development of the new generation of IT applications. The potential which parallel genetic algorithms offer over existing information processing techniques is enormous. Genetic algorithms are ideally suited to the processing, classification and control of large-volume and varied data.   The PAPAGENA project aims to demonstrate applications and develop a programming environment for parallel genetic algorithms. The applications will underscore the usefulness of genetic algorithms in the European industry, while the programming environment work aims to establish a European standard.  The environment, called GAME (Genetic Algorithm Manipulation Environment), under development at present, provides a general-purpose toolkit for the programming and simulation of a wide range of genetic algorithm applications. It comprises a library of common genetic algorithms and a powerful graphical interface. In addition, the project exploits the intrinsic parallelism of genetic algorithms and will develop a compiling and mapping system for users of European high-performance supercomputers (particularly transputer-based systems) and future architectures to be provided by OMI (the Open Microprocessor Systems Initiative).   The target application areas for the demonstrators will be:   - protein folding, where the aim is to develop a method for calculating optimal polypeptide conformations by combining force-field energy calculations (based on semi-empirical parameters) with parallel genetic algorithms  - financial modelling, where a credit marketing and risk assessment decision-support tool will be developed - economic modelling, where a model for predicting industrial site clustering in Brandenburg has been developed.   To advance the application of genetic algorithm technology, a Genetic Algorithm European Economic Interest Group (EEIG) is in the process of being formed, comprising leading companies from across Europe. By allowing leading companies to monitor the building of genetic algorithm applications in PAPAGENA and giving them early access to the GAME programming environment, the consortium hopes to encourage the rapid take-up of the technology.",0,0

287,212342,No,Subwavelength Nanostructure Pilot (Sun-Pilot),"Nanostructured surfaces that engineer the interaction between an object and its surroundings are a subject of scientific and manufacturing importance. Nature routinely creates nanostructured surfaces with fascinating properties, such as antireflective moth eyes, self-cleaning lotus leaves, colourful butterfly wings, and water harvesting desert beetles. Well defined nanostructured surfaces have huge commercial potential due to product enhancement: reduced reflectivity in photonic devices and solar panels, antiglare plastic parts for the automotive industry, hydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces for smart packaging, antireflective and smudge-free smartphone displays, and biofouling resistant marine and water treatment systems. Unfortunately, the lack of cost-effective, scalable, nanopatterning methods is a major hurdle for the commercial exploitation of nanopatterned surfaces. SUN-PILOT will address this challenge by developing a novel and cost effective platform for up-scaling sub-wavelength nanostructures fabrication techniques that can be applied to curved surfaces such as optical lenses, and the mass production of metal moulds for injection moulding of plastic parts. The expected impact of SUN-PILOT for the Optics Industry is a disruptive technology that will boost the performance/cost ratio of photonic devices by piloting mass fabrication of scratch and wear resistant nanopatterned antireflective optical surfaces. Significant enhancement will be achieved in the efficiency of optical components and systems incorporating these devices, such as laser systems, electronic displays, security cameras and medical devices. The Automotive Industry will benefit from a novel method to produce functional surfaces at lower cost and lighter weight than existing lamination methods.

The first aim and principal focus of the research is therefore investigating planning and housing activities in three cities (Copenhagen, Lisbon and London) that seek to address problems of housing shortage, affordability, and segregation of housing tenures. The research aims to provide practical knowledge and innovative advice to decision-makers on what can be done regarding these huge societal challenges. The second aim of the research, underpinning and informing the former, is to make a contribution to the theoretical and methodological advancement of international comparative research on housing and land-use planning. In order to meet these aims, the theoretical and methodological skills of the candidate will be strengthened at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, located within the Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge, and led by Professor Michael Oxley. With over 25 years of experience and a proven track record of providing evidence and analysis to influence and support better policy and practice in several areas, the Centre is well-placed to broaden her practical experience of housing and planning matters, from both an interdisciplinary and a comparative perspective.

541,105699,Yes,Control and Optimisation for Energy Positive Neighbourhoods,"Buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of EU CO2 emissions, whilst the transportation sector is responsible for about 30% of the EU CO2 emissions. Achieving energy performance of neighbourhoods, including buildings, transportation systems and other supporting systems, is key to achieving the EU Climate & Energy objectives, namely a reduction of 20% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2020 and a 20% energy savings in primary energy use by 2020. These challenging environmental targets can be met only by a mix of energy-saving and energy-efficiency measures, together with other relevant actions achieved through research and innovation. Improving the energy consumption and holistic performance of buildings and neighbourhood systems is a cost-effective way of fighting against climate change and improving energy security, while also creating new markets and new job opportunities, particularly in the building sector. COOPERATE will develop an open, scalable neighbourhood service and management platform that integrates local monitoring and control functions with a cloud based service platform for the delivery of innovative energy management, security and other services in order to progress towards energy positive neighbourhoods and achieving 2020 targets. COOPERATE will carry out a substantial validation of the concepts in two validation sites, the Bouygues Challenger campus and the CIT Bishopstown campus. In doing so, COOPERATE addresses the challenges of the call by developing management and control systems, and decision-support systems addressing the dynamics of energy supply and demand in neighbourhoods. COOPERATE will optimise the use of energy beyond the buildings, includes the integration of renewable energy sources and the connection to the electricity distribution grid, and will consider appropriate business models.",1,1
624,207162,Yes,Large Surface Heating and Cooling Element,"More than 15% of CO2 emissions in Europe result from space heatings in buildings. An energy-efficient heat and cold supply on the basis of renewable energy is one of the greatest challenges for our society. The use of geothermal energy or solar thermal energy is a good solution for energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Both technologies could not yet establish well on the market because of the lack of inexpensive and efficient low-temperature heating systems (flow temperature 20-30°C). Established underfloor heatings are very expensive and only installed in new buildings. Therefore the market is looking for new and innovative renewable solutions, especially for the renovation. In order to meet this demand we have developed a new surface heating and cooling element (FHKE/TRL6). Objective of the SME Phase 1 project is the implementation of a feasibility study. The new developed heating and cooling panel shall enable a large scale application of low-temperature heating systems. Our element is characterized by the following advantages and therefore perfectly fits the requirements of our target customers (e.g. municipal companies, public estate administration offices, private owners of houses): -reduced heating costs by at least 20%  -low costs per m² -rapid mounting -nearly no dust or dirt at renovation  -small mass – easy handling, low transport costs -efficient and even heat distribution The current market volume for low-temperature heating system amounts to 500 – 1,000 million Euros. On the basis of imputed assumptions that within the next 15 years about 50% of the nearly 218 million European households need to be energetically redeveloped, this amounts to a market potential of at least 100 billion Euros related to sales. The project „Large enHANCEMENT“ is an integral part of the company’s strategy of Freitec and will lead to significant increase in turnover and employees and in the long-term to a CO2 reduced heat supply in Europe and worldwide.",1,1
657,89638,Yes,Resource- and Cost-effective integration of renewables in existing high-rise buildings,"The use of renewable energy in the building sector is today dominated by the application of solar domestic hot water and PV systems in single-family houses. In order to significantly increase the use of renewable energy in the building sector, concepts have to be developed for large buildings. In these buildings high fractions of the energy demand can only be met with renewable energy sources, when the façade is used for energy conversion in addition to the roof. This is especially true for buildings with a small roof area compared to the floor area (“high-rise buildings”) and for existing buildings which generally have a higher energy demand than new buildings. Therefore the main focus of the project is to convert facades of existing “high-rise buildings” into multifunctional, energy gaining components. This goal will be achieved through the - development of new multi-functional façade components which combine standard features and the use of renewable energy resources and the - development of new business and cost models which consider the whole life cycle of a building and which incorporate the benefits from reduced running costs and greenhouse-gas emissions. The new components will in particular profit from the application of nano-structured coatings and films which will enhance their performance and durability due to antireflective, anti-soiling and seasonal shading functionality. In order to achieve a successful development and implementation of these new technologies and concepts European key actors from construction industry and energy research have agreed to collaborate within this project. The project results will be an important support for the European technology platforms ECTP, ESTTP and PV-platform in which the project partners have a leading role.",0,1

Recent studies show that rather than being a simple spatiotemporal filter that encodes visual information, the retina performs sophisticated non-linear computations extracting specific spatio-temporal stimulus features in a highly selective manner (e.g. motion selectivity). Understanding the neurobiological principles beyond retinal functionality is essential to develop successful artificial computer vision architectures.RENVISION's goal is, therefore, twofold: i) to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how the retina encodes visual information through the different cellular layers; ii) to use such insights to develop a retina-inspired computational approach to high-level computer vision tasks.<br/>To this aim, exploiting the recent advances in high-resolution light microscopy 3D imaging and high-density multielectrode array technologies, RENVISION will be in an unprecedented position to investigate pan-retinal signal processing at high spatio-temporal resolution, integrating these two technologies in a novel experimental setup. This will allow for  simultaneous recording from the entire population of ganglion cells and functional imaging of inner retinal layers at near-cellular resolution, combined with 3D structural imaging of the whole inner retina. The combined analysis of these complex datasets will require the development of novel multimodal analysis methods.<br/>Resting on these neuroscientific and computational grounds, RENVISION will generate new knowledge on retinal processing. It will provide advanced pattern recognition and machine learning technologies to ICTs by shedding a new light on how the output of retinal processing (natural or modelled) allows solving complex vision tasks such as automated scene categorization and human action recognition.",0,0

673,226994,No,An Investigation into the viability of employing lipoaspirate fluid as a cellular source in the production of small diameter tissue engineered vascular grafts,"Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) hold great promise in the field of regenerative medicine and also possess the true potential to revolutionise the way in which clinicians treat the growing burden of cardiovascular disease. Treatment is achieved by incorporating an appropriate cell source onto a biodegradable scaffold and implanting the graft to bypass non-patent vascular segments. However, numerous issues regarding TEVG cell source render the technique unviable in a clinical setting as the cells require high levels of manipulation including digestion, isolation and culture. These issues increase processing costs, decrease cell stability and raise numerous regulatory issues. The use of minimally manipulated liposuction aspirate fluid (LAF) may offer a safer and more efficient cellular source in regenerative TEVGs. However, the capacity of LAF to act as a viable cell source for TEVGs is untested. The aim of this pr oject is to determine the capacity of LAF derived cells to act as a viable cell source for TEVGs. This will be achieved through characterisation of the LAF cells, investigation of the environment that best promotes favourable cellular behaviour, an in vivo study on the viability of the graft to act as a vascular interposition in a small animal model, scaling of the graft to appropriate human size and finally an in vivo study of the grafts ability to function as a vascular bypass in a large animal model.

587,186984,Yes,Planning for energy efficient cities,"Today climate change causes serious problems to the societies worldwide and Europe starts to feel its consequences. At the same time European community is facing economical problems. One of the main producers of greenhouse gases is the non sustainable energy production and use. Therefore there is an urgent need to reduce energy use in most cost effective way.  PLEEC will gather cities with innovative planning and ambitious energy saving goals. It will identify technology, citizens’ behaviors and structure driven efficiency potentials within urban planning and key city aspects. PLEEC will assess the status of energy efficiency and energy flows in the participating European middle size cities. It will improve understanding of basic conditions for energy efficiency in the cities through joint activities between city planners and researchers on technology, citizens’ behavior and structures. By finding the optimal mix of all energy efficiency measures the model for strategic sustainable planning will be created together with the action plans for implementation and management. The model and the action plans will address key aspects relevant for the whole city. They will be supported by the public authorities on the highest political levels. Analysis of time line, the costs and pay-back periods will be done based on different regulatory and market conditions of the participating cities. The model will guide the cities to find the most cost effective implementation of the EU SET-Plan goals to reduce energy use in EU by 20% till 2020.",1,1
437,212231,Yes,Plume Air Cloud – Air Quality Data Crowdsourcing Platform for Environmentally-friendly Cities,"'Air pollution is the leading avoidable cause of death according to the WHO and a major mobility and smart cities challenge for Europe, causing 600,000 premature deaths in the EU every year. The magnitude of this challenge is exacerbated by the dearth of reliable and readily available data on exposure to pollution: Member States' air pollution monitoring infrastructures, comprising of networks of sparse stations who fail to adequately cover the continent, 'often render the data inaccurate and could thus create a public health risk' according to the European Parliament.  The Plume Air Cloud is an Internet of Things and data platform for live air pollution exposure forecast which aims at helping consumers track and reduce the impact of air quality on their health and well-being, and supporting policymakers in promoting smarter mobility choices to build cleaner cities.

960,80631,No,Pervasive ultra-wideband low spectral energy radio systems phase II,"The key objective of PULSERS Phase II is to continue exploration of the enormous potential of the innovative and disruptive radio technology embodied in UWB and to enable introduction of new services, applications and devices based on this technology. Progress at the frontier of technology in the technical project work will be accompanied by continuation of ongoing PULSERS activities in the European and global regulation and standardisation bodies.  The goal is to facilitate a globally compatible regulatory framework for UWB applications. Besides wireless short range communications with data rates ranging from kilobit per second (robust - low cost - low complexity - low power) up to gigabit per second (high performance - low power), UWB technology enables precise real-time location tracking inherently due to its unique feature of ultra-wide radio frequency band allocation. Widespread application of this new wireless technology will facilitate growth of a number of new market segments -all different, but all enabled by the unique features of UWB radio being highly scalable with regard to complexity, range, costs and data rate as well as location precision accuracy.  PULSERS Phase II, an industry-led initiative of 36 major industrial and academic organisations, will continue and extend the successful work carried out in Phase 1. The approach to be taken in Phase II is to consolidate and refine the system concepts developed, to place the technologies developed into the context of the system concepts, and to develop comprehensive verification platforms for these concepts. In particular, these results will materialize in five specific hardware platforms, each enabling verification of advanced short-range communication, and of innovative real time location and tracking system concepts.  The project will devote significant efforts to participation in IEEE, CEPT, ITU and ETSI working to support consensus building in the European and worldwide UWB regulation/standardisation.",0,0
481,75810,Yes,SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION OF UNDERGROUND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURES,"Cut and cover tunnels are a vital tool for the construction of transport infrastructures which are needed for the development of the Trans European Transport Network. This method is widely used for the construction of road/railways tunnels, but it must now satisfy a new set of requirements: urgent need for safer and more cost effective techniques and reduction of environmental impact of the construction (use of natural resources, noise, disruption of traffic, etc). The SCOUT project introduces a breakthrough for the construction of cut-and-cover tunnels, which is characterised by a holistic approach: -Implementation of the Observational Method for a full control of construction and delays, -Optimisation of the design, based on the central concept of double-skin structure, -A radically new construction concept of equipment, with a modular architecture to be used in a large variety of tunnel configurations and soil profiles, -Development and testing of new applications of composites materials to optimise the efficiency of the structure, -Establishing a roadmap towards the recycling of excavated materials. The project is driven by industrial partners, and will include the construction of a pilot wall to validate the construction concept and the execution of full scale tests on composite structure members . Project results will decrease construction costs by more than 30% and production lead times by 30%, and will therefore open new perspectives for the construction of cut-and-cover tunnels to create or upgrade new transport infrastructures. They will include: -Recommendations guides for the optimisation of cut-and-cover projects, -Guide for the implementation of the Observational Method; -A breakthrough concept of drilling equipment for the construction of cut-and-cover tunnels, -New concepts for composite cut-and-cover structure members.",0,1
369,92589,No,DEmonstration of LIdar based Clear Air Turbulence detection,"Atmospheric turbulence encounters are the leading cause of injuries to passengers and crews in non-fatal airline accident. The number of turbulence accidents has been growing by a factor of 5 since 1980. A whole class of turbulence (Clear Air Turbulence), representing 40% of turbulence accidents, cannot be detected by any existing equipment including state-of-the-art weather radar. Operational concepts for the protection against turbulence hazard, based on a UV LIDAR, are: - Short-range measurement of air speed ahead of the aircraft and action on the flight controls, - Medium-range detection of turbulence, and securing of passengers by seat belts fasten. The short-range concept has been validated in the frame of the FP5 AWIATOR project. The objective of DELICAT is to validate the medium range turbulence detection (based on backscattered energy fluctuations). In development phase, both short and medium range will be integrated in single equipment. The validation of medium range turbulence detection is based on the comparison of LIDAR data and aircraft sensors data. - A UV LIDAR mock up is designed, manufactured and flight-tested, - The LIDAR data and the aircraft sensors data are compared off line for the same atmosphere area. The consortium assembled for the DELICAT project includes all the expertise necessary to reach the objective, and will take advantage of previous projects such as FP5 AWIATOR and FP6 FLYSAFE. The project resources are globally adapted to the project ambitious objectives and innovation content. DELICAT takes advantage of existing hardware (laser sub assemblies, test aircraft fairing) to achieve the goal at lower possible cost. The DELICAT project will directly contribute to the objectives of the AAT.2008.3.3.2. topic by increasing customer safety; the objective is to reduce the number of turbulence accidents by 40%. Dissemination of DELICAT will be ensured by setting up a Web Site, and by gathering an External Experts Advisory Group.",0,0
990,39784,No,3D Localizer for Computer Assisted Surgery,"PARAXIM and GEMETEC propose development and industrialisation of an optical measurement system called a 3D localizer, specific to the domain of Computer Assisted Surgery CAS . The principal ails of this rapidly expanding new domain in medicine are to make surgical interventions more accurate, image-guided and less invasive. 3D localizers can measure position and orientation of objects in 3 dimensions at a high rate of speed and are a bvasic component in most CAS systems. They are used to localize and track surgical tools, 3D ponters intra-operative sensors and bone motion. Designign a 3D localizer which meets CAS requirements in terms of accuracy, sterilisation, reliability, number of objects which can be localised and that can also be used by different companies and hospitals for most CAS applciations at a reasonable price has not yet been accomplished. This is the goal of the LOCAS project. The technology selected is optoelectronics because thus far, it is the only one that can meet all the CAS requirements. In the first part of the project, a general system using active markers will be developed. The second part of the project will focus on development of passive markers. Since the tool to be developed is intended for widespread generalised use, much emphasis will be given to the medical specification. Another goal is to make both medical and technical specifications public at the end of the project so that they will serve to prepare European Standards for 3D CAS localizers.",0,0
1207,219727,No,"The unity of scattering amplitudes: gauge theory, gravity, strings and number theory","Scattering amplitudes are central observables in quantum field theory and provide essential information about the quantum consistency of perturbative gravity. Precise control of the physical and mathematical properties of scattering amplitudes holds the key to long-standing questions on fundamental interactions and the structure of space and time. As a concrete leap in this direction, UNISCAMP addresses predictions in gauge theories, gravity and effective theories through  - the efficient computation and compact representation of scattering amplitudes and, - decoding their hidden structures & symmetries and their rich web of connections.  String-theory methods will complement conventional approaches to scattering amplitudes, and I will combine the insights from  - the point-particle limit of superstrings & heterotic strings and, - the recent ambitwistor strings which directly compute field-theory amplitudes.  Both of them naturally incorporate the double-copy relation between gauge-theory & gravity amplitudes and extend the framework to effective field theories describing pions and other low-energy states. It is a primary goal of UNISCAMP to pinpoint the unifying principles connecting a wide range of field and string theories. My expertise in both flavours of string theories will allow to optimally exploit their fruitful synergies and to depart from mainstream approaches.   Moreover, field- and string-theory amplitudes exhibit an intriguing mathematical structure: Their Feynman- and moduli-space integrals yield special functions such as polylogarithms which became a vibrant common theme of high-energy physics and number theory. As an interdisciplinary goal of UNISCAMP, I will  - investigate the low-energy expansion of multiloop string amplitudes and, - extract an organizing scheme for iterated integrals on higher-genus Riemann surfaces.  These research objectives should benefit from my experience in collaborations with mathematicians.",0,0
152,99633,No,Land  Use  Processes  and  Urban  Sprawl,"'Urban sprawl is a remarkable socioeconomic phenomenon that continues to generate attention across Europe and beyond. In its broadest sense, urban sprawl may be defined as the spreading out of a city and its suburbs over increasingly large areas of rural land at the periphery of an urban area and the consequent conversion of open space into developed land.  The research project described in this proposal explores the economic processes under-pinning the phenomenon of urban sprawl. Its objective is to describe and explain urban spatial structure and its evolution. In particular, the project will investigate the role of the spatial distribution of environmental amenities in urban sprawl and the influence of future land development on agricultural land values.  The originality of this project is to consider urban sprawl as a simultaneous result of two mechanisms. On the one hand, are the effects of the behaviour of households and firms and the development patterns that they engender in peri-urban areas, while on the other hand is the influence of evolving land values and of  developing agricultural and land use policies. This project will consider the literatures on these mechanisms and seek to identify new approaches to understand and limit urban sprawl.'",1,0
