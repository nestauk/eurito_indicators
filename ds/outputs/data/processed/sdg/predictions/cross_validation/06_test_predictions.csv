372,227665,No,Manufacture of nanostructured Conjugated Porous Polymers for energy applications,"The world energy demand is continuously growing due to the increase of population. This has triggered the need of new technologies that allow the sustainability of the planet. In this sense, the search of novel materials that can be introduced in these new technological approaches is mandatory.   In NanoCPPs project, the design, synthesis and scale up of nanoparticles based on Conjugated Porous Polymers (CPPs)  will be performed.  Advanced techniques will be applied to obtain processable CPPs as colloidal solutions in the multi-gram scale as precursors to prepare thin films. These conductive polymer thin films will be used in photoelectrochemical devices for artificial photosynthesis processes, including hydrogen production from water and CO2 reduction. NanoCPPs will address the two main drawbacks inherent to the CPPs synthetic process currently used. Firstly, the particle size control will be improved, which allows to tune the photo(electro)physical properties, in the same way as it happens with nanoparticles based on inorganic semiconductors. Secondly, NanoCPPs will also advance towards the formulation of optimum colloidal solutions of nanostructured CPPs that offers new opportunities to their processability, which is an outstanding issue for this kind of materials.  The knowledge transfer plan will be based on a vendor IP strategy, in which target companies will be preferentially those dedicated to polymers manufacturing for advance applications and those dedicated to electrodes production at large scale. With this aim, a market and IP assessment as well as a pre-technology study will be performed in order to transfer NanoCPPs new technology to the market”.",0,0
259,80023,Yes,Incorporation of Aquaporins in Membranes for Industrial Applications,"In all living cells, channels transporting water - aquaporins - exist. They are proteins, which only transport pure H2O molecules. They have a unique selectivity and are extremely efficient being nature's own membrane systems. The purpose is to investigate whether these unique features can be industrially exploited: Recombinant aquaporin molecules will be embedded into water filtration membranes. Nano-biotechnological research of water transport in various organisms shows that aquaporins have 100% selectivity: Only water molecules pass. They also maintain high water permeation rates. Membrane technology is another rapidly developing technology within filtration and separation. Substantial research is done to enhance efficiency of membranes.  The MEMBAQ project combines these two research spearheads. This combination has never been done before. A new filtration membrane with aquaporins is in theory up to 50 times more efficient (energy input reduction). It is truly radical innovation of the water industries, for instance for water purification (billions of EUR is spent every year), salinity gradient energy production (exploitable potential is 2000TWh annually), waste water reclamation (water re-use).  The MEMBAQ project will: 1) produce recombinant aquaporin, 2) design nanotechnological membrane by means of computer simulation, 3) incorporate aquaporins into stable membranes, 4) engineer membranes based on characterising towards pressure, ph etc., 5) and finally test such membranes in three applications: Water purification, osmotic energy, and waste water reclamation for re-use. US and Japan invest significantly more per capita than EU in nanotechnology.  This gap is expected to widen in the next few years. In MEMBAQ, we use real market needs in the water sector as a driver for accelerated research and innovation in nanotechnology. Enormous potentials in filtering other fluids and gasses with natural proteins embedded in membranes exist.",1,1
814,227652,No,Evolutionary Consequences of Arrested Genomic Conflict in Asexual Species,"Genomic conflicts are major drivers of evolutionary innovation and play an increasingly recognized role in human disease. Intra-genomic conflicts arise because self-promoting elements such as driving centromeres or transposable elements (TEs) can spread in a population without increasing the fitness of their carriers. Inter-genomic conflicts arise when genes have opposite fitness effects in different carriers, as is the case for genes underlying traits with distinct optimal values in males and females. Here I propose to use asexual species as a novel system to studying intra- and inter-genomic conflicts. Because there is no recombination or segregation under asexual reproduction, intra-genomic conflict disappears as the interests of all genetic elements become aligned with those of their host. This allows us to test the predictions that intra-genomic conflict drives the evolution of TE virulence, centromeres, and centromere-binding proteins. Furthermore, because asexual species are comprised of only females, male phenotypes are no longer under selection and sexual conflict over optimal trait values therefore disappears. This proposal leverages the replicated loss of conflicts in independently evolved asexual lineages of Timema stick insects to identify conflict driven aspects of genomic and phenotypic evolution in sexual species. Because Timema have an XX:XO sex determination system, males can be recovered from asexual lineages via X-chromosome losses. This allows for the study of male reproductive traits, sexual dimorphism and sex-biased gene expression in species where selection has been acting solely on females for prolonged time periods, and for the identification of traits and biological processes subject to sexual conflict. By combining phenotypic, experimental and next-generation sequencing approaches, we will generate a cohesive understanding of how intra- and inter-genomic conflict shape phenotype and genome evolution.",0,0

745,51806,No,Complex anti-corrosion coatings using bacterial cells,"Biologically based manufacturing could contribute significantly to the development of an energy-efficient anti-corrosion coating deposition treatment on metal substrates. The today's conventional galvanic processes are only 40-50% efficient. The main reason is the low metal complex load capacity (milk) of the galvanic bath. It is known from the biotechnology processing that bioreactors including cell factories are very efficient in both product output and in energy consumption. From metal complex waste and treatment by cell factories high yields-yields are already used. Consequently metabolic processes could have far more metal complex load capacity, which is an opportunity for this industrial process. In principle, biological containment of live bacterial cell is far more accurate because of the ease of control of the surface reactions. The aim of the project is to develop a continues bioreactor process in which the metal substrates will be treated with a metal-complex, deposit by Genetically Engineered Micro-organism (Gems). The substrate is running in a safety, closed system. Nonliving cells will be coming out of the after treatment step and the metal-complex will be properly cured.",0,0

434,46932,No,An Integrated Fruit Processing and Preservation System for SME Mate rial and Equipment Manufacturers,"The consumption patterns of fresh fruit over the past century have been dependent on the availability of methods to ensure that the product reaches the consumer in peak condition. The traditional method for delivery of fruit has been to harvest when under ripe and to try to control the ripening process during the transport phase. The fruit is then delivered and sold whole. However, the demand for fresh cut fruit, which is ready peeled, cored and segmented has soared in the past ten years, led by demand for convenient, natural, high added value foods from affluent consumers and a market aware catering industry. There are approximately 1100 SMEs in the EU who manufacture additive materials and equipment for fruit processing companies. In common with most other SME equipment manufacturers, within the sector, we currently produce equipment designed to take the target fruit whole, to perform a single operation such as skinning or juice extraction. However, we have identified a market opportunity for a novel, integrated processing and preservation system, with which fresh cut fruit may be prepared at the point of harvest, preserved and maintained in a high quality form for the long enough to transport it to the final processor and vendor. Since the production of fruit is both localized and highly seasonal, leading to the requirement for a substantial amount of storage and transportation, there is a tremendous amount of waste associated with the commercial transportation and processing of fruit. Over 280 million Tonnes per annum, of fruit is shipped around the Globe, with EU demand accounting for 28% of that total. Industry estimates are that nearly 40% of the volume of fruit purchased and delivered to processors, from the grower, is discarded for the following reasons: - Unwanted peel and stones stripped from the processed fruit. Unprocessable, Category 2 fruit, that are cosmetically defective. - Unprocessable, degraded fruit. Currently, fruit preparation at the point of harvest is only used for low value destructive processes, such as jam making or canning, since the removal of the fruit's natural protective coating, its skin, initiates and accelerates the decay processes, rendering it impossible to transport in this state. Thus it is not currently possible to prepare fresh cut products at the grower's site for subsequent transportation, to realise substantial cost savings. If peeling, coring and segmenting could be performed at point of harvest, and product transported without significant degradation, the community of 140 SME fruit processors, like Orchard house Foods, could save up to 50 ECU / tonne or a total of 2.5MECU/pa in transport and process waste costs alone. In addition, the 2000 SME fruit growers, in the Union would also be given the rare opportunity to add value to their products, by offering part processed products, boosting their existing sales of 30 Bn ECU/pa, by around 10%. Likewise, processing materials and equipment suppliers would be provided with an entirely new application market for our systems, worth an estimated 2 MECU/pa. As the market for fresh cut fruit continues to grow at over 25% per year, both the European growers and processors risk losing market share as competitors, from outside the EU, continue to develop methods of extending fruit life under protracted transport conditions. Our proposed research is in response to the urgent industrial need to develop a European process solution to provide a method by which fruit growers can part process and protect fruit products from the decay mechanisms that occur within the transit and storage process. By this means they can generate transport cost savings, add value to their products and develop higher quality product offerings to further stimulate this buoyant market.",0,0
201,34240,Yes,A new integrated geophysical approach for the rational management and exploration of groundwater resources,"The main objectives are as follows:  The development and testing of a flexible, high resolution, integrated geophysical work package which can be used for the solution of water exploration or management problems in complex hydrogeological settings such as are found in the Mediterranean coastal region.   In practical terms this means establishing improved methods of sitting productive boreholes, thereby reducing exploration costs for new groundwater reserves, and to research the capabilities of non-invasive methods for monitoring and managing 'at risk' aquifers of the Mediterranean. The applicability of the results will also be tested at a number of sites within the EU. Expected Outcome  The work carried out in this project will lead to improved combinations of innovative geophysical techniques for application in deep aquifers in the Mediterranean region. This evaluation will also lead to a more cost effective approach to water exploration and management studies, by enabling the identification of deeply located water supplies by non-invasive technology, instead of traditional drilling techniques. The key activities are to be performed in Cyprus and Israel.  The hydrogeological problem to be addressed on Cyprus is water exploration, and will include: * reliable and detailed mapping of various types of aquifers (sediments/crystalline basement) * geophysical exploration, using a combination of NMR, EKS, AMT, AAR and other sophisticated techniques * evaluation of water quality by ICP-MS and other analyses.  The hydrogeological problem to be addressed in Israel is water resource management, and will include: * problems of salinization, contamination, overpumping, which will be evaluated to enable a more efficient management. * geophysical exploration to provide a better knowledge of the inner structure of the aquifers, using NMR, EKS, TDEM, AMT, AAR and other techniques  For both areas there will be a detailed evaluation of the economic feasibility.",1,1
955,80178,No,Innovative collaborative work environments for individuals and teams in design and engineering,"The overall objective of CoSpaces is to develop organisational models and distributed technologies supporting innovative collaborative workspaces for individuals and project teams within distributed virtual manufacturing enterprises to establish effective partnerships, collaborate, be creative, improve productivity, reduce length of design cycles and take a holistic approach to implementing product phases. This will be achieved through enhanced human communication, innovative visualisation, knowledge support and natural interaction and will transform the current working practices to be more competitive in the global market. CoSpaces proposes to validate these collaborative workspaces against three sectors: aerospace, automotive and construction. However, the impact of this research will go beyond these three sectors due to the generic nature of the technologies. CoSpaces will undertake the ambitious challenge of developing the technical, organisational and human networks to build collaborative workspaces. This will be achieved through a systematic and integrated programme of RTD activities, dissemination, training, demonstration and exploitation activities, led by a core consortium of European experts who are committed to this mission.  CoSpaces IP focuses on implementing the roadmap developed by the Future_Workspaces roadmap project, involving over 100 key players from large number of areas. As a result of this roadmap activity, this consortium has already defined a 10-year European Vision for future collaborative working environments together with future scenarios, research challenges and key players for implementing this roadmap. The aim of this IP is to initiate a programme of activities to implement this 10 year European vision to the benefit of European business, workforce, society and the ERA with a selection of the identified key players.

The objective will be pursued according to two strictly related aspects: 1)produce artistic works based on scientific phenomena at a professional level; 2)stimulate students of EC schools to produce their own works and to organize an international competition to prize the best ones. (We consider this a form of very deep and long lasting interactive action that we prefer to the sometimes superficial and ephemeral interactive processes available in some popularization science exhibitions). Practically we intend to realize artistic events based on scientific issues per each of the following artistic disciplines: 1)Modern dance 2)Cinema 3)Contemporary art 4)Imaging 5)Literature The produced art work will be exploited in a double way: a)By presenting them in live events in the different countries involved in the project addressing not only the targeted category of persons (high school students (15-18 years), but also the general public; b)By organizing a competition among the EU high school students for each of the 5 considered discipline (with a consequent interactive process involving potentially thousands of students).

350,22603,No,Improved coatings on metals using fluidized bed thermochemical treatments,"In the present project it is intended to develop novel multi-element diffusion coatings resistant to different aggressive environments at high temperatures using fluidized bed and plasma fluidized bed technology, and also to develop the tools and procedures for predicting and evaluating the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters that control multi-element diffusion treatments. The thermochemical/thermodynamic calculation using the CHEMSAGE software package indicated that by using the appropriate reacting substances Cr/Al and small amounts of rare earth elements, Hf and to a very minor extent Yt, can be deposited on Fe and Ni alloys.  For the hard coatings TiN and TiB2 also appear to be feasible under certain conditions of temperature and reacting substances.  Two reactors, a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) and a plasma fluidized bed reactor (PFBR) and all the auxiliary units for their operation and control were designed and constructed.   Using the two reactors and by varying the temperature, time and the chemical reactants fed in the reactors, the following coatings were obtained.   In the FBR:  - A CrAlYt coating of approximately 150 µm thickness on Fe alloy  - A Cr(Hf) carbide coating of approximately 25 µm thickness on tool steel.   The high temperature CrAlYt coating and the Cr(Hf) carbide hard coating were of acceptable thickness, showed very good adhesion and uniformity and satisfactory properties.  A Fe alloy with the CrAlYt coating showed improved thermal fatigue properties and the Cr(Hf) carbide layer showed Vickers microhardness values in the range of 1531 - 1921. Both these layers could be of commercial interest as they are easy to obtain in the FBR.   In the PFBR  Ti and N elements were deposited on steel substrate. This method did not lead to the formation of continuous layer and certain measures are proposed in order to achieve this objective. The numerical Model developed is operational and can be applied to Plasma spouted bed reactor. In fluidization, a bed of finally divided particles is made to behave like a liquid by a moving gas fed upwards through the bed.  This technique is cost effective easily controlled and flexible enough and allows to obtain improved multi-element diffusion coatings resistant to aggressive environments.   The new powerful computer package ChemSage will be used to analyse and predict the complex equilibrium phenomena taking place during diffusion treatments, so as to optimise the simultaneous diffusion of elements such as : B, C, N, with Ti and Hf and Al, Cr, with Yt, La, Ce.   The substrate materials will be Fe and Ni alloys.

757,96071,No,Capacitive mixing as a novel principle for generation of clean renewable energy from salinity differences,"Electricity can be generated by mixing salt water and fresh water in a controlled way. Salt water can be sea water and fresh water can be river water, so this technology can be used wherever a river flows into the sea. CAPMIX stands for capacitive mixing and is a new way of harvesting this potential power. The principal advantage of this technology is that the electricity generation is directly linked to the mixing process, no additional intermediate conversions are necessary. There is thus no need for expensive complex converters like turbines or electrodes. This makes that this type of holds the greatest promise of becoming an economical and environmental benign renewable energy plant.",1,0
821,1726,No,Measurement of transformation of C3H 1OT 1/2 cells by low doses of ionizing radiation,"The principal risk from low doses of ionizing radiation is the induction of cancer. At present, determination of the risks of developing specific types of cancer are based on predictions made by methods which have not been validated at occupational radiation doses. At such low doses the use of animal models to study dose response relationships for cancer becomes prohibitively expensive. Cell transformation in vitro offers an alternative approach, however only one system, the C3H 10T1/2 assay, provides the relatively high precision required for measurements at low doses.   Even with this assay the sensitivity is low, consequently a collaborative effort involving several laboratories is necessary to measure effects at 10 mGy. A joint venture between AEA, Harwell; GSF, Frankfurt; Nuclear Electric, Berkeley and the Universities of Milan and Wurzburg has been established to carry out such a programme with the following objectives:  to standardize the C3H 10T1/2 cell transformation assay between European laboratories to ensure comparability of results;  to establish the shape of the doseAresponse relationships for survival and transformation of 10T1/2 cells exposed to a range of radiation qualities down to 10 mGy.  Comparison had been made between cell surface proteins from normal C3H/10T1/2 cells and those transformed by either cobalt-60 gamma rays or the chemical carcinogen 3-methylcholantherene (MCA). Membrance proteins from both normal and transformed cells were then analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This led to the detection of consistent differences in membrane protein expression between the normal and transformed cells and in particular the identification of 4 proteins of special interest. These were of approximate molecular weight: 66, 49, 44 and 37 kD, the first of which showed greatest expression in the normal cells and was progressively lost in the transformed cells, whilst the reverse is true of the other 3.  Monoclonal antibodies have been produced against the 4 proteins of interest and commenced by isolating them from the SDS-PAGE gels by electroelution.  Monoclonal antibodies were then raised against a mixture of the 4 proteins using in vitro immunization techniques. By this approach 15 positive clones were identified, all of which were immunglobulin M (IgM) immunoglobulin isotype.  The fine specificity of these 15 monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, even by flow cytometry, only slight differences in antibody reactivity could be detected between normal and transformed cells, whilst the Western blotting indicated that the binding was nonspecific as the antibodies bound to multiple protein bands.  These combined results suggest that the antibodies react with epitopes common to a variety of cell surface proteins rather than to those which are transformation related, thus showing little difference in reactivity between the normal and transformed cells. Continuing work will investigate this problem and attempt to generate antibodies of the desired specificity.  With respect to the standardization of the C3H 10T1/2 transformation assay, cells were prepared for the standardization exercises for the 5 Gy intercomparison. The inverse dose rate effect using 2.2 MeV neutrons was studied and a direct comparison was made of the effect of protons and alpha-particles with the same linear energy transfer (LET).  The intercomparison experiments involved the detection of single transform cells using cell surface markers.  An intensive series of measurements involving the scoring of about 100 foci has shown the possibility of a small enhancement in the effectiveness of low dose rates of 2.2 MeV neutrons. The dose chosen for this comparison was 0.2 Gy given either acutely or over a period of 5 h. It was found that the transformation frequency at the low dose rate was 1.3 times higher than at the high dose rate (95% confidence limits \/-0.27).  In another series of collaborative experiments 10T1/2 cells were irradiated with either 0.5, 1 or 2 Gy of protons and alpha-particles with LET's between 20 and 23 keV um{-1}. No significant difference in the transformation frequencies were seen for other endpoints.  In a comparative investigation the transformation rates of C3H 10T1/2 cells after exposure to chromium K alpha X-rays (5.4 keV) and cobalt-60-gamma rays have been determined. Soft X-rays are more effective than gamma for cell transformation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value for soft X-rays versus gamma-rays was approximately 1.3 in the range of soft X-ray doses from 2 Gy to 5 Gy. There was no recognizable dependence of the RBE on dose, which contrasts the findings with alpha particles. The essential result of this soft X-ray study is that electrons of low energy and of ranges less than 1 um are more effective than fast electrons, not only for cell inactivation but also for cell transformation.  Induction of transformation incidence was examined in C3H 10T1/2 cells after exposure to single and fractionated doses of intermediate and high linear energy transfer (LET) particles, in order to investigate the possible LET dependence of an inversed dose rate effect for cell transformation. Accelerated particles from the RARAF (Columbia University, New York) have been used to expose the cells to a single dose or 3 fractions with different time intervals between the fractions. Doses were chosen leading to surviving fractions of 0.6 to 0.7. The transformation frequency was influenced by extended exposure time for some but not all radiation qualities. Enhancement of transformation was evident for 40, 75, and 120 keV/um when the time between each fraction was greater than 15 min. As LET increases above 25 keV/um, the differences in transformation induction between acute and extended exposures increase to a maximum at 120 keV/um before disappearing at 200 keV/um. Further experiments with helium-4 ions (LET 150 keV/um) and with americium-alpha-particles (LET 147 keV/um) are underway to complete the data. The variation in enhancement with long intervals between fractionation appears to be consistent with a proposed mechanism in which a period of extra sensitivit y exists in the cell cycle (Rossi and Kellerer, 1986)  Research was carried out in order to evaluate parameters which affect the transformation frequency on C3H 10T1/2 cells and techniques were developed for the exposure to C3H 10T1/2 cells to characteristic ultrasoft X-rays. Because of the extremely low range of CK characteristic X-rays special glass dishes with hostaphane foils were used. The glass dishes were made from glass cylinders and hostaphane was stretched across one side of the glass dish and glued to the dish. In order to avoid cells that may be shielded by an excess of glue or by attachment to the glass wall of the dish, a special device was constructed which produces first a ring of puremedium near the wall. Then 0.4 ml of cell suspension was distributed within this ring. After 5 h incubation, when cells are attached to the foil, 1.6 ml of medium was added and the incubation continued for another 48 h. The cell count at this time was about 1.2 E5 and cells were still in exponential growth phase when exposed to the ultrasoft X-rays.  The CK photon beam was vertical and photons entered through the bottom of the glass dish, through the hostaphane foil. The dishes were placed in a holder with the hostaphane foil facing the photon beam. Dosimetry was performed using a special ionization chamber. The dose measurements corresponded to the entrance dose, ie the dose in cells just behind the 1.5 um hostaphane foil. The dose rate amounts to about 5 Gy min{-1}.  For quantitation of cell transformation it was necessary to measure cell survival as a function of dose. C3H 10T1/2 cells attached to the hostphane foil are very flat. The mean thickness of the cell nucleus amounted to about 2 um so that the average dose to the cell nucleus relative to the entrance dose was found to be 0.55. Survivial curves were drawn of C3H 10T1/2 cells after exposure to cobalt-60 gamma rays (reference radiation) and CK photons. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of the CK photons relative to cobalt-60 gamma rays for va rious survival levels of C3H 10T1/2 cells were calculated. The RBE values were dose dependant, mainly due to the less pronounced shoulder in the survival curve obtained after CK photon exposure.  Transformation and inactivation frequencies induced in 10T1/2 cells exposed to 4.3 MeV alpha particles were determined in the range interval between 0.2 and 300 cGy. Survival data are well fitted by an exponential function of the dose with a mean lethal dose value of 0.61\/-0.02 Gy. Transformation frequencies per surviving cell versus dose were calculated. The initial cell density was kept to between 2 and 4 cells/cm{2}. The transformation curve shows a complex behaviour. For less than 0.02 Gy, data are well described by a staight line with an average slope of (8.5\/-2) E-3 Gy{-1}. In this dose region there is a negligible probability for a cell or its nucleus to be hit by 2 independent radiation tracks. Therefore a linear relationship between transformation frequency and dose was expected.  In the interval between 0.02 and 0.2 Gy there is an apparent constancy. This could be explained either by assuming an inducible repair process (in this dose interval the contribution of multiple traversals of the cells becomes significant), or, as due to the phenomena that occur at low doses and tend towards saturation. Such phenomena could be an alteration with its own probability of leading to transformation, or a period in the cell cycle during which the cells are especially sensitive. The analysis of the curve in the light of these models is in progress in the laboratory. Experiments on dose fractionation effect are underway. A total dose of 0.21 Gy was delivered either as a single fraction or as 3 equal fractions at time invervals of 1.5 h between the doses. In each experiment single and fractionated dose were delivered in parallel and with the same experimental conditions. Preliminary results show that transformation frequencies after fractionated exposure are higher than after single exposure by a factor of about 1.3. Initial discussions revealed several differences in the assay procedures used by the participating laboratories:   Comparative evaluation of scoring transformants.   As a first step towards harmonizing the assay procedures each laboratory contributed a selection of culture vessels containing transformed foci from previous experiments. The vessels were then circulated around the laboratories and each laboratory independently recorded the number of foci they considered to be transformed. A comparison between the scores revealed some differences but overall there was good agreement. On the basis of roundtable discussions the criteria for defining a transformed focus was further refined and the criteria for identifying transformants standardized between the participating laboratories.   Intercomparison of experimental protocols.   A comparison of the standard procedures used by the different labs showed some minor differences but it is not clear whether these affected the final  transformation frequency. At this stage, no attempt has been made to derive and impose a consensus standard procedure for the assay, However, certain additional steps have been taken to harmonize the technical procedures used by the different laboratories. In particular, the plating density of viable cells at the beginning of a transformation experiment has, initially, been set to 3 to 5 cellcm{A2}, and a common method of staining the monolayer at the end of the experiment has been adopted.   Multicentre measurement of transformation frequency.   In order to establish whether other differences in technique influence the outcome of a transformation experiment 10T1/2 cells irradiated at one laboratory will be shipped to the other participants who will then perform a transformation assay according to their normal procedures. Preliminary studies on the optimum method of shipping the cells, by the University of Wurzburg and Berkeley, revealed that they travelled best at 0 C in an ice-water mixture. Using this procedure, recovery was high and the plating efficiency was unaffected by 48 hours in transit. Freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by shipping on dry ice was unsatisfactory; recovery was poor and the plating efficiency was reduced by approximately 50%, irradiated and unirradiated cells being affected to the same extent.   Future objectives:   Having established the feasibility of shipping irradiated cells between the participants with no loss of viability 10T1/2 cells will be irradiated with 5 Grays at one centre and shipped to each participant along with appropriate controls. Each participant will initiate a transformation assay from the cells in parallel, with a transformation assay using their own cells as an internal control. The results will be reviewed and, if necessary, the experimental procedures revised to achieve greater uniformity. If the results are in reasonable agreement (ie no significant difference between the labs so the results can be pooled), the procedure will be repeated for a dose of 1 Gy and subsequently in steps to lower doses, the final target being 10 mGy.",0,0
1006,74141,No,Plants and their extracts and other natural alternatives to antimicrobials in feeds,"Growth-promoting antibiotics will be banned in the EU by 2006. Livestock producers need alternative means of obtaining similar production benefits to maintain profitability and competitiveness against overseas producers, including the US, where such restri ctions do not exist. Ways must also be found to improve the healthiness and safety of animal products reaching the consumer, including those from organic farming. This project will examine plants, plant extracts and other natural materials as safe alternat ives to feed antimicrobials. The materials will be derived from 500 samples of plant materials collected as possible feed additives for ruminants [FP5 project, Rumen-up, QLK5-CT-2001-00992], plus some additional natural materials likely to be useful in no n-ruminants. Rumen-up samples, for which a large data set of background information and screening success now exists, will be tested for properties not screened in FP5: their possible impact on human and animal health (E. coli, parasites), food quality (fa tty acids) and efficient use of natural resources (increased forage use by ruminants). Researchers on pigs, poultry and fish, where the impact of antibiotic withdrawal is greatest, will join the consortium. The priorities in these species overlap with rumi nants, although the precise aims and pathogen species are different. After identifying the most promising candidates for each target, a small number of samples will be taken to demonstration, proof-of- concept trials. The project will link fragmented res earch carried out with different animal species across Europe and provide a platform, via consultation with industry, farmers' and consumers' organisations, veterinarians, botanists, agronomists and economists, for the rational production of a new generati on of natural feed additives. The main benefits will be a healthier, safer food chain, increased sustainability of animal agriculture and reduction in its detrimental effects on the environment.'",0,0
389,188238,No,"Swimmers: one, few, thousands","The motion of artificial microswimmers can strikingly resemble collective motion in biological systems even though it only involves physical and chemical processes. A detailed understanding of their emergent swarming properties may therefore help to distinguish merely physics-related from biology-related aspects of motion in biological systems. This will improve our understanding of biological microswimmers, such as bacteria and spermatozoa, and it will provide the background to target the design of swimmers for technical and medical applications. Here, we will focus on modelling a new type of artificial microswimmers where propulsion is achieved by Marangoni flow. To fully characterize the parameter dependence of their motion, we will develop a multiscale description addressing (i) the propulsion mechanism of single swimmers, (ii) interactions between small numbers of swimmers, and (iii) the collective behaviour of large assemblies. We will derive the flow field inside and outside individual droplets, and take into account the two-way coupling of the swimmers motion and the external flow on all the modelling levels. For small numbers of droplets we will develop a flexible CFD model based on a level set method, easily adaptable to different kinds of swimmers. This will allow us to explore the dependence of propulsion on experimentally tunable parameters, like the droplet size and surfactant concentration, and to fully characterize the interactions between swimmers. To simulate the collective behaviour L. Stricker will develop a point-particle combined Lagrangian-Eulerian model that solves the flow and models each swimmer as a rigid particle, undergoing the forces established by the level-set simulations. For such code she will import state-of-the-art techniques from simulations of inertial particles and bubbly flows. All her results will be compared to predictions of theoretical models and to experimental data collected at the MPI-DS.",0,0

980,102031,No,International Mobility Programme to Strengthen Skills and Excellence in Research for Agriculture,"Coordinated by INRA, AgreenSkills has as its strategic goal to reinforce the European leadership in agricultural science by promoting international mobility of researchers both in and out of Europe. By joining the efforts of Research and Higher Education Institutions involved in collaboration with European states, OECD nations and developing countries, AgreenSkills is designed to bring to researchers the widest possible choice of international mobility. To reach this goal, rather than increasing the number of fellowships, the objectives of AgreenSkills are to attract talents and boost high-potential scientists by providing attractive fellowships, increasing hosting capacity, improving application and selection processes, improving scientific mentoring, and enhancing career development. AgreenSkills will rely on the concept of individual mobility, meaning applicants will be able to freely choose their topic, their hosting structure as well as their supervisor. AgreenSkills will support in-coming and out-going mobility provided return takes place within one to two years, the period of time deemed necessary for scientific production, competences and skills sharing, and the establishment of long-lasting collaboration. AgreenSkills will enable talented scientists to identify the most suitable laboratories for their research project through prior resumé and project analyses. As reactivity and flexibility are key factors for the success of the programme, AgreenSkills will fully exploit the autonomy given to the Agreenium organisations, to only handle the preliminary stage aimed at connecting applying fellows and projects to suitable laboratories, the recruitment processes themselves being left to the different Agreenium members following their own rules.",0,0
570,17298,No,European Initiative in Library and Information in Aerospace,"The overall objective of the EURILIA project is to enhance the Libraries R&D and education process in the aerospace sector. For this purpose a new service will be established, based on a pan-European system for information access, retrieval, image browsing and document delivery. This will in turn extend the access and availability of major aerospace collections.  It will develop effective networking links between all EURILIA participants, using a current standard open telecommunications network infrastructure. These links will be used for direct access to the OPACs of significant aerospace collections, based on a standard user interface built on the ISO SR (Z39.50) standard. Document browsing and delivery will be by conventional and electronic image format.  These links will then be used to evaluate the use of the network as a channel for the transmission of document requests and images. Software will be developed to manage these procedures. Parallel with this process, a programme of systematic record access in combination with advanced information retrieval software will be undertaken. Impact and expected results:  EURILIA will demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-site, multi-country document delivery system, with standard user interface and image browsing features, in aerospace libraries. Such a system, by making aerospace related information more easily, more accurately and more extensively available, will facilitate the research and education process in that sector. This in turn will contribute significantly towards European competitiveness in this key industry.  Although the service will be developed for the aerospace industry, it will be applicable to other sectors.  Different pricing systems will be tested in order to minimise cost and maximise benefit and viability of the service.  At the end of the project a workshop will be organised.  Deliverables  A report on the results and analysis of the pre-project audit, including an evaluation of commercial aspects, is currently available. The prototype system and service are classified as restricted or confidential.

699,65238,No,The dynamics of turbulence at a free surface,"The mass, momentum and chemical exchanges that take place at the surface of the ocean are of enormous climatic importance. These processes depend strongly on the characteristics of the flow just beneath the surface, and in particular on the nature of the turbulence there. For these reasons the study of turbulence at a water-air free surface is receiving growing attention, and the last 12 months have seen some significant advances towards the formulation of a framework of an understanding. Before further progress can be made however, dedicated laboratory measurements are required. Scarcely any suitable data are available in the literature, and it is the aim of this project to obtain data specifically to explore the concepts that have been recently proposed. Systematic measurements will be made in turbulent steady and unsteady free surface flows by a variety of techniques, some of them novel and requiring further development. The outcome will be an identification of the turbulence and free surface motion in a range of conditions characterized by the length scale and intensity of displacements of the water surface, and the length scale and intensity of the turbulence just beneath the surface. These results will help to validate existing basic models of the flow, and will identify the dominant features that must be correctly represented in more detailed numerical models yet to be developed. The applicant will acquire experience of advanced laboratory techniques in the study of breaking waves and he will improve and exchange knowledge on optical measurement techniques (LDA, PIV) and acoustic measurements. Interaction with the large research community at Southampton concerned with maritime applications, encompassing the Ship Science group, the Department of Oceanography, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre as well as the growing research group in fluid mechanics in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, will provide diverse opportunities for contributing to multi-disciplinary research projects in this field.

401,227967,No,Paleoenvironmental Assessment of climate and other STressors on long-term dynamics of waterbird populations.,"Anthropogenic climate change affects all countries and so societies need to begin adapting to the ongoing impacts of these changes. In addition, different biomes respond in distinctive ways to climatic warming. For instance, like oceans, Arctic lakes are strongly affected by shorter ice-cover periods, further decreasing albedo which further increases warming. On the other hand, lakes located in Mediterranean regions are experiencing a decrease in the inundation area and water storage due to the magnitude of the droughts.   It is important to say that inland waters are recognised as important sentinels of climatic change and their sediments accumulate records of past environmental conditions. For this reason, we can use these sediment records to study the trends in environmental changes such as warming or wet periods that occurred in the past. Through paleolimnological analyses, past climate history information can be inferred to determine the timing and degree of change in lake ecosystems. Whilst monitoring data may be short, the paleolimnological approach allows for the study of many years of a lake’s history in a very cost and labour effective manner.   Furthermore, inland waters are frequently nesting areas for migratory birds, and these water bodies are especially sensitive to droughts. For this reason, waterbirds may suffer major losses by limited food supplies and habitat, as well as increased disease due to overcrowding. By using paleolimnological approaches, new methodologies allow us to assess past drought periods along with the long-term changes in bird population.  This is why the main objective of this proposal is to study how past droughts and other climatic extremes have affected long-term dynamics of bird populations using paleolimnological approaches in two areas that are being affected by environment change in such different manners: ponds on nesting islands in the Great Lakes region of Canada and the Mediterranean Region of Spain.",0,0
129,57065,Yes,Major research infrastructure of wl/delft hydraulics,"Description:  WL | Delft Hydraulics' experimental facilities are among the largest and best equipped in the world. They permit projects ranging from fundamental research on hydrodynamics and morphology in rivers, estuaries, coastal zones and seas to applied research on breakwaters, components of offshore platforms, pipelines and dredging equipment. Access is provided to the following unique experimental facilities: The almost 100 m long Sand flume, which is well suited for the study of river hydromorphological aspects. This facility is unique for its sediment handling system which enables a continuous flow of water with a specified amount of suspended sediment with a specific grain size distribution. The 130 m long Tidal flume, which can be considered as a schematised estuary. Tide, fresh water discharge, salinity, silt and oxygen concentration can be controlled at its boundaries, which is unique in Europe. Both a tidal flow and wind waves can be generated. The Rotating annular flume and complementary facilities are well suited to carry out detailed studies on the various processes which cohesive sediments undergo in fresh and salty waters, including the direct measurement of bottom shear stress. This facility is unique for its hydraulic loads, its instrumentation and the possibility to carry out tests with bio-chemical or polluted sediments in a temperature controlled environment.  The Oscillating water tunnel, which can be used to investigate the influence of oscillatory flow on the behaviour of bed material on scale 1:1. Tests can be performed with either random or periodic wave conditions, as well as combined flow and wave action, which is unique for its scale and accuracy of hydraulic conditions. The wave paddle of the 230 m long, 5 m wide and 7 m deep Delta Flume (Wave flume for large-scale testing) can generate regular or irregular waves up to a height of 2.5 m. The flume can be used for large-scale experiments reproducing hydrodynamic loading, interaction with small and large bodies and sediment transport. This facility is unique because of its size in combination with a second-order wave steering system and active re-reflection compensation, for both short waves and long waves. The 32 m wide and 45 m long Multi-directional wave basin is equipped with a 26 m wide wave paddle allowing the generation of swell and short-crested waves propagating at any direction within -/- 45 and at the same time reproducing directional spreading. It has an unique reflection compensation system which also suppresses oblique waves at the wave boards. The 55 m long, 1 m wide and 1.2 m deep Glass-wall wave flume has a unique software controlled wave damping system enabling the suppression of parasitic waves. It is also equipped to study wave-current interaction. The Test rig for non-return valves allows the dynamic testing of check values ranging from 300 mm to 800 mm and for the calibration of flow meters up to a diameter of 2000 mm.  The non-stationary, dynamic, testing of two phase flow is unique in Europe. The Dredging flume, with a variable length up to 50 m and width of 9 m can be used for virtually any dredging research project under realistic boundary conditions for various types of soil and rock, which is unique in Europe. By the large scale of the experimental facilities, which avoids scale effects often limiting the applicability in other facilities, the projects significantly contribute to the development of our knowledge of our wet environment and the prediction of changes in our environment, caused by man or nature. State-of-the-art measuring instruments, data-acquisition and processing systems and modern support facilities, such as library, computers and processing & printing is also provided. In addition, the visiting researchers are offered a scientific intellectual environment, with assistance and guidance from WL | Delft Hydraulics' experts covering the wide spectrum of hydraulics and related topics.  Application:  Researchers groups are invited to submit proposals to gain access to any of the above mentioned facilities. The proposal must give a detailed description of the research project, including work programme; names, nationalities and places work of the user group; reason of why the facility is chosen; an estimation of required access days (including days necessary to construct the test set-up(s) in the facility) and when.

FLHYSAFE’s ambition is to demonstrate that a cost efficient modular fuel cell system can replace the most critical safety systems and be used as an emergency power unit (EPU) aboard a commercial airplane providing enhanced safety functionalities. Additionally the project will virtually demonstrate that the system is able to be integrated into current aircraft designs respecting both installation volumes and maintenance constraints. In order to shift from demonstrator levels (achieved in other projects such as Antares DLR H2 and FCH HYCARUS), to the ready-to-certify product level, it is necessary to optimise the different components of the fuel cell system to reduce its weight, increase its lifetime, ensure its reliability, certify its safety and make its costs compatible with market requirements.  Within FLHYSAFE a consortium driven by two major aeronautical Tier 1 OEMs will propose fuel cell technologies using PEM fuel cell stacks, more integrated power converters and air bearing compressors.

119,5177,Yes,Physico-chemical forms of aluminium in non-equilibrium aquatic systems and related biological effects,"To increase the understanding of chemical/geochemical processes influencing biological systems in aquatic mixing zones under severe dis-equilibrium conditions due to acidity vs. liming.   Liming is extensively used in the restoration of acidified lakes and rivers, not only to increase the water pH and alkalinity, but also to reduce the amount of 'toxic' aluminium species to fish and other sensitive organisms. Recent field studies have documented Al-toxicity to fish in the mixing zones between limed streams and acid tributaries. The conditions of severe chemical dis-equilibrium present within such mixing zones appear to result in enhanced toxicity for fish; rates of mortality are higher than in the original acidic waters.  This project, therefore, will address the questions concerning the chemical/geochemical processes leading to enhanced toxicity towards fish in mixing zones between neutral or limed rivers and their acid tributaries. The chemical studies will include aluminium speciation, transformation processes and the kinetics involved. These investigations will be complemented by biological and physiological studies on possible toxic mechanisms responsible for the observed fish mortality.  Experiments will be carried out in the field in two catchments in Norway and Scotland during different seasons (different hydrology, temperatures, and life stages of fish) and in laboratories under controlled exposure (Norway, UK, Belgium, and in the Netherlands). The experiments will focus on:  - the characterisation of Al species by fractionation techniques, and trace element analysis; - transformation processes and kinetics involved, especially the polymerisation of 10w molecular weight Al-species; - interactions with other components influencing the polymerisation of Al species, in particular silicic acid, calcium fluoride and humic substances; - identification of biological responses, especially sublethal effects and fish mortality; - improvement of management practices for countermeasures taken in acidified water systems, e.g. liming of rivers and waters for agricultural practices.",1,1
1121,196022,No,Nanomaterials Ecological Risk Assessment: A study of the long-term effects and risks of nanoscale Iron Oxide used in plastic composites in the aquatic environment,"The nanoform of Iron Oxide (n-Fe2O3) is a large-volume substance used in pigments. Nanoscale Fe2O3 pigments are used to a significant extent in consumer products such as household appliances made of coloured plastic composites. This application implies high probability of n-Fe2O3 release into the aquatic environment (especially during end-of-life processing of the plastics), where n-Fe2O3 may pose risks to freshwater and sediment organisms. Presently, very little is known about the biological interactions and the ecological risks of n-Fe2O3, as the available information addresses only short-term effects of pristine n-Fe2O3. Therefore, the goal of NanoERA is to develop concepts and methods, and to generate data to predict the long-term ecological effects and risks of n-Fe2O3 (fragments) released from end-of-life processing of a coloured plastic composite into the aquatic environment and to compare them to the pristine n-Fe2O3 used to produce the composite. In order to achieve this, the fellow will analyse how the physicochemical properties of the n-Fe2O3 (fragments) change in environmental (i.e. freshwater and sediment) and biological (cell culture) media and how these changes affect the biological interactions of these materials in aquatic organisms. The generated ecotoxicological effects data will be used to derive dose-response relationships and to quantitatively estimate the long-term ecological risks of the n-Fe2O3 (fragments).  In the process of achieving the NanoERA scientific objectives the Marie Curie fellow will obtain training in transferable and technical skills. The fellow’s qualification match very well to the research programme, which promises that NanoERA will produce excellent scientific results, which will be broadly disseminated to achieve significant and long-lasting impact on the European objectives for safe and responsible nanoinnovation.",0,0

415,224232,No,Research platform on antibiotic resistance spread through wastewater treatment plants,"Development and proliferation of antibiotic resistance is classified among major global threats by the World Health Organization. Sanitation of the water cycle is essential to sustain environmental and human health. Within urban water systems, public and governmental perception is rising on the role of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their microbiomes as putative hotspots for the proliferation of antibiotic resistances, and the need for new quality criteria and installation upgrades. However, because of methodological biases, our knowledge remains limited on the emission, fate and possible amplification or removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across WWTPs. There is an urgent need to develop standardized methods and database for the accurate identification, characterization, and quantification of antibiotic resistances in such complex water matrices. REPARES brings excellence in research on spread of antibiotic resistance in WWTPs through establishing cooperation of UCT with leading European innovators and internationally-renowned expert of the water-related antibiotic resistance field: UCP will share its expert leadership in wastewater-mediated antibiotic resistance; TUDelft will deliver methods to successfully apply for international projects; Wetsus will propel cooperation with the non-academic sector; AAU will integrate the REPARES database within the world-accepted MiDAS database. REPARES aims at advancing the European community‘s know-how on antibiotic resistance across sanitation waterways, which in the future will bring society to closer achieve Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations.

408,95689,No,"Christianity in China. Western Culture in front of the Far East. Adaptionism, Syncretism and Simulation. The specific case of a small and important group of French Jesuits: the Figurists","The Society of Jesus was the link between Europe and the Far East. This was possible thanks to the elaboration of an entirely new model of evangelization based on the assumption that cultural differences were to be “ironed out” in favor of similarities that allowed the Jesuits to enter, like a Trojan horse, the alien culture: this model was called accommodatio. The second step of this strategy was the extraordinary production of books and pamphlets written by Jesuits in the centuries of their missionary activity in the Far East. Chronicles, travel accounts, and polemical treatises accompanied the Jesuits’ mission, and found a Western audience among Enlightenment thinkers, to the point that the “discovery” of China became a fundamental point of reference of Western culture. This is the traditional account but it is necessary and possible now to verify it by using a new approach. First, it is necessary to read again the documents regarding the first penetration of Christianity in China, in the prospective of sixteenth-century European culture: literary culture of simulation or honest dissimulation in the European courts, nicodemism in religious thinking, and in the specific contest of Society of Jesus (in Europe and outside); from Matteo Ricci onwards, specially the writings of first Jesuits in China, and the regulations and discussions inside the Society. Finally, we need to look at them through the Figurists, when nicodemism or similar is replaced by a new way of cultural interpretation that really joins together the Western and Far East worlds. A bibliographical investigation of the Figurists’ writings (often not printed), their contact with European philosophes and the role they had in the Enlightenment’s evolution of concepts of China will complete the study.",0,0
903,5196,No,European river margins as indicators of global change,"To test the hypothesis that river margin wetlands are more sensitive to environmental change than the adjacent aquatic or terrestrial systems.   River margin ecosystems are a dynamic interface between the terrestrial and aquatic environment where biological processes and biodiversity tend to be maximised. This is because river margins share the properties of the terrestrial and aquatic systems which results in high biogeochemical and physical diversity. Therefore it is currently thought that river margin wetlands will be among the first systems to react to landscape alteration due to global change.  The ERMAS project will test the hypothesis that river margin ecosystems are more sensitive to environmental change than the adjacent aquatic or terrestrial systems. The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the rates of three biological processes occurring in the terrestrial, river margin and aquatic habitats of 5 rivers along a latitudinal gradient from northern Sweden at 64°N latitude to Southern France at 43°N. These processes are plant colonisation, litter decomposition and denitrification. The comparison will be based on the local temperature, soil moisture, and flooding variation that occurs during the annual cycle typical for the 5 rivers. If global change is occurring, the range of physical parameters observed along this gradient, and their effect on biological processes, should allow an understanding of the possible environmental impact due to those changes.  Each of the five project partners will carry out a set of standardized research protocols on the 3 processes. For each river, measurements will be taken along a transect from within the river, through the margin wetland, into the terrestrial system. Additional studies, such as regarding hydrology, hyporheic processes, biodiversity, ecoregions, landscape, and socio-economic considerations will complement the core investigations. These studies will add information to the understanding of the overall comparison.  On this basis, the ERMAS project will provide the base line on biogeochemical processes occurring in river margin habitats as well as for recommendations on river margin wetland management at the European level.",0,0
954,4792,No,Study of the influence of argillaceous particles on the conditions for reinjection of cooled geothermal fluid into the miocene sandstone reservoir of the Madrid basin,"The objective of this project is to study the injectivity of the sandstone reservoir of the Madrid Basin and to devise ways to avoid reservoir plugging.    In many European countries, the geothermal reservoirs are of detrital origin.   For an economic utilization of low enthalpy fluids, very high production rates are required (at least 100 cubic metres per hour but often twice or three times this figure).   As geothermal water usually contains salts and gas, it is essential to reinject the fluid, after cooling, into the same reservoir at a certain distance. The main problem arises with this reinjection and many projects failed in the past because of a rapid deterioration of the parameters of the reinjection.   Some studies carried out in the Madrid basin by SPEG, TRT and others, have shown that the principal cause of the limitation of the reinjection is the presence of fine particles in the water displaced. It has been established that, even after decantation and filtration, a careful control of the particles in the fluid is necessary.   A programme including the participation of several specialists has been established.   Preliminary tests will be made during pumping from the Geomadrid 1 well, the water being discharged to the river using filters, portable granulometers and a particle counter. After this first test, the selection of the permanent equipment will be made and actual reinjection could start.  At the same time, exchange of data and even of core material is foreseen with the partners of the TNO (Netherlands) project 'Improvement of the injectivity index of argillaceous sandstones' (contract no. 0183).  The realization of the entire system: decantation, filtration and permanent control of the fluid, will represent an important result for number of projects in the geothermal industry.",1,0

In the first phase, after evaluating all relevant literature on these techniques as applied to water surveys, the individual techniques of Georadar and high resolution seismics will be optimised for working on and under water. - In the case of seismics, this means developing a multiple offset data aquisition system, software to correct for the effects of wave movement, and new processing software to enhance resolution and filter out the effects of gas content in the sediments. - In the case of Georadar, it means developing a new positioning system on and underwater, developing software to counter the rapid attenuation of the signal underwater, optimising frequency range, and linking to sonar. A new submersible georadar antenna will also be produced by one of the RTD partners. In the second phase of the project, the combined techniques will be tested at 6 sites in Europe covering lakes to rivers to canals, with a range of sediment and contaminated sludge types, which will serve as case histories. Where needed, the techniques can be optimised, based on feedback from the field trials. Processing of the individual data contains the additional factor of ensuring format compatibility, which is essential if the crucial integration step will succeed. The aim is to produce a practical site surveying tool with guidelines for use, and a data management platform which links data manipulation to an easy-to-use, graphical interface. Since this project aims to turn scientific results into a practical geophysical tool for environmental applications, there is a separate task devoted to the 6 case history sites, so that the results of surveying must be used to work out the economic and environmental impact of remediation work. The results of this task also are very important in the dissemination of results to end-users and stakeholders, and provide input also to the task of Market Surveying and Dissemination, without which the results of the project would fail to gain access to a wider audience.  The project has the following quantifiable deliverables: - an integrated GPR/shallow seismic system for sludge quantification in underwater sediments - development of automatic layer discrimination GPR software, regarding water/sludge/solids - calculating software for automatic generation of cubic meters to be dredged - Enhanced, real-time imaging system for data visualisation and presentation - a management tool for end-user authorities and dredging companies - Data archival and data management system. - a new, submersible GeoRadar antenna.  Problems to be solved:  Europe's water ways are becoming increasingly contaminated with sludge (soft, bottom sediments) polluted with heavy metals, pesticides, hydrocarbons, and other toxins. Cost effective remediation depends on an accurate 3D mapping of these layers. This project combines two non-invasive geophysical techniques, Georadar and High Resolution Shallow Seismics for the first time to deliver an advanced, integrated detection system which can be used for high-resolution site surveys, and which is a major improvement on current methods. Completion of the project will mean that environmental site surveying and subsequent remediation will become more cost effective, and therefore implemented more often - if the project is not carried out, costs will remain prohibitive for many organisations.  Expected Impacts:  The SME partners are geophysical companies working on the cutting edge of new technologies, who need to maintain their lead over any competitors in and outside the EU. Without the technical support of this project, this lead will not be maintained. The costs of cleaning the European Waterways is estimated to b be confirmed by e 27.4 Billion , if all waterways need to be remediated. This can only site surveys. The costs of surveying the waterways is 700 M . The SME partners intend to ensure that they occupy a significant part of this niche market, and other potential users will benefit through licenses of the technology. In the end, by cleaning polluted waterways in the EU the greatest benefit will be to the environment of Europe and its people.",0,0
437,103405,No,Training and collaboration on material developments and process improvements in oil and sugar production,"The problems encountered in the industrial processing of oil and sugar are connected with corrosion, biochemical and/or biological reactions, friction, wear, and combined corrosion-wear of materials used in mechanical parts. The main concerns are on one hand a material degradation that generates risks of contamination during food production, and on the other hand the actual machinery that needs to be improved from a technological and an economical point of view.  This project aims to intensify research and training activities in the fields of science and technology of main importance in oil and sugar production, and to contribute by a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the limits of existing production technologies. Partners intend to contribute to find solutions to these complex problems by carrying out research projects through networking activities, by organizing the training of young researchers, and by transferring among them advanced technology- and material-related knowledge.  The activities proposed are aimed at investigating: - the mechanisms of material degradation with a peculiar attention on the specific biological surroundings encountered in oil and sugar processing, - the recent developments in metallic materials and coating technologies as to optimize the characteristics of materials and to increase process efficiency in oil and sugar production, - new processing technologies and research methodologies made available by partners.  The complementary of the partners’ backgrounds is a guarantee to generate new scientific and technological insights as an attraction pole of young researchers for material and process developments in oil and sugar production. Modern methods of surface modification of materials, new extraction technology, novel biocompatible materials, and advanced ex- and/or in-situ characterization methods of material surfaces are the core of this project.",0,0
571,24007,No,Development of improved conservation procedures for archaeological iron,"The primary objectives of the projects are:  1. quantitative assessment of the effects of existing and novel treatments leading to development of improved conservation procedures for archaeological iron artifacts, and  2. definition of optimum treatment procedures and a strategy for the selection of a treatment method matched to the initial condition (i.e. corrosion product structure or state of deterioration) of the object and to its environmental exposure conditions.   The preservation of collected cultural objects is one of the most important objectives of any museum. For many materials effective and acceptable conservation methods have been established but this does not apply to archaeological iron. Whilst there is agreement regarding the causes of instability of such material, and regarding the deterioration processes, the large amount of work on various treatment and stabilisation methods for archaeological iron has not provided a consensus about a preferred treatment. There is thus a need to develop and validate, on a scientific and quantitative basis, reliable and suitable conservation procedures for archaeological iron artifacts. The objectives of this project are the development of improved conservation procedures for archaeological iron artifacts, and definition of optimum treatment procedures and strategies for the selection of a treatment method matched to the initial conditions of the object and to its environmental exposure conditions. The procedures may be combinations of existing techniques or may involve novel approaches developed from an understanding of the requirements for effective stabilisation. This proposal is for collaboration between the Corrosion and protection Centre, UMIST, UK, and the School of Conservation, Copenhagen, DK. A major reason for the lack of agreed procedures is that their effects, in terms of both stability of artifacts and physical alteration, have been poorly quantified in the past. Work under an STEP contract (on Assessment of and Criteria for the Stability of Iron Artifacts, involving the two partners above) has shown that electrochemical methods can be used to follow processes occurring during solution treatment and to assess stability of artifacts in a quantitative and sensitive manner. This proposal is for a project which applies this knowledge base, and the expertise developed. Thus, methods for the selection of procedures will be based on quantitative assessment of the effects of the procedures and on an understanding of the processes occurring during and after treatment. Novel approaches to be considered include the use of non-aggressive neutral washing solutions and the use of inhibitors to enhance long term stability of desalinated artifacts, in part to attempt to mitigate the damaging effects of environmental pollutants.",0,0
617,99627,No,Microbial activities of the sulfur cycle in the subsurface of the Iberian Pyritic Belt,"'Microbial processes in subsurface ecosystems are of increasing interest due to their implications for mankind, in regards to energy, climate and health. However, these ecosystems are among the least understood. The Iberian Pyritic Belt (IPB), located in southwestern Spain is one of the largest sulfide deposits on Earth. It is of tremendous interest due to its high concentrations of metals (As, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni ..), and constant low pH (mean 2.3) in ground and surface waters. This has been largely attributed to mining practices over the last 5,000 years. However, recent evidence points to subsurface microbial processes contributing significantly to the oxidative processes that lead anomalous metal concentrations and low pH. Next to nothing is known about microorganisms and the processes they mediate in this system. The sulfur cycle occupies a central role in the biogeochemical pathways that occur in this ecosystem. Therefore, the goal of this project is to conduct a multidisciplinary study into the role microorganisms play in the cycling of sulfur, and implications of this on the local geology and groundwater geochemistry within the IPB. This project will innovatively combine tools that span engineering, geology, geochemistry and microbiology to achieve the following: (1) Identify regions where the oxidation of sulfides, both pyritic and non pyritic and the reduction of sulfate are occurring. (2) Determine the relationship between microbial community structure and underlying geochemical changes. (3) Determine microorganisms, mechanisms, and factors controlling pyrite oxidation, sulfide oxidation and sulfate reduction. (4) Develop a geomicrobial model for the sulfur cycle and it affects on local geology and groundwater geochemistry in the IPB. This project responds to key targets set by FP7: It will contribute to the competiveness of European science by promoting the transfer of knowledge, and by engaging in timely, innovative and novel research.'",0,0
369,192271,No,Standards and Interoperability for eInfrastructure Implementation Initiative,"Interoperability, which brings major benefits for enterprise and science, is key for the pervasive adoption of grids & clouds. Interoperability between existing grids and clouds is of primary importance for the European Union today. Many of the policy issues required to achieve interoperability with DCIs across the world are already being explored through the Infrastructure Policy Group (IPG) that meets regularly and which has representation from major production e-Infrastructures globally. SIENA, in 2 years, shows how Europe, which has already invested heavily on building e-infrastructures, addresses issues regarding the adoption of grid, cloud and distributed computing infrastructure standards. SIENA starts at a strategic point in time when the development of standards and interoperability is a key priority to be addressed, especially in RTD activities, and where it is evident that the ICT standardisation landscape is dramatically making more of an impact than ever in the last decade. While the grid concept developed to support the federation of research computing resources, the cloud concept developed to support the dynamic provisioning of computation, storage and communications with attractive business models. Given the scope of these developments, it is recognized that no one organization can manage the entire landscape of potential activities. The need to augment community building across user groups with community building across standards organizations to drive specification adoption forward in order to achieve these goals is key.In detail:- Drive forward the development and adoption of Interoperability and Standards in relation to the European  DCI community & SDOs;- Elaborate the future research infrastructure scenario through roadmapping connecting into relevant SDOs to drive forward production of relevant standards & best practices.- Support, plan & organise a series of outreach events viz: 2 roadmap international events in Europe, 2 Cloudscape workshops.",0,0
565,73989,No,Innovative In Situ CO2 Capture Technology for Solid Fuel Gasification (ISCC),"The new process technology proposed is based on steam gasification of low rank, high moisture brown coal, which includes the high temperature removal of CO2 by using high temperature efficient sorbent materials. The combination of both, the gasification and the in situ CO2 capture initiates a shift reaction in product gas composition towards H2. Experiments with different hydrocarbons and dolomite revealed that hydrogen concentrations higher than 95 vol % can be achieved using this technology. The CO2 laden sorbent material has to be regenerated in an additional calcinations step, generating a pure CO2 gas stream for subsequent sequestration. The proposed project aims on exploiting this potential to produce a gas stream in the regeneration process consisting of >95% CO2. The work programme includes the screening of available inputs and required product quality, basic process investigations, pilot scale experiments and technical and socio-economic evaluation considering technical, social, ethical and economic criterions Expected Results are a detailed definition of an environmentally friendly, high efficient coal technology producing a highly H2 enriched product gas and in situ CO2 capture; a detailed technical assessment of process efficiency in terms of energy (coal to H2) and CO2 captured (% of input) and a life cycle assessment of H2 production costs and costs per t of CO2 captured.",0,0

1032,32553,No,Microbenthic communities in European Rivers used to assess effects of land-derived toxicants,"The aim of the proposed study is to assess community effects of toxicant fluxes in rivers. This can be achieved through a new methodology incorporating the large biological and chemical differences among European rivnrs. The fate and biological effectivity of toxicants in river system is supposed to be greatly affected by the concurrent loading with humics and various ions. To verify this, the speciation of metals, herbicides and PAH will be quantified. For metals, an experimental mobile voltametric instrument will be used together with sorption on chelating resins.  Dialysis of isotope-labelled organic toxicants will be used to assess Sifferences in speciation of selected herbicides and PAH among rivers. When chemicals are present in biologically effective concentrations, these are likely to induce changes in the tolerance profile and species composition of communities. Such changes will be assessed in a selection of rivers, using natural communities of closely stacked micro-algae, Bacteria and microfauna, settled on sand and cobbles. Short-term metabolic tests will be used to describe the sensitivity of photosynthesis in algae (14 C-technique), DNA multiplication in bacteria (3H-thymidine method), and replication in eukaryotes (e.g.ciliates; adenine/thymidine method).  Differences in tolerance to selected compounds (metals, herbicides, PAH), neasured with these physiological techniques will be compared with longterm community changes observed at river stations polluted with either a single type of contaminants or complex mixtures. Communities in artificial streams are used to verify questions raised in these field studies.  Photometric alternatives for the isotope-based physiological techniques will be developed to allow wider application in future and a mobile Facility for in situ community tests will be created.  The project will bring the biological and chemical approaches together into case studies of river pollution in northern, western and southern Burope. The complementary expertise of the partners allow an assessment of the consequences and risks of toxicant input in rivers that differs considerably from traditional methods based on a strategy of 'one species at a time' and 'one substance at a time'.  The proposed research is likely to fulfil the needs of a growing Matchment oriented management of pollutants in Europe.

Summary of the Action: ECOWAT supports the Commission Services and national/international bodies linked to EU policy issues with: 1) delivery of comparable data sets and environmental indicators; 2) their subsequent integration into sound scientific information at various geographical scales, and; 3) carrying out scientific and technical tasks related to implementation and monitoring of Directives. The activities within ECOWAT address topics related to water quality (e.g. eutrophication, ecological quality status), and support the management of inland, coastal and marine areas. The derived information constitutes a basis to compare and set harmonised objectives for the ecological quality status of surface waters on a European scale; and the tools developed contribute to the implementation of integrated approaches to coastal zone management. Within the frame of the European Centre for Ecological Water Quality and Inter-Calibration (in collaboration with DG ENV and CIS of WFD) this Action also provides a platform for the inter- calibration and harmonisation of the ecological quality assessment systems in the EU.  In particular, ECOWAT targets the implementation and monitoring of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Nitrates Directive, the Urban Waste Water Treatment (UWWT) Directive, the European Marine Strategy, the 6th Environmental Action Program and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (A Strategy for Europe). Rationale The EU has applied and continues to develop water protection policies covering inland, coastal and marine aquatic ecosystems. The implementation and monitoring of legislation and policies necessitate the provision of reliable and comparable data and information, and assessment tools. These political instruments (e.g. Directives) derive from an increasing public concern about citizen's health, preservation of natural resources and bio-diversity, as well as address the protection against natural disasters and/or anthropogenic insults. The overall objective of this Action is to provide scientific and technical support, data and tools to assist the definition, implementation and monitoring of EU water policies and legislation.",0,0
474,224754,No,"SOCRATIC: A real-time effluent management software based on artificial intelligence and industrial automation, specific for the prevention of combined sewage overflow","Storm water overflows (also known as Combined Sewer Overflow, CSO) can occur during small to heavy rainfalls, if there is no proper management of the storage capacity in combined sewer systems. The share of combined sewer is more than 50% in 10 European states. CSOs carry chemical and microbiological pollution, hazardous substances and waste affecting the quality of water and environment putting at risk human and animal health and aquatic life. Between 2014-2017, 3.130 pollution events affecting only bathing waters were reported (Source EEA).  The Urban Waste Water Directive requires the Member States to “decide on measures to limit the pollution from storm water overflows”. Beneath the option to build new infrastructures to increase retention capacities, which is a long and expensive process, the solution is to manage efficiently and adapt instantly existing canalisation systems and storage tanks. Currently, storm water management systems that aim to implement the latter concept focus on flood protection, which occurs only with heavy rainfalls. Moreover, they are based on weather forecasts that are unreliable and not accurate and hydraulic simulation software that need high computing times up to 24h.  The French SME IXSANE Sas with more than 20 years of experience in Environmental & Urban engineering has developed SOCRATIC, an innovative effluent management system specific for CSOs prevention, that works with accurate real time storm water levels, fast Artificial Intelligence simulation and automated processes. A low cost technology, which provides savings of up to 90% in comparison to the construction of new infrastructures. SOCRATIC will reduce by 80% the number of CSO events and by 60% the volume of leaks released into the environment.  IXSANE will target the Municipal Water Market, precisely the Smart Water Segment, where the share of Software and Automation is worth 8.83 Billion € in 2017 with a CAGR of 33,9% (Source Frost& Sullivan).",1,0

The regional model will take into account the impacts of demographic trends, economic and technological development, the effects of global climate and land use changes on the availability and quality of water bodies in humid temperate, sub humid tropical as well as semiarid regions. The existing integration framework will be first tested in a European river basin with high data availability and data density. The project team and river basin organisations in two river basins in Westafricaand Uzbekistan will jointly test the Transferability of the model to other regions with different economic level, ecological standards and with low data availability. Here, the problem of adequate human resources and the uncertainties of input data for the implementation of computer based decision support tools will be addressed. Capacity building through training of end users supports the transfer of the research results into application. In cooperation with stakeholders and potential users integrated scenarios of economic growth, land use and climate change will be developed and the model will be used to assess the implications for water management under the respective scenario assumptions. The twinning of river basins will promote mutual transfer of know-how and technology between European and Third countries. Based on the results, river basin management plans cane prepared.

The wide variety of tests will include from damping behavior and vibro-acoustic performance to lightning strike protection, including aging, common mechanical properties and physicochemical tests. Needed panels and embedded design will be done and manufactured by the partners.  Results of the cited works altogether will guide to the optimal design and manufacturing of trials, which will reach to material improvements also.

1179,58644,No,Ecoval - internet platform for environmental assessment and trends,"To date, environmental projects have tended to focus on the role that industry and big business plays with regards to pollution. However, there is a complete dearth of accessible information on the impact that the individual citizen has on the environment as a global system. While many people are conscious of environmental issues, they have no means by which to judge their overall impact on the environment. To this end, ECOVAL fills a vital gap in the environmental knowledge base through the innovative development of an internet platform that enables individuals to assess the impact of their lifestyle on the environment. Through primary data collection, based on self-completed questionnaires, Coeval's internet platform will build a database of individuals' CO2 emissions which, in turn, will provide a tool for cross-regional and European-wide comparison. Ultimately, the platform will enable EU decision makers to adapt their environmental policies to their local population.",0,0
957,210513,No,RECOVERY AND UTILIZATION OF NUTRIENTS 4 LOW IMPACT FERTILIZER,"Domestic wastewater (WW) is an important carrier of nutrients usually wasted away by current decentralised WW treatments (WWT). Run4Life proposes an alternative strategy for improving nutrient recovery rates and material qualities, based on a decentralised treatment of segregated black water (BW), kitchen waste and grey water combining existing WWT with innovative ultra-low water flushing vacuum toilets for concentrating BW, hyper-thermophilic anaerobic digestion as one-step process for fertilisers production and bio-electrochemical systems for nitrogen recovery. It is foreseen up to 100% nutrient (NPK) recovery (2 and >15 times current P and N recovery rates) and >90% water reuse. Obtained products will be >90% reused thanks to prospective end-users in the consortium and a new Business model based on a cooperative financial scheme. Run4Life impacts will be evaluated on safety and security (Risk Assessment), from an environmental point of view (Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Technical Verification), on the economy (Benefit Cost Analysis) and considering Social Risk Perception. Active measures will be developed with the support of a Stakeholders and Exploitation Panel for achieving institutional, legal and social acceptance. Different parts of Run4Life will be large scale demonstrated at 4 demo-sites in Belgium, Spain, Netherlands and Sweden, adapting the concept to different scenarios (market, society, legislation). Performance tests will be carried out with obtained products (compared to commercial fertilisers) with close collaboration with fertiliser companies. Process will be optimised by on-line monitoring key performance indicators (nutrient concentration, pathogens, micropollutants). The information obtained in the 4 demo-sites will be used for process simulation to conceive a unified Run4Life model which will be applied in a fifth demo-site in Czech Republic, allowing new business opportunities and providing data for critical raw material policies.",1,0
172,222551,Yes,bIo-mimetic and phyto-techNologies DesIgned for low-cost purficAtion and recycling of water,"INDIA-H20 will develop, design and demonstrate high-recovery, low-cost water treatment systems for saline groundwater and industrial wastewaters. The focus for developments will be in the arid state of Gujarat, where surface water resources are very scarce. We will develop novel batch-reverse osmosis technology for a 10-fold reduction in specific energy consumption with high fractions of water recovery (80%) reducing /m3 operating costs to below €0.35/m3 (<30 rupees/m3). Forward osmosis will be developed and piloted for use in wastewater recovery applications including hybrid arrangements with reverse osmosis for further reduction in energy consumption. These solutions will be demonstrated in small-scale rurally relevant low-cost systems for brackish groundwater treatment for use as safe drinking water, which will be extended to include phyto-technology solutions for rural domestic wastewater treatment. Systems will remove salinity and emerging pollutants (e.g. agricultural chemicals), valorise rejected brines in halophytic crop cultivation. For specific industrial wastewater in textile, desalination and dairy we will develop and demonstrate cost-effective high-efficiency hybrid technologies for water recycling with minimum liquid discharge, using advanced membrane technologies to achieve the required water quality for recycling. A centre of excellence will be established in water treatment membrane technologies, design operation and monitoring. Activities such as supply chain mapping and EU India collaboration on developing industrial scale forward osmosis membranes and batch-RO systems will support the development of business models to exploit the developed solutions to mutual EU/India economic advantage. We will analyse and produce policy briefs on economic models and governance arrangements for viable adoption of the developed systems.",1,1
116,52075,Yes,Modelling ecological quality of urban rivers: ecotoxicological factors limiting restoration of fish populations.,"Problems to be solved The objectives of the project are to determine the ecotoxicological factors limiting restoration of sustainable fish populations in polluted urban rivers. These factors will be described and modelled for urban river systems in four European countries, Italy, Germany The Netherlands and the UK. By monitoring the conditions in each river and the natural fish population, then using caged fish to sample the environmental and biological factors that limit sustainable fish populations, the project will address the problems relating to the establishment of a standardised and validated array of bio-indicator measurements, for use in water quality surveillance and monitoring schemes, in support of environmental policies for integrated water management. A parallel sociological study of risk perception in stakeholders will provide information on peoples' perceptions and expectations with regard to water. The CEC Council have as their aim the remediation of European surface and ground waters in order that they achieve 'good' ecological status by the year 2010. This project will contribute to the objectives of Key Action 1, Sustainable management and quality of water and in particular, key action 1.2, Ecological quality of freshwater ecosystems and wetlands, and specifically key action 1.2.2, Ecological quality targets. Scientific objectives and approach At each site, the ecological quality of the study river will be described on a seasonal basis in terms of biotic indices and chemical water quality, and related to the population biology of a resident species of coarse (tolerant) fish. Sub-lethal indicators of pollution will then be measured on fish exposed to the prevailing seasonal water conditions at each site, in floating cages. A range of biochemical indicators (biomarkers) will be used to reveal specific exposure to particular contaminants or classes of contaminants. These will include: induction of cytochrome P450 and metallothioneins; DNA damage, in terms of strand breaks; estrogenic activity (measured as vitellogenin induction); brain cholinesterase activity. Measurement of swimming performance will be used as an indicator of physiological status, revealing seasonal differences and the response to exposure to the complex changes in water chemistry, following flood spates. These measurements will be related to migration of fish within the river system, using radio tracking or tag and recapture. The immunological status of fish (e.g. macrophage activity) will be assessed, as urban waters can be subject to elevated contents of pathogenic bacteria from human waste and, furthermore, fish in poor condition as a result of pollution and other physico-chemical stresses may have compromised immune competence. Data analysis will use current methodologies for multivariate statistics to model the ecotoxicological factors limiting fish populations at the study sites, enabling the elaboration of ecological risk assessments and sensitive water quality criteria for a range of European rivers. A sociological study will be undertaken, to investigate the way that various groups of people with an interest in rivers (stakeholders) perceive the risks associated with poor ecological quality in urban rivers. Expected impacts The project provides community added value by bringing together a multidisciplinary spectrum of expertise and experience from various EU institutions, for the measurement and analysis of a wide range of state-of the art chemical, biochemical, physiological, and immunological indicators of sub-lethal pollution. This will introduce a valuable diversity of assessments of ecological quality, pollutant class, and environmental fluctuation that will contribute significantly to our ability to develop a generic methodology transferable to other urban rivers within Europe and elsewhere. The results will be published in the international literature and provided to local authorities (namely the National River Authority in the UK, the Regione Lombardia in Italy, the Berlin Fishery Board in Berlin). Furthermore, assay techniques for analysis of biomarkers will be standardised amongst the research centres, and measurements on sub-samples will be repeated by these different labs, in order to contribute to EU-wide standardisation of ecotoxicological assay procedures. The sociological analysis of stakeholder views on the risks posed by pollution will indicate to what degree there is likely to be interest in and compliance with the introduction of new bio indicators of pollution. The outcome of the project will be an overview of the combined technological and socio-economic factors involved in implementation of an urban river ecosystem with a sustainable population of healthy fish.",1,1
1065,20181,No,INTEGRATION OF LIQUID-AMMONIA TREATMENTS IN FINISHING OPERATIONS FOR CELLULOSIC MATERIALS,"Liquid ammonia treatment is a specific and innovative pre-finishing technique ; it responds to the need for high-quality cellulosic fabrics which fulfil modern consumer's demands. However, successful industrial application of this technique can only be achieved if the process is fully integrated into the complete production-line (from woven fabric to the finished end-product). Liquid ammonia treatments can only be realised on special equipment ; at the moment, only two firms in the EEC can perform the treatment. On the other hand, weavers and finishers, mostly SME's, are spread all over Europe. Consequently, integration of liquid ammonia treatments into the total process forms an important challenge, taking into account the small batches, and the need for flexibility, just-in-time response, high quality requirements and various demands for the finished end-products. In order to obtain optimum results, it is essential that the interaction between raw fabric parameters, pre-treatments, liquid ammonia treatments, post-finishing operations, and end-product quality are fully understood and controlled (process-modelling). For cotton it was shown that liquid ammonia treatments introduce major modifications in the fine-structure of the fibres.   For more complex fibres, such as flax, little is known about the influence of liquid ammonia treatments on the supra-molecular- and crystallographic structure of the cellulose, and on the consequences for subsequent finishing. In this project, the interactions between the different stages in the global finishing-operation will be studied : changes in the fundamental properties and in the physico-chemical properties will be examined, and methods for the evaluation of the quality of the materials will be established.  The results clearly indicate to what extent and in what direction the properties of linen fabrics can be modified by the application of liquid ammonia treatments. In particular it has been demonstrated that liquid ammonia treatments, combined with suitable finishing procedures, allow a considerable improvement of the easy-care properties of linen. The companies are now fully aware of the potential of both types of liquid ammonia treatments for easy-care finishing of linen; and have also acquired knowledge about the integration of such treatments in the total finishing line.   The industrial participants are now able to make immediate use of the results and integrate liquid ammonia treatments into their own production line:  - Veramtex for the application of liquid ammonia treatments on linen fabrics; - linen finishers (Pietro Gay, Masureel Veredeling) for the finishing of liquid ammonia treated linen fabrics; - linen weavers (Telene, Lagae) for the adequate choice of fabrics to be treated in liquid ammonia and for the definition of quality requirements for specific market segments (clothing).",0,0

86,108389,Yes,Novel approaches for enhancing the treatment of drinking water by ultrafiltration and evaluating the mechanisms at nano-scale,"The application of membrane technology in the treatment of drinking water has been rapidly increasing in recent years, and particularly the process of ultrafiltration (UF). While some expertise and research activities relating to UF technology currently exist within the European Union, the applicant, Dr Yu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has unique knowledge and research experience of UF pre-treatment methods, which are essential to the optimal performance of the UF process. His proposed fellowship offers an important opportunity for collaboration between two internationally leading research institutions to advance the technology and facilitate the transfer of Dr Yu’s expertise to Imperial College London and the wider European research community. The proposed Marie Curie fellowship will concentrate on developing novel approaches to enhancing UF performance to achieve higher quality treated water cost-effectively and with greater operational efficiency (e.g. through reduced membrane fouling). The fundamental mechanisms involved in these processes will be investigated at nanometer-scale, which will expose the interactions between floc particles, activated carbon and membrane surfaces. In addition, the combination of coagulation-UF treatment with downstream processes, involving a second stage of UF preceded by ozone oxidation and organics adsorption via waste-derived activated carbon, to further enhance water quality, will also be evaluated in this project. In conclusion, the proposed project is expected to provide important and valuable results for the European research community and for water utilities using UF processes in water treatment plants currently, or planning new plants in the future.",0,1
718,6299,No,NEW BIOCOMPATIBLE POLYMERS BASED ON CELL MEMBRANE MIMETICS,"The objective of the project was the development of new, improved haemocompatible polymers biocompatible polymers and surface treatments for implants and medical devices. The improved materials were achieved by mimicking the chemical structure of the outer surface of the red blood cell membrane. The natural membrane exhibits excellent biocompatibility and haemocompatibility.  A series of new polymers and surface treatments, which contain the same phosphorlycholine structure as the blood cell membrane has been successfully synthesized and the new compounds fully characterized. In a series of in vitro simulated in use tests, the new biomimetic polymers and surface treatments showed significantly better haemocompatibility and biocompatibility than even the best of the polymeric biomaterials in use commercially today. The benefits of this improved biocompatibility will be seen in the improved efficiency and performance of: specialized blood handling devices such as apheresis and haemodialysis filters; blood oxygenators; extracorporeal blood circuitry; intravenous and central venous catheters which will be less thrombogenic, longer indwelling the easier to introduce; improved contact and intraocular lenses; cell culture ware with improved cell attachment, growth and spreading.  The cell membrane contains a wide range of molecular species including phospholipids. It is the phospholipid components which give the membrane its structure and essential characteristics. The phospholipids in the membrane are arranged in a bilayer structure with their phosphate head groups exposed at the surface. Whilst all phospholipids carry a charge, the outer membrane surface contains 90 to 95% zwitterionic, neutral phosphorylcholine (PC) lipids. It has been shown that zwitterionic PCs do not initiate blood coagulation, whereas the other charged PCs do. It was reasoned that by attaching zwitterionic PCs to a surface, the surface would mimic that of the red blood cell membrane and th us become more haemocompatible and biocompatible. The project called for the selection and synthesis of PC containing compounds which could be either polymerized into PC polymers or used to modify other surfaces, (eg, as coatings). In the course of the research, surface reactive PC compounds, PC monomers, PC homopolymers, PC graft polymers, and PC copolymers were all successfully synthesized, characterized and attached or coated onto a range of polymeric surfaces.  In extensive in vitro haemocompatibility tests, all of the PC surfaces showed significant improvements in haemocompatibility compared untreated controls. In simulated in use tests, similarly enhanced biocompatibility resulted from the presence of the PC. The improved haemocompatibility was also confirmed in preliminary in vivo studies. THE EXTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE SURFACES OF RED BLOOD CELLS ARE EXTREMELY HAEMOCOMPATIBLE. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP POLYMERS AND SURFACE TREATMENTS WHICH MIMIC THE NATURAL SURFACE OF RED BLOOD CELLS. THE SYNTHETIC BIOMIMETIC POLYMERS AND SURFACE TREATMENTS TO BE DEVELOPED WILL BE DESIGNED TO BE NON-THROMBOGENIC AND HIGHLY RESISTANT TO PROTEIN ADSORPTION.

390,206776,No,SMart rObOTs for fire-figHting,"Over the years, changes in modern infrastructure have introduced new challenges to firefighting practices. Training and research programs have been developed to manage these challenges but there are still significant losses from fires each year. In 2013 alone, the fire departments in the USA responded to over 1.2 million fires which resulted in about 3,420 civilian fatalities, 15,925 injuries and property losses of about $12.4 billion dollars. In the UK, 192,600 fires responses, approximately 350 civilian fatalities, 10,300 injuries. The firefighting and rescue functions of the existing equipment and apparatus and their dexterity are limited, particularly in the harsh firefighting environments. The SMOOTH project aims to propose a novel robot-assisted decision making system in smart firefighting to perform searching and rescuing practice in the fire ground, and to facilitate the decision makings with higher efficiency.   In the proposed system, a dexterous group of autonomous robots will be ingested, including an Octopus robot developed by SJTU with dexterous robotic upper body developed (with functions of high payload, forcible entry, excavation, obstacle avoidance and sweeping), a group of jumping robots invented by BU and YSU (with functions of obstacle avoidance) and a swarm of capsule systems invented by BU (with functions of precise positioning, narrow openings maneuveration and manipulation). A bunch of novel wearable and environmental sensors will be assembled and equipped on the robots and firefighter’s protection suits to facilitate the real-time machine-to-machine communications.

This understanding is essential in order to decipher transfers of mass and heat within the crust and related economic issues and seismic hazards. This project is original as it establishes a strong multidisciplinary synergy between field studies, quantitative petrochronology and numerical modelling. The candidate will spend the outgoing phase at the School of Geosciences in Sydney (Australia) and the return phase at Géosciences Montpellier (GM), University of Montpellier (UM, France). Dr Cenki-Tok is associate professor, well versed into naturalistic approaches. Benefiting from an intensive training in numerical modelling by A/Prof P.

1146,208589,No,Multifocal structured illumination optoacoustic microscopy,"Optoacoustic imaging is a highly scalable and versatile method that can be used for optical resolution microscopy (OR-OAM) at superficial  depth yet can be adapted for tomographic imaging with ultrasonic resolution at centimeter penetration scale. However, the imaging speed of OR-OAM is slow as far as concerned with acquisition of volumetric data, which greatly restricts its usage in applications involving dynamic biological processes.     In this MSCA project, we propose to develop a new approach using multifocal structured illumination in conjunction with a spherical ultrasonic array detection to achieve real-time volumetric optoacoustic imaging in both optical and acoustic resolution modes. Several challenges are to be addressed to reach these objectives. Firstly, a multifocal structured illumination system with two identical beamsplitting gratings will be designed and fabricated. Secondly, optoacoustic signal unmixing method for the spherical ultrasonic array detection geometry will be developed and image reconstruction algorithms based on the unmixed signals devised. Thirdly, calibration methods for the proposed system will be investigated. Finally, real-time volumetric optoacoustic imaging will be demonstrated in living animals      With the proposed method, real-time volumetric imaging at multiple penetration scales can be accomplished, making it possible to study dynamic functional, kinetic and metabolism parameters at the cellular, organ and whole organism level. By opening new possibilities for visualization of multi-scale dynamics not attainable with existing imaging modalities, the new method will broadly affect both pre-clinical and clinical imaging in the fields of in vivo cell tracking, targeted molecular imaging, studies of tumor dynamics and neovascularization, functional brain imaging.",0,0
1066,99693,No,Autonomous Control of Large-scale Water Treatment Plants based on Self-Organized Wireless BioMEM Sensor and Actuator Networks,"Recent advances in ICT and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) have led to devices incorporating wireless communication, processing and storage capabilities, as well as diverse sensing and actuation functionalities in a single unit that is compact, economical, autonomous and destined to become ubiquitous. This revolution appears in the form of dense and distributed Wireless Sensor Networks, the potential of which is enormous for various applications that are of great interest to society, including water monitoring and management in large-scale industrial plants, where microbiologic control of water quality is crucial. A basic understanding of system performance limits and the optimal design of large-scale, robust in-network practical algorithms associated with such biological signals remains far from mature. This proposal is motivated by the grand challenge of providing: a) a fundamental understanding of the performance bounds of large-scale Self-Organized Wireless BioMEM Networks (WBNs); b) concrete design guidelines, algorithms, software and hardware architectures to assure the required robustness, fault-tolerance, power efficiency, autonomy and adaptation; c) implementation and deployment of a large-scale and reactive WBN for microbiological autonomous monitoring and decentralized control of water quality in industrial environments. HYDROBIONETS will address: a) the distributed acquisition of spatio-temporal biological signals, including the specific design of BioMEMs and their stable integration to motes; b) in-network cooperative processing and distributed intelligence to achieve essential tasks such as inference, detection, and decision-making; c) networked dense control to ensure adequate water quality, productivity and energy fficiency of water treatment plants.

849,99720,No,Finding order to harness chaos: A new approach to understanding and controlling high Reynolds-number wall-bounded turbulence,"The enormous impact and significance of high Reynolds-number wall-bounded turbulence in various applications ranging from transportation and energy generation systems to meteorology and oceanography cannot be understated. However, almost all existing ideas in modelling and controlling wall-bounded turbulence are based on our limited understanding of low Reynolds-number flows. In higher Reynolds-numbers, we simply assume the existence of mutual independence of the large-scales located farther away from the wall from the small-scales near the wall and vice-versa. However, this notion of independence is incorrect. In fact, multiscale interactions between large- and small-scales play a significant role in various turbulent transport processes in practical situations. Consequently, our predictive models and control schemes that cannot account for or take advantage of these interactions have very limited success. Therefore, the central question posed in this research project is: What is the physics of scale interactions at higher Reynolds-numbers and how do we take advantage of it?  The aim is to explore the essence of scale interactions and develop fundamental understanding by performing novel experiments in high Reynolds-number boundary layers. New control methodologies based upon the existence of interactions between large- and small-scales will be devised and applied to reduce skin-friction drag. Additionally, unconventional, yet highly innovative experiments will be devised to ``simulate' essential aspects of high Reynolds-number scale interactions in a controlled laboratory environment. State-of-the-art laser diagnostics techniques including tomographic PIV and multiple-plane PIV will be performed together with other methods such as hot-wire/laser anemometry to study the physics of scale interactions in these flows. The ultimate goal is to develop new initiatives aimed at predicting and controlling wall-bounded flows in order to meet current and future challenges.",0,0
128,48086,Yes,Sustainable agriculture use of aquifers in southern Europe: integration between agricultural and water management policies,"If the challenges of the future are to be met, major changes in the approach to water resource management are required. One of the major fundamental change required is a shift from preoccupation with increasing water availability toward a more balanced approach which emphasizes conservation and protection of water resources. This proposal is motivated by the fact that all partners are currently carrying on a variety of research activities on definition of sustainability criteria, hydrological and socio-economic modeling, groundwater management, nonpoint source pollution regulation, interactions between agriculture and the environment, analysis of the impacts of CAP and national/local water management policies and practices. The aim is bringing together social and natural scientists, in order:  (a) to comprehensively interpret the interactions between agriculture and groundwater quality in Southern European regions;  (b) to identify sustainable paths of groundwater use;  (c) to identify the role and impacts of CAP as well as alternative agricultural-environrnental policy schemes that could lead to sustainability. As the present proposal is concerned with the concertation of on-going research in many different areas, the work of the C.A. focuses more on the organization of the concertation and the promotion of the execution of individual projects, than on fine-tuning of the research itself The general goal for this C.A. is to stimulate feedback between research teams, to exchange research methods and data, to harmonize different approaches, to identify research priorities. Coordination will be primarily achieved through periodic meetings. Moreover, between meetings, Partners will be encouraged to share available information and results derived from ongoing research activities. All partners are expected to make at least two contributions to published papers during the C.A. period. Intermediate results of workshops will be collected in 3 interim reports.

1125,186923,No,Next Generation Driving Behaviour Models,"Microscopic traffic simulation tools which replicate individual driver decisions and combine them to deduce network conditions are popular tools for evaluating transport planning and management options. An essential component of such tools is a set of mathematical models of driver behaviour, including but not limited to longitudinal movement models, lateral movement models, and route choice models. Driving behaviour is an inherently complex process, with driving decisions being affected by various factors, including network topography, traffic conditions, path-plan of the driver, features of the vehicle and characteristics of the driver. The existing driving behaviour models address many of these factors, either fully or partially. However, the existing models tend to overlook the effect of driver characteristics on the decision framework and ignore the underlying heterogeneity in decision making of different drivers as well as the same driver in different contexts. The behavioural predictions from such models are bound to contain significant noise and implementation of models in traffic micro-simulation tools can lead to unrealistic traffic flow characteristics and incorrect representation of congestion. In this research, we propose to develop dynamic driving behaviour models that explicitly account for the effects of driver characteristics in his/her decisions alongside the effects of path-plan, network topography and traffic conditions.  The models will be calibrated by combining experimental data collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator (UoLDS) and actual traffic data collected using video recordings. The developed models will have the potential to significantly improve prediction capabilities of microscopic traffic simulators and contribute to better transport planning and management.",0,0
520,205222,No,Heterogeneity of Temperature in Rivers and Streams,"River temperature is important to many freshwater fish species which are highly intolerant of temperature extremes. The growing influence of climate change on European rivers means that fluvial organisms are increasingly threatened by high temperatures, and temperature-driven declines in fish populations are already being observed across Europe. Despite this, ecosystems in certain rivers are resilient to climate change due to the presence of alternating warm and cool habitats. Rivers with high thermal habitat heterogeneity will therefore be increasingly important in sustaining fluvial biodiversity in areas affected by climate change, and a better insight into the drivers of river temperature heterogeneity is essential. However, little is currently known about the spatio-temporal variability of river temperature heterogeneity, and understanding both the nature of this variability and its fundamental driving processes remains a key problem in the river sciences. In light of this, the aim of HoTRiverS is to quantify the spatial and temporal scales of thermal heterogeneity in UK rivers and to infer the controls and processes driving these space-time patterns. This research theme will be addressed following four key objectives: 1. Quantify variability in temperature heterogeneity across the UK using thermal infrared remote sensing. 2. Attribute observed patterns of heterogeneity to key landscape properties using a spatial statistical network model approach. 3. Understand how these landscape properties drive water temperature heterogeneity through using deterministic water temperature models to analyse the energy transfers associated with different landscape types. 4. Explore the sensitivity of river temperature heterogeneity to change by modelling future climate and land-use change scenarios.  Through these objectives, we hope to achieve a better understanding of river temperature heterogeneity with a view to preserving critically threatened freshwater habitats.",0,0

Expected Outcome  Low-cost and low-tech water purification systems using constructed wetlands, will be developed for drinking water supply of rural communities and distributed to developing countries in the tropics and subtropics. The systems should be adapted to local surface water contamination (e.g. by algal toxins, heavy metals, agrochemicals, untreated industrial and municipal run off). The results of these studies should provide evidence also to develop long-term strategies for the design and construction of semi-natural wetlands with stable plant-soil bacteria-associations for water improvements at the border of freshwater lakes to rehabilitate eutrophicated aquatic ecosystems and to increase biological diversity.  The key activities envisaged are: * Plant vegetation from swamps in tropical and subtropical areas are selected for effective purification and detoxification capacity to decrease contamination of water of natural lakes to nutrient contents (e.g. phosphorous, nitrogen) of oligotrophical lakes and to a level of contamination (e.g. nitrogen compounds, heavy metals, organic pollutants, cyanobacterial neurotoxins and hepatotoxic peptides, xenobiotics, bacteria) which covers the WHO guidelines for tap water. * Stable plant root-bacteria-associations with specific purification and detoxification capacity are identified by PCR, species-specific gen probes and fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide probes, by analytical standard methods for measuring concentrations of chemical pollutants, and by sensitive strains of duckweed and algae as well as HPLC and ELISA for measuring Cyanobacteria toxins. * Studies on commercializing the shoot biomass produced by the constructed wetlands. * Developing strategies for long-distance transport of water by using renewable natural sources of solar and wind energy.",1,0

Subtle changes in the circulation of the Weddell Sea can lead to major changes in floating ice-shelves, with critical implications for global sea-level, the production of deep water and the global ocean overturning circulation. Despite these critical climate implications, the Antarctic shelf circulation remains poorly understood.   I propose an ambitious project at the crossroads of experimental and numerical oceanography. By drawing on the strengths of each discipline I will explore the regional water-mass pathways in the Weddell Sea: an unchartered cornerstone for understanding the polar ocean circulation and its links to global climate. A key issue facing climate scientists will be addressed: “What sets the tridimensional water-mass structure and pathways in the Weddell Sea and modulates the flow of deep waters between the Antarctica ice-shelves and the global ocean circulation?”  To address this question I propose to investigate several key aspects of the Weddell Sea system: the dynamical forcing of the Weddell gyre and its response to atmospheric variability; the forcing and the circulation on the continental shelf and its interaction with the gyre; and the time-scale and mixing associated with bottom water sinking along the continental shelf. WAPITI approaches these objectives through a series of innovations, including (i) an ambitious field experiment to investigate the shelf circulation and processes, (ii) a powerful conceptual framework applied for the first time to a realistic eddy-resolving model of the Weddell gyre, and (iii) a novel instrument that will be developed to directly observe the sinking of deep water into the abyssal ocean for the first time.

They provide services for the public as well as specific industries and are operated by both municipalities and private organisations.   What, however, appears to be well defined and local objectives to be mastered with mature and proven technology becomes more and more difficult, leading to increasingly frequent situations where the biological sewage treatment process cannot cope with the amount of waste. This can result in untreated waste water flowing into a river, or stopping the production of drinking water because of polluted raw water.  Utility operators are beginning to recognise that they will have to broaden their view to monitoring large areas if they are to understand the interdependencies between pollution sources or environmental conditions such as the weather, and their effects on the control of the treatment process. However, the currently available SCADA systems are not able to deal with such data.  Although techniques and methods to interpret continuous measurement data for current situation assessment, diagnosis, trend detection and decision support are applied for other process industries, the environmental monitoring, management of water resources and waste water effluents, and their effects on very specific biological treatment processes has been widely ignored. Unlike other process industries where insufficient monitoring and control in the worst case leads to diminished profits, bad control and mismanagement of the water resources has an immediate impact on the life of everybody.  Consequently, the objectives of EM2S are to develop and install:  - Regional environmental management systems to provide global real-time information. - Water quality monitoring and assessment methods for providing on-line quality information, allowing automatic, remote and intelligent monitoring stations. - Active decision support for operators to adapt the process control to sudden changes in the environment.  The main focus of EM2S is on the integration of emerging software technologies in a framework that will allow easy interfacing to existing SCADA systems and - through one of the partners - integration in a new generation of such systems for the Water Industry. In particular this implies the use of:  - Advanced algorithms for sensor data fusion and validation such as Kohonen Maps and Fuzzy Logic. - Knowledge-based and case-based reasoning techniques for decision support. - Presentation techniques addressing all levels of users, from operator to authorities. - An agent-oriented software framework integrating these techniques allowing efficient adaptation to and configuration of specific application requirements.  Two applications will be set up in the project to demonstrate and validate the tools and concepts developed. Validation goes beyond technical evaluation of hardware and software: it will provide a clear view on the usability and acceptability by the user, it will indicate the commercial benefits, and it will identify impacts on general regulatory procedures.  The measures for success are reduced down time of the drinking water production processes, more stable and longer living biological treatment processes, reduced communication costs for remote monitoring stations and compliance with increasingly stricter legislation of providing environmental data to the authorities.",1,1

262,90410,Yes,Macroclean - developing novel gel-based technologies for water clean-up,"The management of contaminated groundwater, surface waters and drinking water is a major issue both in the EU and globally, where recent (and historical) industrial, urban and commercial activities have led to the presence of elevated concentrations of a wide range of contaminants in surface- and ground-waters, adversely affecting the health of millions of people. This has been recognised in a number of recent directives (e.g. the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive) aimed at protecting ground and surface water resources within the EU. However, despite much progress, groundwater and surface water quality is still highly variable across Europe, and there is an urgent need to develop and fully implement forward-looking technologies to clean-up water and keep it free from pollution. In this project we intend to combine innovative biomaterial / gel technologies with nanotechnologies to develop and commercialize innovative products for the remediation or clean-up of contaminated ground and surface waters. A range of permeable composite gels in which nanoparticles will be embedded will be produced and tested for application as water clean-up devices.  Achieving the objectives of the project will benefit to all European citizens, economy, agriculture and industry and will place Europe in a leading position in the area of polymer-based remediation devices and technologies. This is an inter- and multidisciplinary proposal, which will offer a top class young researcher great opportunities to develop her existing skills, acquire new skills in the area of materials, environmental science and nanotechnology and, more specifically, in the area of technologies for remediation and clean-up devices, generate new knowledge and obtain training in transferable skills and thus develop a successful career as an independent researcher in the field of environmental science and materials for remediation.",1,1

292,43586,Yes,European energy and water balance monitoring system.,"Objectives  The prime objective is to develop and demonstrate a service for providing national to regional scale energy and water balance products on the basis of METEOSAT. Two participating customers will evaluate the utility of the products for their tasks in the fields of environment and hydrology. External customers will be addressed via the mechanism of the CEO Enabling Services.  Applications  The radiation, actual evapotranspiration and rainfall information that is extracted from METEOSAT data has a variety of applications. For example: filling gaps in meteo networks, regional water balance studies, water distribution planning, modelling the fate of agrochemicals, monitoring of drought, desertification and climatic change impact, crop yield forecasting and early warning, locust pest early warning, initialising weather forecasting models. Actual evapotranspiration has never been available from meteorological networks, but is of utmost importance.  Relevance to EC  'There is a serious lack of baseline data, statistics, indicators and other quantitative and qualitative material required to assess environmental conditions and trends, to determinate and adjust public policies and to underpin financial investments' (Official Journal of the European Community 1993/C138/69). The products of the EWBMS are complementary to CORINE data. The project fits well with the objectives of the CEO programme in the sense that it contributes to a European system for earth observation by stimulating user oriented services.  State of the art  Present state of the art in energy and water balance monitoring is based on results of the ASMODE project (EV5V-CT91-0029). Since 1992 a dedicated METEOSAT receiving station has been put in operation and a number of experimental monitoring products have been produced on a pixel by pixel basis and for timescales varying from one day to a year: cloud top level frequencies, rainfall, surface albedo, net radiation, actual evapotranspiration, relative evapotranspiration, thermal inertia (measure of soil moisture), Budyko Lettau aridity index, desertification index,relative growth of a standard crop, end of season crop yield.  Approach and work content  In this project the earth observation 'service provider' (EARS) is cooperating with two potential 'customers' to evaluate the use of the Meteosat derived energy and water balance data. The role of the data in their decision/productio process is defined and the data requirements are specified. EARS will receive, process, calibrate, deliver and evaluate data products during a period of 2 years. WAU/MD will carry out energy balance measurements at two sites in Spai for calibration and validation. The European Topic Centre on Inland Waters (ETC/IW), belonging to the European Environment Agency (EEA), will apply and evaluate the utility of the data in the framework of their EEA mandate, in particular for the case a water balance assessment of the Danube river basin. CEDEX will carry out similar assessments in Spain. Other customers addressed via the CEO Enabling Services will submit application reports.

319,34932,Yes,WATER MANAGEMENT METHOD FOR NON-CLOSED CROP PRODUCTION,"Background:  In the Southern European countries there is an enormous lack of water. For agricultural purposes one tries to use the available water as efficient as possible. On the other hand, nutrient solved in the irrigation water may leach into ground and surface water.   The objectives are:  The objective of the project is to develop and to do research on a new water management method for non-closed crop production systems. It is based on the concept of keeping the water available for plants in the top layer of the soil, where the plant roots are located. Beneath this layer, there will be an inactive soil layer which acts as a buffer between the root zone and the ground water. The topsoil and the ground water will so hydrologically be disconnected. The open crop production system will thus behave as a 'Virtual closed system for water and fertilisers' avoiding excessive use of limited water resources and leaching of fertilisers.  Short description of the project:  The project will focus on three main targets:  - the development of a multi-point, multiple dielectric sensor to measure water  tension, water content and electric conductivity - the development of an extensive 2-dimensional hydraulic model for water  movement in soil and - the development of 2 algorithms for water management, one for water use   efficiency or water conservation and one for minimum leaching.

812,220333,No,Molecular mechanisms underlying selective neuronal death in motor neuron diseases,"The mechanisms behind neuronal death in different motor neuron diseases (MND) remain unknown. These MNDs include the devastating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A fascinating question in neurodegeneration research is why mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes result in the selective death of a specific neuronal subtype. The ubiquitously expressed and conserved survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein receives its name because its deficit results in MN degeneration. However, SMN known functions -spliceosome assembly and axonal mRNA transport- do not explain the selective MN vulnerability.  Accumulation of intracellular aggregates in neurons is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. The lysosome-autophagy system is the main catabolic pathway for recycling of protein aggregates and damaged organelles, and its role as a quality control system is especially critical in neurons, due to their postmitotic and highly specialized nature. The hypothesis for this proposal is that SMN deficiency leads to a lysosome-autophagy dysfunction which results in a proteostatic failure, underlying MN degeneration. Furthermore, the existing heterogeneity in SMN protein levels across MN populations may determine their probability of survival.  To test these hypotheses we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to genetically engineer human control, SMA and ALS patient-derived iPSCs to generate isogenic and reporter lines that will allow us to study selective neuronal subtypes at a single-cell level. We will also follow an interdisciplinary approach using a SMA Drosophila model to identify new molecular pathways essential for SMN neuropathology. Altogether, my research proposal aims at untangling the molecular mechanisms underlying selective MN death. Our results will open up new directions of research into the molecular basis of neurodegeneration and will provide clues for the design of therapeutics targeting specific neuronal types or phases of MNDs.",0,0
1007,207788,No,Understanding soil fertility impacts on terrestrial biomass production in a changing environment,"The feedback between climate and the land carbon (C) cycle poses one of the largest uncertainties in climate change projections. FIBER targets the unresolved challenge for Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVM) to simulate effects of soil fertility and nutrient deposition on biomass productivity (BP) and the land C balance. Accumulating evidence documents how plants adjust their growth strategies and C allocation under multiple limiting resources. Current DGVMs lag behind these new insights, produce widely diverging results for C cycling and nutrient limitation under future scenarios and fail to explain the observed land C sink. This work will provide a new global modelling approach to simulating flexible plant C allocation following optimality principles. A better understanding of the controls on BP is crucial for assessing climate change impacts on ecosystem services and to reduce uncertainty in C cycle and climate change projections. I will develop a new type of plant growth model to predict increased root growth and export of labile C to soil biota on infertile soils and under low N inputs, consistent with powerful data from forest inventories and ecosystem manipulation experiments. By accounting for trade-offs between different growth strategies and a C cost of nutrient uptake, I will simulate the plant C economy under optimality constraints – a powerful approach, supported by observations but not exploited for DGVMs. The project is conceived to combine the relevant expertise and exploit the pioneering science of leading European researchers with my integrating role and demonstrated model development skills. Collaboration with two secondment hosts will facilitate the mining of their large data resources and fusing data into model predictions using Bayesian statistical tools. This project will integrate new model components developed at my current host institute and will be a crucial step on the way to building the next generation of vegetation models.",0,0

Competitiveness requirements imposing shorter  design cycles put forward the need for a more effective  and reliable approach to the durability optimisation that  makes optimal use of previous experience and similar  designs. This is particularly critical for the truck  industry because many variants are required to satisfy  widely varying market demands.   The main objective of the project is to develop  integrated design tools for durability assessment and  optimisation of trucks, which combine numerical  prediction methods with tests on physical prototypes on  laboratory test rigs and on test tracks in a closely co  ordinated manner.   First, a fatigue strength information system will be  developed that allows to take maximum advantage of a  company's internal durability experience on previous  similar designs. Second. structural modelling techniques  will be developed that allow in the design phase of a  truck to efficiently optimise a component for durability,  without the need for complete recalculation of the  structural model of the truck. Third, tools will be  developed to generate improved, customer oriented but  time reduced loading environments for use in both  numerical predictions and accelerated fatigue testing on  test tracks and test rigs. Finally, tools to improve  quality and effficiency of test rig fatigue testing will  be implemented.   Overall, these elements will be tightly linked and  integrated in order to obtain an efficient concurrent,  CAE/CAT driven design process for durability  optimisation. As structural dynamics (vibrational  behaviour) has an important impact on the fatigue  performance of trucks, a combined fat(igue & d)ynamics  methodology will be implemented in all steps of the  concurrent engineering approach.   The participation of two truck manufacturers (DAF and  RVI) ensures the development of industrially relevant  solutions. For the validation of the different  technologies, extensive endurance testing on test tracks  and test rigs has been planned by both end users. The two  technology and software development SME's (LMS project  coordinator, and TecMath) have a leading position in  their own field of expertise (structural dynamics LMS  and fatigue analysis TecMath), but need to co operate  in order to develop an integrated system for durability  optimisation The expertise of the University of Leuven is  required for a successful solution to the critical  structural modelling problem.   The direct outcome of the project is an integrated  software system for durability optimisation, and will be  commercialised by LMS and TecMath together. Combining  LMS' market position in the world and TecMath's fatigue  expertise, allows to compete against US companies  currently dominating the durability engineering market.   The most important benefit for the truck manufacturers is  the reduction of the most critical path in the  development time of trucks, which is the durability  optimisation. Subsequently, the truck manufacturers will  be able to increase market share by faster adapting their  products to the fast changing market requirements while  maintaining the reliability.",0,0
266,225959,Yes,Water treatment and reuse technology based on constant water quality monitoring thanks to multi-censoring and AI-Deep Learning software for the Food Industry,"Every year in Europe, 3,6 Gm3 of fresh water is used for the food industry. This represent a cost of up to 14,5 G€/year considering both cost of fresh water and water disposal. Depending on the water quality used to wash and process food products, harmful bacteria (e.g. E.Coli, Salmonella, Listeria) can be rapidly contaminate food and expose consumers to serious illnesses. On the other side, around 88 Mtons of food waste are generated annually in Europe with associated costs estimated at 143G€ and carbon footprint of 170Mt of CO2. Current solutions for water recycling are either using old technics such as settling ponds (80% of the market) or recycling industrial systems (20% of the market). They show several important inconvenient such as high ground footprint, low water recovery rate, low contaminant removal rate, high energy consumption, non-automatized system, etc. FOODWATERH2020 is the first fully automatized and compact solution which monitor constantly the water quality thanks to its highly precise multi sensors combined with an embodied IA software based on Deep Learning Technology which allow to: 1) recover up to 99% of food process water, 2) Reduce up to 10 times current costs of food process water (down to 0,40-0,80€/m3), 3) Remove up to 99% of water contaminant such as non-systemic pesticides (from food surface), pathogens, clay and sand, 4) provide a 100% reliability on food safety by always respecting food standards and eliminating food returns to our clients, 5) increase up to 54% the shelf life of food products, 6) Reduce by 30-35% the energy footprint compared to current compact solutions and 7) Reduce the ground footprint up to 20 times compare to ponding systems.

977,107342,No,Actin–membrane anchoring in giant liposomes: a biomimetic system to study cell mechanics,"At the heart of the cell’s ability to maintain its mechanical integrity while dynamically altering its shape is an intimate interaction between plasma membrane and the underlying actin cortex. There is mounting evidence that regulation of actin–membrane anchoring by lipids and dedicated anchoring proteins is critical for the formation of dynamic actin structures needed for essential functions such as cell division, migration, and mechanosensing. The underlying mechanisms are difficult to probe, however, due to the complexity and redundancy of biochemical processes in cells. Here I propose to elucidate how actin–membrane anchoring is involved in cytoskeletal organization and mechanics using a biomimetic model of contractile cells with well-defined composition. I will develop new microfluidic methods to encapsulate active cortical networks of actin and myosin motors in cell-sized liposomes, and I will use an important physiological protein, moesin, to implement actin–membrane anchoring. By combining fluorescence microscopy, micromanipulation techniques, and fluctuation analysis, I will investigate the interplay between actin–membrane anchoring and motor activity in cortical organization and rigidity in a systematic and quantitative manner. Ultimately, I will take the biomimetic approach a step further and investigate the molecular basis of cell adhesion and mechanosensing by incorporating focal adhesion proteins and seeding the biomimetic cells on extracellular matrix substrates. The project will elucidate the basic physical principles behind cell mechanics, which is vital for the development of predictive theoretical models and for understanding cellular shape changes in living organisms. Thus, I expect to obtain valuable molecular insights into diseases associated with malfunction of cytoskeleton–membrane anchoring, most notably cancer. Moreover, the experimental assays will be directly applicable to related fields, such as synthetic biology and membrane technology.",0,0

Determine concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic N (DON), dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved organic P (DOP) in European forest ecosystems, including the transfer of DON, DOC and DOP to surface water. Field-based monitoring studies will be carried out at a set of forested catchments, representative of different environments in Europe. B. Identify key parameters controlling fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and quantify the effects of natural climatic variations. C. Determination of key parameter values with respect to production, mineralisation, sorption and transport of DOM by means of laboratory studies.  D. Further develop and parameterize a mathematical transport model (CHUM) combining the processes, explaining the observed fluxes of natural organic elements in soil (including the transfer to surface water) and quantify the effect of variations in climatic variables.  Dissolved organic matter (DOM), comprising carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP), plays a significant role in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. For example, (i) organic acids act as pH buffer, and bind and transport metals, (ii) dissolved organically-bound forms may contribute significantly to element concentrations, (iii) DON may have a priming effect on soil organic matter decomposition, (iv) certain DOM fractions are a food resource for aquatic organisms, and (v) DOM plays an important role in soil development. There is evidence that climatic factors, especially temperature, moisture and water flux, influence concentrations and fluxes of DOM. Therefore this area of research is essential within TERI.  In PROTOS we propose to determine the effects of natural variations in climate and deposition on concentrations and fluxes of DOC, DON and DOP in forest ecosystems, in a North-South transect across Europe. Results will be used to test hypotheses concerning controlling factors. Specifically, we consider (i) net production, in soil organic horizons, of organic forms of C, N and P that are potentially transferable to solution (ii) physical and chemical processes of sorption and dissolved transport, and (iii) mineralisation of DOM. Of these, the first and third are considered to be influenced most by climatic factors. Proposed field sites are Birkenes (Norway), Waldstein (Germany) and Sierra de Gata (Spain). For each site we have extensive long-term data sets on relevant aspects, which will allow the time-period considered to be extended beyond that of the actual project. A core field programme will include measurement of climatic variables, soil physical properties, and composition of water as it moves through the forest ecosystem. We will also characterize DOM by fractionation and isotopic composition.  Hypotheses concerning the processes mentioned above will be formulated in a mathematical model, which has already been partly developed. Laboratory studies will be done to obtain parameters for sorption, formation of DOM as function of soil temperature, moisture and solution composition, and mineralisation of DON. Driving variables will be climatic data and atmospheric input of water and solutes. The model will be tested by comparing predictions with field observations, including 'hindcasting' of data obtained previously. A successful application of the model to all three sites, which vary widely in climate, will help assessing and predicting the effect of climatic changes on DOC, DON and DOP in European forest ecosystems.  climate, soil, dissolved organic matter production, transport. -  Dissolved organic matter (DOM), comprising carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP), plays a significant role in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. For example, (i) organic acids act as pH buffer, and bind and transport metals, (ii) dissolved organically-bound forms may contribute significantly to element concentrations, (iii) DON may have a priming effect on soil organic matter decomposition, (iv) certain DOM fractions are a food resource for aquatic organisms, and (v) DOM plays an important role in soil development. There is evidence that climatic factors, especially temperature, moisture and water flux, influence concentrations and fluxes of DOM.  In PROTOS we propose to determine the effects of natural variations in climate and deposition on concentrations and fluxes of DOC, DON and DOP in forest ecosystems, in a North-South transect across Europe. Results will be used to test hypotheses concerning controlling factors. Specifically, we consider (i) net production, in soil organic horizons, of organic forms of C, N and P that are potentially transferable to solution (ii) physical and chemical processes of sorption and dissolved transport, and (iii) mineralisation of DOM. Of these, the first and third are considered to be influenced most by climatic factors. Proposed field sites are Birkenes (Norway), Waldstein (Germany) and Sierra de Gata (Spain). For each site we have extensive long-term data sets on relevant aspects, which will allow the time-period considered to be extended beyond that of the actual project. A core field programme will include measurement of climatic variables, soil physical properties, and composition of water as it moves through the forest ecosystem. We will also characterize DOM by fractionation and isotopic composition. Hypotheses concerning the processes mentioned above will be formulated in a mathematical model, which has already been partly developed. Laboratory studies will be done to obtain parameters for sorption, formation of DOM as function of soil temperature, moisture and solution composition, and mineralisation of DON. Driving variables will be climatic data and atmospheric input of water and solutes.

325,218049,Yes,Innovative Network for Training in wAter and Food QUality monitoring using Autonomous SENSors and IntelligEnt Data Gathering and Analysis,"The deterioration of water quality, caused by climatic/seasonal changes, or industrial waste etc. is a major global concern. Over the last decade, water quality observing technology has risen to the challenge of scientists to identify and mitigate poor water quality by providing them with cost-effective tools that can take measurements of essential biogeochemical variables autonomously. Yet, despite these options becoming more readily available, there is a gap between the technology and the end-user (including the investigators and technicians that deploy these technologies) due to a collective lack of training, in-depth knowledge, and skilled workers who can meet new and emerging challenges. There is also a disconnect between data quality, data gathering by autonomous sensors and data analysis, which is a major obstacle, as the sensors are already being deployed (e.g. through buoys, boats etc.). AQUASENSE will address these challenges through 15 early stage researchers (ESRs), who will receive 540 person-month of unparalleled multidisciplinary training in the field of water quality monitoring. Each ESR will be mentored by carefully selected experts from academia and industry in 9 European countries (UK, Germany, Ireland, Serbia, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Austria, Estonia) and will have access to state-of-the-art equipment to develop autonomous sensors for improved data quality. The autonomous underwater robots and drones will be used to improve the data gathering and AI methods will be used to improve the data analysis. Hands-on project training will be supplemented with formal training courses in relevant fields such as new materials, sensors fabrication, wireless communication, system integration, and robotics, and a variety of complementary courses such as IPR, grant writing and exploiting the scientific results. Mobility within the network will ensure exposure to complementary academic and industrial research environments.",0,1

774,29251,No,"Lower cost, higher performance resin transfer moulding (RTM)","A highly mechatronic, computer controlled feedback injection control system was developed which gave increased levels of speed at lower pressures whilst maintaining precise control over mixing conditions and flow. The development of the generic injection technology was in a form capable of dealing with the processing requirements associated with high and low performance resin systems and fibre packs.   The project was split into nine major technical tasks to look at critical performance definition representing three market areas, resin selection, reinforcement selection and development, development of process monitor systems and mechatronic control, resin injection equipment development, evaluation of material selected and equipment development, material performance characterisation, material type specific development and practical validation.   It was concluded that increase levels of speed at lower pressures whilst maintaining precise control over mixing conditions and flow can be met using the developed highly mechatronic, computer controlled feedback injection control system.   The design based on a modular design allowed the optimised injection technology to be validated on three industrially relevant application categories representing different market sectors.   Other conclusions were made regarding the technical and economical viability, based on the work undertaken on the industrial practical validation of the three industrially relevant applications. The project has proved the potential of the developed intelligent resin injection system, each application not only satisfying the relevant performance definition, but also offering significant cost and/or weight advantages.

The goals of the project are (1) to leverage a record of high quality research and association with centres of excellence outside Europe to build effective and lasting contacts with leading researchers and institutions within the European Research Area; (2) to conduct research on the global expansion of European mining firms and institutions at the end of the 19th century, in ways that enable direct comparisons with my earlier work in North America; and (3) to accelerate the process of embedding these research capabilities at m y new institutional home, the University of Manchester in the UK. At the core of the project are striking parallels between the internationalisation of capital-intensive mining in the late 19th century and contemporary patterns of mineral investment. Both periods witnessed a geographical expansion of mining activity as firms scrambled to 'the ends of the earth' to explore and develop mineral deposits. In both periods geologists and engineers fanned out across the globe to probe its remotest corners, the embodiment of a series of exchanges of knowledge, capital, and material (rock samples, instruments, documents) - between core and periphery. The apparent similarities between the globalisation of resource exploration at the close of the 19th and 20th centuries provide an opportunity to conduct a detailed and systematic study of the one of the first economic sectors to 'go global' and, in so doing, to use the vantage point of the past to deepen our understanding of the significance of contemporary processes of globalisation.'",0,0
1175,219673,No,Ekowasher Graffiti Blaster - A Closed-loop system for Environmentally Optimized Cleaning and Decontamination,"The environmental costs of graffiti removal procedures make them far more expensive than the financial estimations may express. An ordinary graffiti removal procedure requires many cubic meters of drinking water. Waste water is spread around contaminating ground water and causing high exposure of humans (especially children) and animals to the hazardous aerosols.  Currently water shortages affect at least 11% of Europeans and in 20 years from now, global water demand is likely to exceed water supply by 40%. As a result, prices for drinking water might significantly rise. The cleaning industry companies are searching for efficient tools that would balance the rising environmental requirements with their economic efficiency.  Ekowasher Sweden AB offers an unique closed loop system where the residual products are separated and the wash water is purified by a combination of filters and reused.  The water consumption of the Graffiti Blaster is almost zero. Through the specially designed washing nozzles, various surfaces of different porosity can be washed. As the washing water is collected and recycled inside the Graffiti Blaster, the risk of contaminating pollutants being spread by the wash water and the wind is minimized. The Graffiti Blaster’s environmental performance surpasses all other market-available solutions.  In this project we will conduct a deeper analysis of the technical feasibility and of potential ergonomic improvements of the Graffiti Blaster. We will identify the necessary adjustments required for further expansion of the Graffiti Blaster across other industries and market segments. We will conduct an economic feasibility assessment that will indicate the perspectives of entering foreign markets. Moreover, we will investigate business opportunities that may appear through a wider adaptation of our innovation by exploring other segments of the cleaning, decontamination and removal industry.",1,0

The idea is simply based on nanomaterial ingestion and subsequent “silkene” spinning by silkworms. Silkene is expected to be significantly stronger and tougher that its natural counterpart. Since silk produced by silkworms has already impacted our society, the impact of SILKENE project could also be significant.

643,218086,No,Nineteenth-Century Sociographic Journalism and the Formation of Ethnographic and Sociological Knowledge,"This project enacts cutting-edge perspectives on the multigenre history of sociological and anthropological reasoning. It represents the first comprehensive study to investigate pieces of nineteenth-century sociographic journalism as formative frames/catalysts of social knowledge and science. These social sketches (often referred to as panoramic literature) provide rich ethnographic micro-analysis and often relate to debates held by statisticians, moralists, folklorists, and ethnologists. However, in the discipline-oriented histories of the social sciences and humanities, journalism has been ignored as a form of knowledge and as a founding genre of modern (disciplinary, academic) social science. By exploring the epistemic significance of sociographic journalism, the project promises to institute a cross-genre, transdisciplinary, and transnational historiography of the evolution of social knowledge and to revise mono-disciplinary and Eurocentric tales of the past and present.  The project has five kinds of outcome: a series of essays, a conference, a public exhibition, a volume, and two monographs. The corpus comprises social sketches and examples of related knowledge frames (travel accounts, philanthropic reports, caricatures etc.) from Western Europe, the German-speaking countries, and (post-)colonial Latin America. The project develops an innovative mix of anthropological/historiographical approaches to examine (1) the representational techniques of sociographic journalism (e.g., methods of constructing social types, the influence of scientific paradigms); (2) how it connects with epistemic developments (e.g., towards materialist and historicizing conceptions of society); (3) its embeddedness in socio-spatial settings and its relations to academic, artistic, and governmental projects; and (4) how the journalistic sketches are to be situated against processes of urbanization, cultural transfer, nation-building, and the institutionalization of academic disciplines.",0,0
560,87995,No,Development of Self-lubricating Nanocomposite Coatings impregnated with in-situ formed MoS2 for Tribological Applications,"Use of self-lubricated coatings in dynamic contacting parts of the system not only reduces complexity, weight, and cost to the system, but also improves the performance to a great extent by reducing friction and wear. Unlike liquid lubricants, the release of various toxic and harmful chemicals to the environment can also be avoided. So, a self-lubricated surface with a long lifetime is a promising one to meet future challenges. The most common solid lubricants are graphite and transition metals layered dichalcogenides, among which MoS2/WS2 has a great prominence. In this proposal, electrodeposition of Co-W alloys impregnated with MoS2 and WC nanoparticles will be carried out to form nanocomposite coatings by a low cost electrodeposition process. The idea is to impart high hardness and mechanical strength by WC particles for wear resistance; and self-lubrication property by MoS2 particles to a Co-W matrix. Firstly, unlike ELECTROLYTIC CO-DEPOSITION from suspensions of MoS2 nanoparticles, here, emphasis will be on the in-situ formation of MoS2 particles in the electrical double layer followed by their incorporation into Co-W alloys during electrolytic reduction process. Secondly, R&D efforts will be directed to co-deposit WC particles from suspensions along with MoS2 to make self-lubricated wear-resistant nanocomposite coatings. The detailed mechanistic study of MoS2 nucleation and growth; the surface and structural characterization of the nanocomposite coatings, wear and friction property and corrosion will be investigated to understand the structure property correlation. Thirdly, the electrodeposition of Co-W\WC\IF-MoS2 nanocomposite coatings will be carried out from electrolytic suspensions of WC and IF-MoS2 nanoparticles, and the properties will be compared with the former nanocomposites.  A special attention will be given on the onset of an implementation of this technology into industrial practice.",0,0
338,109967,Yes,Ve-Wa:Vegetation effects on water flow and mixing in high-latitude ecosystems–Capability of headwater catchments to mediate potential climate change,"'Our ability to predict consequences of climate change on the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water resources in high-latitude uplands is a formidable challenge. These regions are highly sensitive to climate induced changes as small differences in temperature determine the status of frozen ground, the state of precipitation, and the magnitude and timing of snow accumulation and melt. Recent findings in mid-latitude regions suggest that there exist “two water worlds” – mobile water expressed in the stream and tightly bound water represented by plant water – which means that a substantial proportion of precipitation that infiltrates the soils becomes isolated from discharge to the streams, indicating that the composition of stream water alone is insufficient to understand routing and transit times of water in catchments. These findings challenge the core assumptions in our perceptual models of how we think biophysical systems work and how we make predictions of water partitioning of how inputs of water are evaporated, stored and reach the streams. High-latitude headwater catchments are characterised by lower evapotranspiration, consequent lower soil moisture deficits and different seasonality than mid-latitude sites. This interdisciplinary proposed project will address novel questions on vegetation-water linkages by using isotopic tracers in different waters as 'fingerprints' across different spatial scales along a climate gradient as a precursor to understand future response to change in high-latitude upland catchments. The proposed project will – for the first time - examine the mechanisms of water storage, transmission and release and possible implications of climate change in high-latitude ecosystems along a cross-regional transect. Such geographically extensive comparison has never been conducted in these environments. This allows the consistency of processes and drivers to be assessed across broad spatial scales.'",0,1
975,107843,No,Trade-offs in immunity in the metal hyperaccumulator Noccaea caerulescens,"Metal hyperaccumulating plants are able to accumulate exceptionally high concentrations of metals, such as Zinc, Nickel, and Cadmium, in their shoots to levels that would be toxic to most other plant species. The trait of metal hyperaccumulation has evolved independently multiple times in the plant kingdom. Since this trait is of high importance to bioremediation and biofortification strategies, intensive research efforts aim to decipher the underlying molecular processes. However, although our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in metal uptake and tolerance has improved, not much is known about the processes that have led to the evolution of metal hyperaccumulation in plants. Recent studies have provided new insight into the ecological and evolutionary significance of this trait by showing that the metal hyperaccumulating plant Noccaea caerulescens can use high concentrations of accumulated metals to defend itself against attack by pathogenic microorganisms. Interestingly, infected N. caerulescens plants show none of the inducible defence responses that are used by most plants to provide protection against infection, which suggests that it relies on accumulated metal for disease resistance. The fact that these plants have evolved the ability to uptake and store metals in their shoot tissue, but have in turn lost defences common to most plants suggests a trade-off in expressing both traits. This project aims to study the evolutionary, ecological and functional processes involved in the gain of metal hyperaccumulation and loss of other defensive traits in N. caerulescens. Responsible genes will be identified using phenotyping and RNAseq technology and these candidate genes will be further analysed through evolutionary approaches. The project will provide new insights into the evolution and ecology of metal hyperaccumulation and contribute to the understanding of how plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress may be connected on the molecular level.",0,0

It is a group of complementary facilities for the development, characterisation and qualification of (aero)space materials and technologies located at the Research Centre Seibersdorf. These facilities, partly highly specialised, developed and designed by Seibersdorf, are used for in house R&D programs, mainly conducted for customers like ESA, as well as national and international (aero)space industries. Therefore the Seibersdorf staff is well familiar with the characteristics of (aero)space relevant materials and technologies regarding expertise, methodology, ensuring an efficient support to research teams and individual researchers using the AMTT. The expertise available on methodology and materials science is reflected by a number of already established competence centres of the facility, like the centre of competence for micro- characterisation for Austrian lndustries, the centre of competence on light weight materials and, most important, the ESA materials testhouse. Especially the latter facility demonstrates the high standard of methodology and the essential function of an independent testhouse performing unbiased characterisation and qualification programs.  The AMTT facility will comprise the following complementary test facilities: Space specific properties (thermal cycling, sublimation and redeposition, outgassing of materials under space environment, cold welding and friction under space environment) Microstructure (optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, glow discharge optical spectroscopy, electron & ion microprobes. ultrasonic NDT analysis) ; Thermophysical properties (14000C- 20000C) (therma conductivity, thermal diffusivity, specific heat, thermal expansion, emissivity) Mechanical properties (tensile, compression and bending tests up to 11000C, creep, fatigue) Corrosion behaviour (stress corrosion test, salt spray test, climatic test) Chemical composition (emission spectrography, atomic absorption spectroscopy, gaschromatography). L It should be noted that materials technology developments cannot be made at a single large scale facility but need a pool of high level complementary facilities. The same is true for aerospace technology development and testing of integrated instruments and devices. The availability of a multidisciplinary testing and qualification facility should help to promote innovation in aerospace industry.  The proposed AMTT comprises test facilities of high standard, some of them regarded as rare and in specific aspects | unique (outgassing and sublimation, tribology and cold welding, complete HT- thermophysics). Their concentration, | combination and application to space technology however is regarded as definitely unique in Europe.  Quantity of access being offered and number of users who may benefit: Quantity of access: 25 researchers for 1 - 2 months / year, which corresponds to <10% of the whole activities. Number of users: 75 for full period  The users will be representative for European industries and institutes working on the field of Aeronautics. Special emphasis shall be given to initiate cooperations between institutes and industries and to increase competitiveness of Aerospace Industry. So the implementation and common use of the proposed large scale facility is completely in line with the goals of the Aeronautics Task Force of the Commission of the European Communities started on 1 March 1995 (reference SEC(96) 458 and SEC(95) 1824) for the strengthening the European Aeronautics by a number of actions, - e.g. investment at an European scale not feasible for any single firm or Member state, - a continued supply of qualified and trained young people, - processes for collaboration between firms or a communications infrastructure and services.

Significant social and economical impacts are associated with changes of water quality in inland waters. It is almost impossible to think, in the 21st Century, that water industries and governments would produce sustainable economic and ecological development plans on water without reasonable information on hand. Accordingly, an increasing demand from water industries, including aquaculture, water construction or dam operators, insurers, development banks and water agencies on actual or long-term historic water related information is observed.   The eoFRESH service responds to the increasing demand with an independent multi-satellite based monitoring solution, as only traditional in-situ methodologies are capable neither to retrieve historic information, nor to provide actual harmonized information for a huge number of inland waters. eoFRESH combines the monitoring capabilities of an increasing number of historic, actual and future satellite missions, allowing nowadays up to daily global observations and going back in time for 30 years for millions of water bodies and rivers globally. eoFRESH starts with the provision of relevant globally harmonized water quality measures (e.g. turbidity and related suspended matter, phytoplankton concentration). The service is characterised by three key features: Independency with globally harmonized and valid and consistent measures, extremely cost-efficiency through fully automated production on free accessible satellite missions, extremely easy information uptake through access from web-services and applications.  Within the Phase 1 feasibility study it is the core intention to summarize all the necessary information, including technical and economic aspects which are relevant to provide a sound roadmap to bring the eoFRESH service to the market.",1,1

In order to keep a leading position in the field of nuclear energy – both in terms of safety and efficient use of natural resources – Europe needs to reinforce its expertise and to prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers who will be able to contribute to develop actinide management strategies based on sound scientific bases. However, because most actinides are radioactive, their study requires specific tools and facilities that are only available in a small number of laboratories in Europe. It is therefore strategic to coordinate the major facilities available in Europe, and to strengthen the community of European scientists working on actinides.

The nano-biosensor array will integrate a set of nano-transducers, each of which will consist of two functionalised metal nano-electrodes with an olfactory receptor monolayer anchored in between. In order to reach this objective we will follow a cross-disciplinary approach in nano-lithography, microelectronics, biochemistry and biotechnology. In the recent years important advances in biotechnology and nano-technology have taken place, opening a way to the development of single bio molecule-based nano-biosensors. These nano-biosensors will represent the ultimate limit in miniaturisation, specificity and sensitivity, and would constitute the closest bio-electronic mimic of the animal sensing systems. In the present RTD project we explore the possibility to develop the first olfactory nano-biosensor array based on the electrical properties of single olfactory receptors. The nano-biosensor array will integrate a set of nano-transducers, each of which will consist of two functionalised metal nanoelectrodes with an olfactory receptor monolayer anchored in between. In order to reach this objective we will follow a cross-disciplinary approach in nano-lithography, microelectronics, biochemistry and biotechnology.  OBJECTIVES The overall objective of the project is to explore the possibility to develop a nano-biosensor array based on the electrical properties of single olfactory receptors. The nano-biosensor array will integrate a set of nano-transducers, each of which will consist of two metal nano-electrodes with an olfactory receptor monolayer anchored in between. The main objective will be achieved through the following partial objectives: (i) the fabrication of low resolution nano-electrodes; (ii) the expression and purification of a sufficient number and amount of olfactory receptors; (iii) the elaboration and transfer of monolayers of olfactory receptors on the metal nano-electrodes; (iv) the characterisation and modelling of the electric properties of single olfactory receptors, (v) the determination of olfactory receptor-odour couples, and; (v) the design of a very low noise amplifying readout interface.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The project will develop research in essentially four lines: (i) the production of the olfactory receptors and the elaboration of stable monolayers containing them; (ii) the fabrication of metal nano-electrodes and the anchoring of olfactory receptors monolayers in between (nano-transducer) ; (iii) the characterisation of the electrical properties of single olfactory receptors and; (iv) the characterisation of the nano-transducers as elementary nano-biosensors and their integration in an array biosensor. We will start with olfactory receptors for which at least one ligand is know. At a later stage we will consider extracting olfactory receptors from a rat olfactory epithelium expression library so as to determine their odorant ligands, or even engineering the sequences of olfactory receptors. The stable monolayers containing olfactory receptors will be formed either from purified olfactory receptors solubilised in a detergent or by incorporating them into a lipid membrane. The immobilisation will be enhanced with specific antibodies covalently bound on the nano-electrodes. The fabrication of the nano-electrodes will be carried out by means of NanoImprint Lithography, assisted by Electron Beam Lithography and Reactive Ione Etching. The electrical characterisation of single olfactory receptors will be performed by means of both a specifically designated atomic force microscope and by means of the nano-transducers, and will be assisted by the development of appropriate theoretical models. The feasibility of the nano-transducers as nano-biosensors will be based on the changes in the electric properties of single olfactory receptors when an odour molecule is bound. The corresponding detection curves for given couples of olfactory receptor-odour will be established. Finally, by implementing a set of nano-biosensors in a nano-biosensor array specific product detection will be essayed. Appropriate very low noise amplifiers will be used.",0,0
287,217435,Yes,Application of Microbial Fuel Cells for waste water treatment,"The importance of water for human life is irrefutable. However, it exists a real threat to global water quality due to the pollution generated from residential, industrial and commercial origins. Nowadays, the social trend is to move towards a circular economy to replace the conventional ‘take-make- consume and dispose’ model of growth, where water recycling will play a significant role. Currently the annual world demand for fresh water is 64 bn m3, where just about 7.1 bn m3 comes from recycling due to the high cost of the technologies for wastewater treatment. The need to reuse water along with the scarcity of water has encouraged the development of new water treatment systems to satisfy the growing demand. ÆNEAM aims at launching to the market a green, versatile and efficient process for the industrial synthesis of biocompatible ceramic scaffolds materials for their use in wastewater treatment. Our system will reduce the energy demand, reducing the generation of sludge with a minimum maintenance. Nevertheless, we still need to carry out full operational test to validate our solution for its subsequent commercialization. In addition, we need to forge commercial agreements with strategic partners to guarantee our presence into the market. Our market, the Agroindustry global wastewater treatment market, was valued at €1.7 bn in 2017, and its forecast is to grow at a CAGR of 5.35% from 2018 to 2023. Based on our commercialization plan we will offer our solution to the rural environment companies of the agro industrial sector, which will include not only the sale of MEMBio, but also maintenance and consultancy services. Following our business strategy, we establish an average price of 1,000€/unit for industrial membranes, and 300€/unit for research purposes. Based on the profitability of the project we expect a cumulative revenue of €14.2 M by the third year, meaning a cumulative cash flow of € 7.2 M. Considering a 3-years forecast will give us a ROI of 294%.",1,1
1219,107098,No,Precise Predictions for Higgs and New Physics Signals with Jets at the Large Hadron Collider,"'Many of the Higgs and new physics searches at the Large Hadron Collider involve signals with jets of energetic hadrons. This proposal will improve the theoretical predictions for such processes, focusing on three different aspects:  1) Since backgrounds depend on the number of jets, search analyses are often separated into bins with a particular number of jets to improve sensitivity. I propose to improve the precision of these exclusive jet cross sections, through a next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order calculation using the N-jettiness event shape. Improved predictions for the benchmark W\N jet process and the Higgs\N jet signal will be obtained in a form that is suitable for reweighting Monte Carlos. The latter is important for constraining the couplings of the observed new particle at the LHC, which will help establish whether it is the Higgs boson.  2) Given the excellent performance of the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC, there is an expanding interest in techniques that exploit the substructure of jets. I aim to obtain an analytic understanding of the behavior of jet substructure observables and test Monte Carlo simulations, which do not include higher order effects and are the most common tool for substructure analyses. Substructure observables that will be considered include: jet mass, jet charge, 3-subjettiness (relevant for boosted top quarks) and mass-drop/filtering. I propose to investigate the factorization and resummation of these techniques, as well as their calculation beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy of the Monte Carlo parton shower.  3) I also proposes to calculate the collinear radiation in a jet at next-to-next-to-leading order, fully differential in the three body phase-space. This will be used to test at this order the exponentiation of logarithms from jet algorithms, which 'group' the observed radiation into jets. These results are also an important ingredient in other higher-order calculations for processes with jets.'",0,0
636,101921,No,Glazing Behaviour In a Fire Environment,"The breakage of glass pane during a fire could influence the fire behaviour due to the change from impermeable barriers to large ventilation sources, resulting in the occurrence of the dangerous backdraft phenomena or post flashover flames emerging outside of the openings leading to rapid fire spread to other floors and in the most severe cases even to adjacent buildings.     The project will address the thermally induced stress response of glass to the heat fluxes from fire. Two separable physical processes will be considered. The first is heat transfer from the fire and hot gases to the glass and the second is the development of thermal stresses due to the temperature difference in the exposed area of the glass from the part shielded by the frame. The later often lead to development of cracks and eventually the fracturing of the glass.     The key objectives are as follows:   - Develop a radiation heat transfer model for accurate prediction of temperature and heat flux distributions on the glass.   - Develop a model for predicting the times to the formation of the first crack and all subsequent cracks important to glass pane fall-out.  - Couple the above model with an existing CFD code to achieve combined prediction of fire loading and the occurrence of the cracks.  - Develop and validate a brittle material fracture mechanics model to capture the propagation of the cracks.   - Quantify the effects of window scale and aspect ratio, glass thickness, incident heat flux intensity and distribution, and pressure differential on the formation and propagation of cracks in small, medium and large scale furnaces.  - Determine from laboratory tests a probable fall-out range in terms of the number, size and distribution of the cracks required to isolate pieces of the glass pane from the frame.  - Develop and validate a coupled CFD and fracture mechanics model for predicting a probable window fall-out range in terms of the number, size and distribution of?",0,0
65,40082,Yes,Assessment of the regional impact of droughts in Europe,"The demand for European Water Resources has increased from 100 km3 per annum in 1950 to 550 km3 per annum in 1990, with forecasts that this will increase to 660 km3 by the end of this Century (EEA, 1995). Such increase will, undoubtedly, result in future conflict between human demands (commercial, social & political) and ecological needs, most critically in periods of severe and extensive droughts. It is essential that techniques are developed to assess the frequency of droughts in European rivers and how these may change in the 21st Century.  The 'Fight against Water Deficits' has been identified by the Task Force: Environment Water and this will be addressed by ARIDE by carrying out a pan European Study focusing on three key objectives. The first, is to understand the processes which control droughts with special emphasise on rainfall regimes, weather pattern and groundwater regimes. The second, is to develop methods for estimating the spatial distribution of drought statistics on an European scale. The third, is to develop techniques to predict the relative impact of future environmental change including climate variability and land use change. ARIDE will be supported by the UNESCO/FRIEND (Flow Regimes from International Experimental and Network Data) project which includes representatives of UNESCO, WMO, the European Environment Agency and the National IHP committees of European countries. ARIDE will have full access to the European Water Archive - a database of daily flow series and thematic data from 4,000 European rivers which has been established by the FRIEND project.  The objectives will be achieved by developing a consistent method for defining and analysing the temporal and spatial characteristics of European droughts. The analysis of regional drought characteristics, the development of a regional drought distribution model and a detailed process analysis using meteorological input data will be the basis to determine the relationship between drought severity and frequency in different regions of Europe. This will be complemented by developing relationships between droughts and climatic, geological (drought response index, groundwater recharge) and land use parameters. The model will be used to carry out a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of changing rainfall and land use on the spatial and temporal probability distribution of  hydrometeorological, surface water and groundwater droughts.  There will be two key deliverables of the ARIDE project. First, the result of a sensitivity analysis which will demonstrate the impact of environmental change on European droughts. Second, a software package which will provide a suite of methods which can be used subsequently by the European Water Industry to estimate the relative importance of different aspects of environmental change on European water resources.",1,1

An essential output of this project will be to create an interoperable platform on N topics to a large public including academics and stakeholders, and to increase the awareness of challenges, risks and chances for a better N management in Africa. According to the “Melbourne Declaration on Responsible Nitrogen Management for a Sustainable Future” (December 2016), “Nitrogen management should strive to simultaneously improve the efficiency of nitrogen use, increase farm productivity, enhance soil health, conserve resources and reduce losses of reactive nitrogen to the environment”. The INSA network will bring its contribution to this great subject of study, and participate to drive the development of a preliminary N assessment in Africa. Many international networks of scientists already exist between countries inside and outside Africa. However, for the first time, it is proposed to link these activities in a large and sustainable network to enhance high quality and multidisciplinary research focused on nitrogen in Africa. This network will gather scientists from Europe and Africa working on ecology, atmospheric chemistry, water quality, soil science, biogeochemistry, agriculture and livestock. The interdisciplinary competences of the groups involved in INSA will help in developing innovative aspects of research on targeted questions, to sustain a dialogue between different communities of researchers, to transfer information to the public and to reinforce educational activities. Education and information sharing with a large public will help to disseminate the message of how a sustainable use of nitrogen in our environment is the key action to mitigate harmful impacts while assuring food security.",0,0

Innovative technologies for submarine springs, from survey using an autonomous underwater vehicle, monitoring at the spring level till capture prototype, will be developed mainly in this project. Economical and environmental study of submarine springs will be conducted and taken into consideration.Submarine springs study will also be used to determine the real water resource potential at the coastal karst aquifers in three Mediterranean catchments. The submarine springs could repres ent important alternative water resource as it has been reported during the last 30 years, but without serious scientific arguments. New technology for characterising the submarine springs will help to infirm or confirm this hypothesis. Low cost and low energy desalination plants for temporary use and salinity variability of submarine springs water will not be developed within MEDITATE, but designed based on feasibility analysis. A general analysis of desalination cost for various conditions will be taken into account in the socio-economic analysis for the management system. In the same manner, a review of water reuse will be carried out, taking into consideration environmental and health problems, technical and cost problems in order to have serious data to be considered in water management scenarios. The water management support system will bring stakeholders in a decision making process considering water visions for 2025. The WMSS will provide set of scenarios, giving safe water yield, based on the cha racterisation and hydrological modelling of four catchments. This WMSS will allow integrating different types of knowledge inclusive all social actors, in a decision-making process.",1,1
597,206485,No,From fast food to healthy diet: Addressing the dynamic molecular mechanism of sequential diet switch-induced T cell plasticity for the purpose of developing new treatments for immuno-mediated diseases,"'The incidence of chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is continually increasing. Chronic inflammation has been linked to intestinal carcinogenesis, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The cause of this increase could be the unprecedented dietary abundance typical of “Western” countries. Different types of diets shape the genetic composition and metabolic activity of human intestinal microorganisms; microbiota. There is a continuous cross talk between the microbiota and the immune system. For these reasons, the hypothesis that a “bad” diet promotes a chronic state of intestinal inflammation by shaping the microbiota and in turn carcinogenesis could be supported. However, this hypothesis and whether this is a reversible process remain to be tested.   It has recently been shown that the composition and metabolism of the microbiota is plastic and it can be rapidly “reprogrammed” by switching to a healthier diet. This plastic behaviour has also been attributed to T helper cells. We have shown that Th17 cells, originally thought to be a stable T helper linage, can convert into a more pathogenic phenotype contributing to chronic inflammation or can acquire regulatory functions promoting the resolution of the inflammation.   This project aims to reveal whether mouse and human Th17 cells can quickly adapt to the microbiota as the microbiota does to the diet and in turn mediate the diet effects. By using a unique set of sophisticated transgenic mice we will also test whether the immune system can be corrected by a “simple” change in diet – a widely held belief not yet substantiated.   Studying the potential 'synchronized ballet' of the diet and the immune system will reveal both the enormous dynamism and the revolutionary therapeutic opportunities intrinsic to T cell biology. This project will furthermore identify molecular targets for pharmacological treatments to reverse inflammatory diseases when a simple diet change no longer suffices.'",0,0
1041,97307,No,Coastal Research Network On Environmental Changes,"Coastal wetlands experience dramatic changes as a consequence of temperature increase, sea level rise, or nutrient accumulation. This has raised great concern about the future fate of such systems, their functioning and services. Conservation policies are in need of new approaches in order to understand the complex feedback mechanisms driving organismic responses to environmental changes, and improving our capability to forecast future changes in higher hierarchical levels of the ecosystems. The CREC consortium will address these issues by investigating: (i) effects of interacting environmental drivers, (ii) combined changes in biotic interactions, and (iii) feedback loops between hierarchical levels within ecological systems. We selected mangroves as our core topic since these wetlands are particularly threatened by environmental changes but provide multiple functions to be conserved in the future. Nevertheless, the research techniques applied in the working packages will form an ecological know-how that scientists will easily transfer to other ecosystems including European ones. This will significantly improve both, the strength and impact power of the applying consortium, and the scientific base for conservation, rehabilitation and management of coastal ecosystems. The CREC network brings together 9 participants from 3 European countries and 5 Third countries. The network builds on a strong base of already established co-operations but will also provide new cross-links of expertise on empirical, theoretical, and applied aspects of wetland research. In this frame, the merging of ecophysiological research and computer modelling is seminal and strategically important for the development and implementation of innovative and scientifically sound technologies for coastal conservation and environmental management. The CREC research activities are thus in agreement with the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the World Summit on Sustainable Development.",1,0

This includes : * comparing existing practices of water management (irrigation, drainage) in the three deltas, * evaluating their consequences on economic efficiency and on constraints for further land development, * identifying conditions and results of one common pattern of diversification (poldered raised beds system), * propose new patterns of water management. Expected Outcome  The concrete achievements should include models for water management in the deltas, an improved efficiency of water distribution, feasibility of change in water allocation and management, with water saving, the assessment of the causes and consequences of the agricultural diversification, and a complete set of technical references on raised beds systems. A special attention will be paid in the project to design ' easy to understand ' IEC (Information, Education and Communication) documents. This joint project constitutes the cornerstone of a regional network on deltaic agriculture. The key activities will include three research packages : * The first package will deal with comparing different water management institutional designs that do exist (or have existed in the recent past) in the three deltas, at studying the interaction between actors in the successive levels of decision found along the water chain and at evaluating the water cost according to the different designs that have been identified: definition of the respective powers and responsibilities of the institutions involved, impact on financial issues, particularly the calculation of the water tax. * The second component of the research aims at understanding hydraulic interrelations between different sub-areas inside a global water management unit and at building models of hydraulic functioning. A related objective is to identify a number of changes in the water management in some sub-areas that better satisfy local needs without not affecting those of other sub-areas.  * The last package will aim at characterising the different technical patterns of one major land development presently being spreading (or having spread in the recent past), namely raised beds technique, specifying its features regarding water management, in terms of quantity and quality, identifying the conditions of its profitability for various kinds or groups of actors.",1,1
260,52707,Yes,Biotechnical treatment and recycling of textile processing effluents,"Project aims at developing of enzyme and microbial based biotechnical processes for treatment and recycling of dyehouse effluents to improve competitivity of European textile industry against Far East countries by using new, eco-efficient technologies with less environmental impact resulting in lower environmental costs. With regard to quantity, textile finishing industry is the most important effluent discharger compared to other branches. Present sewage treatment mainly is end of pipe technique, where mixed waste water is treated. Especially dyehouse effluents contribute to effluent charges making them the most cost-intensive waste water of textile industry. Biotechnical treatment and recycling of those partial waters is more effective than of mixed effluents. Implementation of biotechnical methods into treatment of textile effluents will save water resources, minimise effluent, improve quality of work, thus save EU as textile production site. Work performed: The project was started with the monitoring of representative textile dyehouse effluents and with the set up of data bases. Microbial and enzyme activities with dye decolorizing potential were screened and produced in laboratory scale. Based on the monitored data defined model effluents were produced for degradation studies. Different enzymatic, microbial and combined chemical means for their degradation or modification were evaluated. Equipment for physical effluent treatment was set up; -Achievements to date: Prerequisite to achieve the overall objectives of the project is the monitoring and detailed characterization of the effluents from different textile finishing lines. This process data is now available. Process related emission factors deliver details about the amount of waste water in a distinct process per kg of textile substrate. For every process, the amount of effluent was related to the recipe of the process and the amount of textile substrate. Knowledge of these factors will enable the estimation of mass flows for the developed processes. Biotechnical means with high dye decolorization potential have been screened and produced in lab-scale and industrial scale. Successful physical separation techniques have been set up. Reuse of the biotechnicalls and physically treated effluent is feasible. Quality of the dyed material is comparable to reference material dyed by using fresh water.",1,1

Throughout a varied set of activities, the project will allow transfer of knowledge and the training of the FF, thus improving his employability and career perspectives. Interdisciplinary in nature, DAM-NET will draw upon insights from International Relations (IR), nationalism studies and political geography to create a framework for the analysis of the politics of mega-dams. Specifically, two case studies – the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia and the Rogun Dam (RD) in Tajikistan – will serve as a platform to analyse the discursive constructions surrounding mega-dams, and to map and unpack stakeholder and elite networks associated with the water sector in both countries.

Smart communicating devices with their sensing, computing and control capabilities promise to make our cities, transportation systems, factories and living environments more intelligent, energy-efficient, safe and secure. This extremely complex system has raised a number of new challenges involving ICT disciplines. In particular, a novel peer-to-peer distributed computational model is appearing as a new opportunity in which a service is built-up cooperatively by peers, rather than by a unique provider that knows and owns all data. The interdisciplinary “Optimization Community” is facing this revolution sharing a common need: to find new theories, methodologies and tools to optimize over this complex network system. With this in mind, OPT4SMART has a twofold objective. First, to provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to solve distributed optimization problems over peer-to-peer networks. Second, to develop effective numerical tools, based on this framework, to solve estimation, learning, decision and control problems in cyber-physical networks. To achieve this twofold objective, we will take a systems-theory perspective. Specific problems from these four areas will be abstracted to a common mathematical set-up, and addressed by means of interdisciplinary methodologies arising from a synergic combination of optimization, controls, and graph theories. In particular, OPT4SMART will face the challenge of solving optimization problems under severe communication limitations, very-large-scale problem and data size, and real-time computational constraints. The expected result will be a combination of strong theoretical methods and effective numerical toolboxes available to people in Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics and other areas, who are facing optimization in cyber-physical networks.",0,0
124,51743,Yes,Liquid rate flowmeter for the oil industry,"The measurement of hydrocarbon production from a well is mainly required for field management. In well testing the presence of natural gas and water leads to a multiphase mixture whose composition and flow rate must be monitored.

The requirements of reversible sorption processes and sufficient compatible milieu for bacteria are met by the use of organ clays. The combined use of bacteria and andorganoclay under static conditions has been investigated in detail recently. The main focus will lie on column techniques under flow conditions based on interactions between organically/aquifer mixtures, chloroaromaticcompounds and bacteria. Development of mixtures of organ clays and aquifer material as a packing material having both a significant sorption capacity for chloroaromatic compounds and a sufficient hydraulic conductivity, because of the low hydraulic conductivity of pure organ clays. Because particularly attention has tube turn on the compatible milieu for bacteria, one of the main training objectives for Time Pertness is an extended introduction in the field of microbiological aspects of soil remediation. Particularly the aspects of controlled microbial degradation of organic contaminants in soils or aquifers are of importance in order to complete her previous experiences from her PhD work in soil remediation based on sorption processes andphotooxidation.

88,52180,Yes,Systems approach to environmentally acceptable farming,"Problems to be solved Rising concern about agricultural non-point water pollution has led to propose many regulatory measures. Agri-environmental programmes have been implemented in the different EU Member States according to the Commission regulation 2078/92. Best management practices (BMPs), one of the most popular tools, have rarely been assessed in a fully satisfying way yet. This project aims at providing planners with a grid that would allow a comparison between BMPs in terms of environmental efficiency, economic cost and potential acceptability by farmers. Expected results should contribute to help Member States choosing the most appropriate measures and ways for an efficient implementation of BMPs, with the support of scientifically validated technical and economic recommendations, thus contributing to various EU policies such as CAP, Instruction 91/676/CEE, Instruction 80/778/CEE, and more generally the European water policy. Scientific objectives and approach A comparison between different existing or simulated BMPs will be carried out through a cost/effectiveness assessment along with the study of their acceptability by farmers. Effectiveness will be assessed as the evolution of water quality resulting from BMPs' implementation in experimental watersheds. Particular efforts will be carried out to improve BMPs representation in hydrological models, as they can take various forms (landscape structures, agronomic recommendations). Spatial modelling, at various scales, will be used to define critical areas where efforts should be concentrated. As for costs, efforts will concern the evaluation of both direct and indirect costs induced by BMPs implementation. When studying diffuse pollution, individual contributions and de-pollution costs are not known and have to be assessed. Direct costs will therefore be estimated through the definition of contract menus in a Principal/Agent modelling framework. Indirect costs will be estimated as the impact of BMPs on all other branches of the economy with the use of a general equilibrium model. A cost/effectiveness ratio will be calculated for each studied BMP, allowing a comparison of possible alternatives. Unfortunately farmers do not apply BMPs as would be desirable. Possible explanations are that of their low environmental commitment and insufficient implementation practices. Extensive interviews will be carried out to account for the social dimension of farmers' decision-making process. In addition, complementary interviews with land managers will help finding out what are the implementation practices used and problems encountered. This will aim at defining new negotiative implementation methods which will be evaluated in a demonstration project involving both local land managers and farmers. Expected impacts Short term results will consist in a potential cost/effectiveness ratio. Based on the experience of case studies, the project will provide a methodological guideline designed to assess BMPs on the three dimensions of effectiveness, cost and acceptability. Thanks to this integrated assessment of existing and potential BMPs, the expected selection grid should contribute to building a decision support tool both for the EU to implement the eco-conditionality regulation, and, at a local scale, for land managers and local planners to face water resource management related issues.",1,1

The potential effects of pharmaceutically active compounds on humans and aquatic ecosystems are not completely understood, especially if it is considered that PhACs co-exist in mixtures with other compounds (chemical “cocktails”).The uncontrolled release of antibiotics to the environment promotes the selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), which shade further long-term health risks to humans and animals To address this challenge, the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of residual organic matter and microorganisms has become an emerging area of research. In order to overcome the limitation of individuals AOPs the simultaneous application of light based AOPs looks quite interesting. However, in spite of the progress made in fundamental research at bench scale, the practical achievements in the field of environmental photocatalysis have been modest. The PreSTO project deals with the development and demonstration of pilot plants hybrid photocatalytic processes for the simultaneous removal of pathogens & pharmaceuticals from real wastewater effluents.

These polymer coatings have to be applied at the glass. However, there is currently no measurement technique available to determine, if the hydrophobic coating is still on the façade or if the coating has to be reapplied. New polymer deposition means demounting the glass plates! The current status of the industrial use is, that glass companies apply these coatings like an alchemy recipe. There exists no information or data about durability and effectiveness. This goal of this project is to develop a mobile sensor, which allows nondestructively testing whether or not (and also quantitatively how much of) the hydrophobic coating is still on glass facades. This sensor will allow measuring the coating quality of glass plates to be mounted and thereby avoid unnecessary mounting and de-mounting work. The SME proposers will exploit this new technology by using the sensor themselves, and opening a new market in consulting glass façade owners in the right surface treatment and cleaning intervals and by selling measurements.",0,0

The Glover lab recently discovered that flowers also produce structural colours, visible to pollinators, due to ordered striations (like those on a CD) of the cuticle on the petal epidermis. How and when these features develop is unknown. To unveil the genetic mechanisms behind iridescence, I will carry out high-throughput molecular studies along with microscopic observations and biochemical analysis using Venice Mallow (Hibiscus trionum) as a model species to establish the identities and the functions of genes governing the assembly of epidermal ridges. To conduct this work, I will also benefit from ongoing collaboration with physicists to establish the optical properties of these nanostructures, from behavioural ecology tools present in the lab to test pollinators’ reactions to iridescent petals and from the new methodologies I developed during my PhD. This project will discover original developmental pathways, used by flowering plants to shape their surfaces and communicate with insects.",0,0

The project involves novel approaches to reconstruct historical nutrient concentrations using the recently developed technique of diatom-based transfer functions and will use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct different aspects of ecosystem response (phytoplankton, macrophytes, zoobenthos) to changes in nutrient loading. Results from this analysis will be used to develop a tool that will enable coastal managers to assess the magnitude of nutrient reduction necessary to reach a state by which 'only a slight departure of the biological community from the conditions of minimal anthropogenic impact' as defined by the Water Framework Directive.",0,0
926,5643,No,North-West European shelf programme,"The North-West European shelf is one of the world's largest  and its waters belong to the best studied areas of this kind. The area represents an important transit region for dissolved and particulate matter stemming from major European rivers.  Extended research cruises, combined with a number of numerical models, have produced a high level of knowledge. The combined data sets of this area provide one of the most detailed sets of observations ever undertaken in any shelf sea. However due to the large scale and the strong variability of the phenomena involved, present knowledge still has a fragmentary character. No insight exists into the long term evolution of the shelf  system and no reliable estimates are available regarding the net retention or release of matter.   To tackle these questions at an appropriate scale and to  exploit and co- ordinate European preeminence in shelf sea  research there is a strong need from the various research  groups to start an integrated project in this area. This is  the challenge of the NOWESP project.   The objectives can be summarized in the following three  points:   - to quantify the biogeochemical fluxes, such as the fluxes of nutrients, plankton, carbon, and the transport of   organic and inorganic particulate matter, including their   biological and chemical modifications.   - to estimate their variabilities and trends.   - to understand the nature of shelves as a link between   land and ocean.   NOWESP will integrate and analyze existing European data sets. From these integrated data sets the project aims to make an  assessment of the fluxes of energy and matter, as well as  their variability. Because the North-West European Shelf, and especially the North Sea, is an intensively investigated area and possesses a large number of monitoring networks,  comprehensive hydrographic and chemical-biological data sets are available in the NOWESP countries.  These will be made available for the purposes of NOWESP.  NOWESP contributes to fulfil the need for data integration at the Community level and the particular needs of several member states to obtain more knowledge about the fluxes of the  various constituents over the shelf and especially in the  North Sea.  NOWESP provides a state-of-the-art of present-day knowledge on shelf fluxes in the North-West European Shelf and clarifies  the priorities of further field measurements and model  developments from the viewpoint of fluxes.",0,0
802,26857,No,"Environmental assessment of mangrove reforestation as a means of improving coastal protection, stability and fisheries production","The project will study mangrove ecosystems at selected sites in Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. Collaborative research and training on key environmental aspects of mangrove management will be conducted over three years and will involve the Institute of Aquaculture, Stirling (Scotland), University of Coibra (Portugal), Delft Hydraulics (The Netherlands), National Research Council of Thailand, National Pedagogic University, Hanoi (Vietnam) and University of Malaya (Malaysia). The main objective is to assess mangrove replanting methods and the ability of established mangrove plantations to improve coastal protection, sediment stability and coastal zone productivity. The project will examine particularly the relationship between the condition of different mangrove habitats (natural forest, degraded forest, converted areas and replanted areas and aquatic productivity, including fishery and aquaculture yields.   The specific objectives of the work are to assess how effectively mangrove plantations could contribute to (a) coastal protection from storms and erosion processes; (b) trap nutrient-rish sediments; (c) support populations of economically important intertdal shellfish. (d) increase the amounts of organic matter (mangrove leaf detritus) and nutrients into coastal waters; (e) enhance coastal fish stocks by increasing productivity and providing nursery areas; and (f) meet particular needs for physical protection of sea-dykes and aquaculture ponds, or improve the quality of water supplies used for aquaculture.",1,0
574,51603,No,An european flood forecasting system,"Problems to be solved National water authorities are normally able to provide flood warnings between one and four days in advance of flood events. These warnings are usually based on weather forecasts in combination with knowledge of the actual hydrologic conditions in the river basins concerned. However, the emergency civil and water management agencies would benefit from an increase in lead-time, to effectively implement their plans in downstream areas. Therefore there exists a need for improved flood forecasting to extend the flood-warning period. Improved flood forecasting should enable more effective evacuation of people from high-risk areas or the controlled release of water from reservoirs in upstream areas to create temporary retention basins to reduce flood volumes and peaks. EFFS aims at developing a prototype of a 4-10 day in advance European floods forecasting system. This system aims at providing daily information on potential floods for the large rivers Rhine and Oder as well as flash floods in small basins. The framework of the system will allow incorporation of both detailed models for specific basins as well as a broad scale for entire Europe. Scientific objectives and approach The overall objectives of EFFS are to employ currently available Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (4 - 10 days) to produce reliable flood warnings, beyond the current flood warning period of approximately 3 days. The project will design a Medium-Range Flood Forecasting System for Europe that will produce flood warnings on the basis of the Medium Range Weather Forecasts. On the basis of the newly developed system, flood forecasts will be produced in regions where at present flood forecasts are unavailable. The scientific objectives include: 1) the development and application of downscaling techniques for weather forecasts that can be used in real-time operational flood warning systems over large areas, 2) the design of a framework that allows for the use of different rainfall-runoff flood models linked to the Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in order to provide Medium Range Flood Forecasts 3) the investigation of the concept of an overall water balance hydrological model as a basis for regional rainfall-runoff flood modelling. 4) the investigate of the accuracy of the flood forecasts in space and time starting off from uncertainties in Medium Range Weather Forecasts and assess the error propagation through the system 5) the finding of methods to incorporate uncertainties both from the weather forecasts as well as from the hydrologic models to be used in operational forecasts and use them as a decision factor as part of the actual flood forecast 6) the investigation and recommendations concerning methods to disseminate the forecasts to whom they might concern, and to retrieve feedback from the users. Expected impacts Recent developments in the art of weather forecasting have brought the needs for improved flood forecasting within reach. Currently, Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are available for periods between 4 and 10 days ahead. These forecasts, which are still hardly used for practical purposes, could prove particularly useful in providing additional valuable information to decision makers in flood-risk areas. In the present project, the reasonable extension of the forecasting period will be examined by an assessment of the accuracy as a function of lead-time, location and season, and the minimum requirements put forward by the end-users. Weather forecasts: Data of all three events have been collected and disseminated to the project partners. Databases: Both the hydrological and geographical databases are ready to test the forecasting system for the selected events. A real-time hydrological data supply is organised for this project. Hydrological modelling: The LISFLOOD model is ready for flood forecasting application. A description of forecasting hydrological models has been made. Parameter estimation: Instrument development: The Flood Forecasting System has been developed and implemented for the Rhine basin. The functional and technical design of the Flood Forecasting System is described. Dissemination of flood forecasting results: An overview of current methods in Europe is ready.",1,0
17,227928,Yes,Bioelectrochemical anaerobic oxidation of ammonia for sustainable N removal from wastewater,"In the last decade, the field of microbial electro catalysis has given birth to a wide variety of microbial electrochemical technologies (MET). MET use the extraordinary ability of some microorganisms to transfer electrons from a substrate in wastewater to a solid-state anode, which allows for different applications e.g., production of H2 , CH4, or electricity, desalination or simply wastewater treatment. Recently, electroactive microorganisms were integrated in constructed wetlands (CW) for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater in a new technology called METland®. METlands allow for intensification of (previously considered extensive) CW for decentralized wastewater treatment. Although METlands perform 10-times better than conventional CW in terms of removal of organic C, about 50% of the NH4\ in the wastewater remains untouched and is discharged to surface waters contributing to N pollution and high risk of eutrophication. The majority of studies about MET focus on heterotrophic microorganisms but few works have studied anaerobic NH4\ oxidizing-, anode respiring microorganisms. The feammox reaction (anaerobic oxidation of ammonium using insoluble Fe3\ as electron acceptor) has been shown in natural environments but has yet not been exploited for wastewater treatment. Integration of feammox in wastewater treatment by replacing the iron by an anode will enable anaerobic nitrification, minimizing the most problematic issue for treating wastewater in thousands of European small populations: the costs derived from energy-intensive aeration for conventional nitrification. In ELECTRAMMOX we will enrich and characterize anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing, anode-respiring microorganisms (electrammox bacteria) and integrate them in METlands for N removal from sewage. The project outlines a research trajectory that includes fundamental investigation of the metabolism of electrammox bacteria and their application for wastewater treatment at a pilot scale.",1,1

The NEGOWAT project will elaborate, structure and test a methodology combining an agent-based modelling approach and role game playing as a mediating tool for facilitating negotiations over land and water management, in the context of metropolitan upstream catchments in Latin America. The research aims to provide (i) a conceptual tool that will allow to analyse land and water management in this context (ii) a methodology and computing tools (including guidelines for its implementation) to explore, test and discuss scenarios, reinforcing the participation of marginalized stakeholders of the city fringe in all stages of the negotiation process.",1,1
894,107131,No,The historical evidence for European environmental and meteorological extremes AD 400 – 1000,"Understanding our environmental history is one of the most urgent research tasks facing humanity. Despite the necessity of improving our understanding of global environmental trends, our knowledge of environmental conditions in the period AD 400 – 1000 is very limited compared to that for the years post AD 1200. Yet very recent advances in regard to obtaining scientific natural proxy data and the ability to locate and analyse a significant corpus of historical European documents offer the prospect of an invaluable insight into the climate of the early medieval era. At the heart of the current proposal is the conviction that a medieval historian with expertise in working with Europe’s annals and chronicles, working among colleagues with a strong engagement with medieval social history, can compile accurate environmental data from the documentary sources for the period AD 400 - 1000. Prior to the eleventh-century the volume of available contemporary sources in Europe is known to decrease significantly and this has deterred historical climatologists from tackling such an early period. But this does not mean that relevant information is not available. Using modern historical source criticism to indicate the prospective reliability of the information obtained from the documents, the results obtained by the two years of research will be put into a database in a form that will allow statistically valid comparison with scientific environmental natural ‘proxy’ data.The goal of this research proposal, however, is not just to compile an innovative database of early medieval environmental information, but to use the comparison with the scientific proxy data to provide answers to very fundamental and ‘high level’ questions such as whether there was a Medieval Warm Period? Or: what were the societal consequences of abrupt climatic changes and extreme weather events? And perhaps most important of all: how anomalous is the recent large-scale phase of climate warming.",0,0
420,60121,No,Railway interoperable manufacture and modular safety (TRAINSAFE),The European railway system is undergoing two major changes: - Separation of the infrastructure management activity from that of train operation. - The opening up of the rail network to new entrants. There is a real danger of critical knowledge being dispersed and lost through rail industry fragmentation. This will put increased pressure on a network already faced with new challenges in the fields of international services and tram/train intermodality. Meeting the challenge demands a new global or holistic approach to the safety of the entire rail system to ensure that any actor in the European railway system is able to maintain the same high level of safety achieved prior to the changes in their relationships.,0,0
781,43250,No,Development of a new rapid prototyping technology for the direct pr oduction of solid metal components from 3d cad data,"European engineering and manufacturing companies currently spend an estimated 160 m ECU on models, produced by the five or six types of Rapid Prototyping (RP) processes commonly available. In the vast majority of cases, these processes cannot build parts from many common engineering materials and, therefore, the application of these parts is limited to use as nonrepresentative models. One of the principal focuses of current worldwide RTD in the RP field is toward expanding the range of build materials for use with existing processes to include industrially relevant polymers, which will undoubtedly expand the market for polymeric RP models. However, of the 250,000 engineering and manufacturing companies in the EU, it is estimated that 70% are SME's providing metal components to various industrial sector. Hence the potential market for a representative metal prototype is estimated at 500 m ECU. No current RP system can produce representative metal components. Whilst a number of traditional manufacturing routes (primarily investment and sand casting) have been adapted to use polymeric RP models as patterns for metallic component manufacture, these impose limitations in terms of geometric complexity, component accuracy, material properties and lead time. As such they do not represent the most effective route to accelerated metal prototype fabrication. The primary industrial need for this RTD involves the European engineering and manufacturing sector requirement for novel methods of accurate, representative metal prototype fabrication. This facility will improve global competitiveness through the reduction of product development costs and time scales. Hence the primary industrial objective of the proposed RTD is to develop the enabling technology allowing the production of representative metal parts with an accuracy and build time, at worst comparable to existing polymeric RP techniques. The development of such an RP system is expected to provide cost and time savings of at least 30% over conventional manufacturing techniques. In addition, there is a secondary industrial need, in the European tool manufacturing sector, for new and innovative methods of production Injection Mouid Tooling manufacture in order to compete against cost and delivery time advantages currently offered by Pacific Rim and Eastern Bloc competitors. These advantages are recognised by the European moulding industry to be in excess of 25 % and 20 % respectively. The secondary industrial objective of the proposed RTD is to generate reductions of over 40 %, in both cost and delivery time, compared to current Mould Tool manufacturing techniques for components described in the first and second categories. This complements existing and proposed EU RTD relating to the other two categories. Achieving this goal will provide a visible competitive advantage for European SME tooling manufacturers and will largely eliminate Far Eastern and Eastern Bloc competition from the European market place. As European industry cannot hope to compete with labour costs associated with Pacific Rim manufacturing operations, competitive advantage can only be regained by the introduction of new manufacturing techniques which are radically different to tool manufacturing techniques currently standard within the industry.",0,0
225,203389,Yes,Self-Sustaining Cleaning Technology for Safe Water Supply and Management in Rural African Areas,"This project focuses on a major challenge in African countries: In the 15 sub-Saharan African countries 108 million people have limited or even no access to clean water. The SafeWaterAfrica project will research and develop an autonomous and decentralized water treatment system for rural and peri-urban areas which is highly efficient in the degradation of harmful pollutants and at the same time very effective in killing microbiological contaminants. The system will be designed to provide 300 people in rural areas. With a market penetration of 3000 systems the project has the potential to supply 900,000 people within app. four years after the end of the project. The project includes capacity building and business development so that system ownership and responsibility are in the hands of the local rural communities. The joint European-African development will result in a low-cost solution easy to handle and operate. It will take into account the specific cultural aspects of the region and will be designed for operation with local staff and in the responsibility of local communities or local water service providers, respectively. These “Made in Africa” systems will therefore have a high level of acceptance in the rural areas which promotes the implementation of the technology. Ten transdisciplinary partners from Europe and Africa, assisted by eight enterprises and organisations in the Advisory Board, will work jointly over a project duration of 42 months to adapt a specific European water treatment technology into an African water treatment system solution. Besides, SafeWaterAfrica will generate the technological basis for innovative business models related to the development of water treatment products, which are produced, installed, operated and maintained in Africa. The resulting creation of new jobs will contribute to the social well-being and will promote economic growth in the rural and peri-urban areas of the southern African countries.",1,1
152,224676,Yes,STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR WATER RESOURCES AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NOVEL BIOTECHNICAL TREATMENT SOLUTIONS AND GOOD PRACTICES,"The overall aim of the SPRING project is to present an integrated water resource management for reliable water supply for all needs that involve; developing innovative simple to operate bio oxidation systems for treatment of polluted water bodies (stagnant and flowing), cost effective real time monitoring tools and finally by implementing good practices in water planning for treatment, supply and usage. SPRING aims at improving and developing technologies for the elimination of pollutants from water using a bioremediation approach.   In particular, SPRING aims at improving and developing bioremediation technologies for the removal of organic micro-pollutants present in groundwater and surface water at low concentrations, and which are currently treated using expensive physicochemical technology. Innovation also revolves around provision of simplified water quality monitoring methods and developing novel  microbial technology to monitor pollutants in water. The Project will also develop real time detection systems to highlight different pollutants risks and flooding/water insufficiency scenarios. Field trials of the developed prototype in urban and rural settings will be carried out with the help of Municipality and an NGO.  In addition, an inclusive decision-making process will contribute to democracy and will lend the decision legitimacy. Acceptance of remediation schemes during implementation will be enhanced by involving stakeholders and the public in the decision-making stage and thus, stakeholders decision making and management framework in the form of an NGO and a local Governing Body (Municipality) will be formed.  Successful implementation and demonstration of the developed systems involving all stakeholders will help to achieve wide public acceptance towards reuse and recycling of wastewater through the developed bioremediation technology",1,1
1027,73035,No,A Robotic-Arm Orthosis Controlled by Electroencephalography and Gaze for Locked-In Paralytics,"The project is an interdisciplinary effort, blending human motor physiology with engineering in order to create an intuitively controlled robotic orthosis which, for the first time, restores arm movement and basic functionality needed by severely paralysed (locked-in) patients. There have been internationally spread efforts to do so based on prosthetic technology and electrophysiology, but so far none have made a clinical impact. The unique combination of technologies we propose aims to overcome practical challenges, which have so far merely promised breakthroughs. The pneumatic robot will be inexpensive and light, fitting snugly around a patient's arm. The issue of transmitting commands from the user's brain to the paralysed limb or orthotically assisted arm has been the subject of the young field of electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (EEG BCI).  Shortcomings of current efforts, corruption of electrode signals by head/eye motion, and limited data transmission rate are overcome by using gaze tracking to encode target position information for reaching. The BCI would be based on an advanced, reliable design developed at the host institution, which discriminates EEG readiness potentials for different motor action intentions. Mapping motor action to new motor action, whose performance and stability is ensured by the robot, helps preserve intuitiveness of use. The project presents a new line of research in robotics and BCI, is geared to solving an urgent clinical need, but also opens up new possibilities of research into basic questions about motor physiology and brain function and organisation. Finally, the proposer is given an opportunity to use the full spectrum of his interdisciplinary expertise, and create a small research group that can potentially train a new generation of young scientists in a fast-evolving area of research.",0,0
107,52177,Yes,Pesticides in european groundwaters : detailed study of representative aquifers and simulation of possible evolution scenarios,"Problems to be solved Pesticide concentrations above the 0.1 µg/L drinking water limit have been reported in many groundwater (GW) used for drinking water supplies in Europe. Questions as why it happens and how it will evolve in the near and distant future cannot be answered at the moment. Because the GW is used extensively for drinking water purposes, this is a problem of true European dimension. PEGASE will focus on delivering performance-assessed tools to predict the possible evolution of GW contamination by pesticides at the aquifer scale and to assess the socio-economic implications of alternative scenarios aiming at GW quality restoration or protection. An improved knowledge of the relative importance of processes involved in pesticide transport to and in the GW of representative aquifers will benefit the harmonized regulatory procedure and eventually lead to reductions in environmental deterioration, benefiting the community at local, regional, national and international levels. The work to be conducted through PEGASE will complement European policy objectives by providing tools that will help in implementing the Member States policies across Europe by both legislators and stakeholders. Scientific objectives and approach The global objective of PEGASE is to enable predictive modelling of pesticide contamination of representative European aquifers, and assessment of socio-economic implications of the present and future contamination. Specific objectives and innovations are the: · Production of high quality data sets with intensive (36 monthly samplings) and extensive (land use, pesticide applications, soil, vadose zone and aquifer characteristics) monitoring of aquifers ranging from a 1 hectare area of a sandy aquifer with GW table < 2 m bgl to a karst aquifer with GW > 10 m bgl. · Development of mechanistic and semi-empirical tools dedicated to the specialized modelling of pesticide contamination of GW, with i) operating links between root zone models and aquifer models, ii) consideration of non-equilibrium phenomena, and iii) incorporation of uncertainties associated with the field data and the results from transport models. · Performance assessment of those tools using the data of the first 24 months monitoring for calibration, and assessing the predictive capacity (extrapolation step) by comparing predicted GW levels and pesticide concentrations with the values of the third hydrological cycle monitored. · Socio-economic assessment of alternative scenarios including changes in land use and agricultural practices aiming at GW quality restoration or protection in a context of sustainable development. Expected impacts A better understanding of how pesticide concentrations in GW are most likely to evolve over time (a key objective of PEGASE project) will enable a more cost-effective configuration of the treatment plants and result in a cheaper water supply for consumers, thereby yielding considerable benefits to end-users of GW resources. The knowledge provided by PEGASE will also help avoid very restrictive land practices to be recommended or imposed that would not take account of site-specific conditions (e.g. a particularly slow GW recharge, or long transit time of the water flux trough a very thick unsaturated zone). Finally, by identifying areas least at risk for GW pesticide contamination, PEGASE will enable the available financial resources to be allocated to the most vulnerable areas, thus maximizing the improvement the society may expect from its limited financial and natural resources. All stakeholders will be associated with the socio-economic work in PEGASE, ensuring the choice of scenarios that may possibly be implemented and a true assessment of their direct and indirect environmental implications.",1,1

The EC White paper on Sustainable Transport calls for rail operators to: -Double passenger traffic and triple freight traffic by 2020 -Reduce LCC by 30% The Railway Business Scenario 2020 also calls for railways to capture 15% of freight and 12% of the passenger market. To achieve these objectives, investment alone is not sufficient, significant innovation and technology transfer is essential. This can only be achieved with very close cooperation between IMs and industry suppliers. It is essential that the IMs, as the end users, set out their priorities and needs, at a European Level, to solve the necessary problems for achieving the white paper objectives.   This will be done by performing research on four key topics:  -Track support structure  -Switches and Crossings  -Rails  -Logistics for track maintenance and renewal To ensure that cost reductions can be consistently evaluated across Europe, InnoTrack will also devise an innovative generic methodology for LCC calculation, based on best LCC practices at EU level, to be used by all IMs across Europe.   For each of the research topics, InnoTrack will:  - Analyse the root causes of identified issues on a European scale taking into account the effect of different duty conditions whilst providing product and service solutions for cheaper and longer lasting tracks  - Draw together common European specifications regarding Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) combined with LCC  - Provide innovative solutions to reduce failure rates and decrease LCC of material, equipment, machinery and systems Finally, InnoTrack will assure a wide dissemination through UIC and UNIFE, 2 organisations representing IMs and industry.",0,0

970,218223,No,Exploring the nucleation of large earthquakes: cascading and unpredictable or slowly driven and forecastable,"How do earthquakes begin? Answering this question is essential to understand fault mechanics but also to determine our ability to forecast large earthquakes. Although it is well established that some events are preceded by foreshocks, contrasting views have been proposed on the nucleation of earthquakes. Do these foreshocks belong to a cascade of random failures leading to the mainshock? Are they triggered by an aseismic nucleation phase in which the fault slips slowly before accelerating to a dynamic, catastrophic rupture? Will we ever be able to monitor and predict the slow onset of earthquakes or are we doomed to observe random, unpredictable cascades of events? We are currently missing a robust tool for quantitative estimation of the proportion of seismic versus aseismic slip during the rupture initiation, cluttering our attempts at understanding what physical mechanisms control the relationship between foreshocks and the onset of large earthquakes.  The current explosion of available near-fault ground-motion observations is an unprecedented opportunity to capture the genesis of earthquakes along active faults. I will develop an entirely new method based a novel data assimilation procedure that will produce probabilistic time-dependent slip models assimilating geodetic, seismic and tsunami datasets. While slow and rapid fault processes are usually studied independently, this unified approach will address the relative contribution of seismic and aseismic deformation.  The first step is the development of a novel probabilistic data assimilation method providing reliable uncertainty estimates and combining multiple data types. The second step is a validation of the method and an application to investigate the onset of recent megathrust earthquakes in Chile and Japan. The third step is the extensive, global use of the algorithm to the continuous monitoring of time-dependent slip along active faults providing an automated detector of the nucleation of earthquakes.",0,0
913,88019,No,Chiral Organometallics for Asymmetric Synthesis,"Chemical processes (synthesis) that create new C-C bonds from simpler molecules are also hugely important as this is how chemical complexity is built up. In a synthesis starting molecules are used to build new molecules by means of various chemical reactions. Organic synthesis generally involves the reaction between two molecules a nucleophile and an electrophile. These are attracted to each other rather like opposite poles of a magnet and a chemical bond is created between them. One class of useful nucleophiles are organometallic reagents as they readily react with electrophiles to make new bonds. However, chiral organometallic reagents are very rare, but clearly if they could be easily prepared they would be extremely useful as they would provide a direct synthesis of a broad range of chiral molecules. We propose a unique method for generating configurationally stable chiral organometallics and then we will explore what classes of electrophiles they react with. Our method involves initially generating a nucleophile (bearing a group that also leaves during the course of the reaction) (an organometallic reagent) and reacting it with another nucleophile (an organometallic reagent) to create a new chiral organometallic. We believe that reactions of this class of nucleophiles with conventional and non- conventional electrophiles will open up a whole new area of synthesis and provide a step change in asymmetric synthesis that could have far reaching consequences. With this information we will then apply the new chemistry in the synthesis of biologically important molecules that are otherwise difficult to make.

481,217982,No,AuTonomous intraLuminAl Surgery,"In modern surgery body lumens increasingly serve as access route to deeply located anatomic regions. Navigation through narrow and mostly fragile and deformable lumens requires considerable skill, dexterity and consequently imposes a large mental load. Visualization is notoriously poor. Due to phenomena such as slack, backlash and compliance the controllability of the instruments is bad. Surgeons undergo steep learning curves and even experienced surgeons often lack confidence about their gestures. Surgical risks including internal bleeding, tissue damage, puncture or rupture are imminent.   ATLAS will produce a generation of European researchers that will develop robotic skills and techniques to automate complex surgical intraluminal therapies. Due to physiological phenomena or the surgical action the anatomy changes considerably, reducing the value of pre-operative data and imaging. Compliant instruments must be employed to navigate through lumens. As they proceed they deform and undergo complex and distributed contacts with the fragile environment. Step changes in intra-operative and distributed sensing, real-time modeling and 3D reconstruction, decision-making, intra-operative planning and autonomous control will be made to deal with the extreme variability that is encountered.   Whereas assistive technology for steering flexible endoscopes, ureteroscopes, colonoscopes, guidewires and vascular catheters has been notoriously disparate and incoherent, ATLAS will develop and train researchers in identifying and exploiting the commonalities amongst these cases. This generalization will lead to a rigorous unified framework and guidelines to deploy assistive techniques tailored to each specific therapy. The ATLAS consortium consists of Europe’s leading institutes in the field of surgery automation and design and control of flexible instruments. It is backed up by a broad set of clinical and industrial partners that are eager to get involved in subsequent exploitation.",0,0
160,29182,Yes,Prenormative research for metallic andcementitious materials in contact with drinking water,"Potable water must not contain contaminants that could lead to acute or chronic adverse health effects or exhibit undesirable aesthetic aspects such as objectionable odour or taste. Such contaminants can arise from the materials used to distribute and store drinking water. The Construction Product Directive demands that such products satisfy 'Essential Requirements' including requirements for safety and health. The quality of drinking water in EU countries is covered by the Directive 80/778/EEC but this does not cover many of the contaminants that can be associated with the above mentioned products. Most EU countries therefore operate regulatory schemes for the approval of such products and materials. Attempts to harmonize the different schemes have so far met difficulties in that existing systems are heaviliy biased to 'organic' products. The approval of metallic and cement-based products is much more difficult because leaching from these products, unlike organic products, can be markedly influenced by the chemical nature of drinking water.  The aim of this pre-normative research project is to carry out investigations in the area of effects on water quality of materials in contact with drinking water that will lead to the development of screening tests for those inorganic materials for which there are no data available. In addition, a rig test to determine the influence of different water types will be developed. The investigations on the different parameters related to the test procedures for metallic and cementitious materials are in good progress (mid-term situation). For cements, many data are now available and few complementary experiments are required for the design of a standardized test procedure. For metallic materials, much work still needs to be performed before an accurate test procedure can be designed. The programme is separated in various work packages. A critical assessment of the tests currently available for metallic products and comparison of their performance and usefulness will involve the evaluation of (1) the impact of dissolved metallic elements on the organoleptic water characteristics, (2) the migration of metallic elements from coupons according to water characteristics and contact time (comparison of existing procedures), and (3) the design of test conditions to be applied to a wide range of alloys and water types. Investigations on preconditioning procedures for cementitious materials will also be carried out by testing materials as pipe sections filled with test water.",0,1
675,188244,No,Developmental Learning of Internal Models for Robotic Manipulation based on Motor Primitives and  Multisensory Integration,"'Dexterous manipulation is a key challenge for the dissemination of robots in our society: most of the tasks robots can be useful for resort in some form of manipulation of objects. However, unlike humans, robots only achieve good performances in very controlled settings, failing to scale to unknown environments or novel objects. This project focuses on three main aspects of human motor control that can be combined to improve the performances of current robots: internal models, development and multisensory integration. We propose the concept of 'hierarchical, probabilistic and contextual' internal models, that should allow to cope with the main issues related to motor control in real world. A hierarchical organization of models dealing with different levels of complexity will allow the system to represent from simple grasping to finer manipulation, and to be able to respond properly to the environment depending on the available sensory information. These different levels of complexity will be acquired incrementally through motor experience in a developmental way. Different sensory modalities will be combined in a probabilistic (Bayesian) fashion, depending on their reliability and the associated computational cost. We aim at both i) proposing a general framework for learning and control in complex systems, and ii) devising a working solution for robotic manipulation. Moreover, due the bio-inspired nature of the project, a secondary goal is also to support hypotheses proposed by psychologists and neuroscientists about human development and learning. The work will be implemented on the humanoid robot iCub, one of the most advanced robotic platforms for research on cognition, and will combine several results of past and ongoing European projects in the fields of dexterous manipulation (HANDLE), cognitive modeling (RobotCub and RoboSoM) and motor learning theories (Poeticon\\), in which the host laboratory has been or is currently involved.'",0,0
353,98912,No,EM safety  and Hazards Mitigation by proper EV design,"The project aims at increasing the public confidence in the safety regarding electromagnetic fields (EMF) in the fully electric vehicles (FEV). Public expectations to move towards the electrification of road transport are driven by a multitude of factors and concerns including: climate change, primary energy dependence and public health as well as cost and scarcity of raw materials. Road transport remains the main source of many local noxious emissions including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Within urban areas, the noxious emissions due to road transport are particularly high. There is a growing body of evidence linking vehicle pollutants to severe health effects such as respiratory and cardio-pulmonary diseases and lung cancer. In general according to the World Health Organization the emissions from car exhausts are responsible for more deaths than road accidents. On the other hand, there is widespread public concern regarding the possible adverse effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). Thus, there is a need to avoid the spread of panic or unjustified fears that would delay the enormous and crucial economic and environmental benefits that the FEV can provide when deployed on a large scale.",0,0

This is also the international catchment where the recent catastrophic cyanide and heavy metal pollution accidents happened. These are the major reasons why this single catchment was selected for this proposal. The work will be focussed at the development of a 'real-life-scale' catchments model for this river basin. Another major work item will be the development of ecohydrological management strategies for the unique wetlands of the ripanan zone of the river.

153,95245,Yes,Integrative water sampling for the detection and identification of antiandrogenic contaminants in European rivers,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are environmental contaminants which have the potential to disrupt the normal functioning of the neuroendocrine system in animals and so result in physiological dysfunction. The effects of EDCs on wildlife and their potential effects on human health are a major concern to the scientific community and public. In Europe, EDCs with estrogenic activity are prevalent in effluents from wastewater treatment works (WwTWs), and may result in feminization of male fish in downstream waters reducing their fertility. Most recently, studies have shown that WwTWs effluents contain high concentrations of antiandrogenic activity, but unlike estrogenic chemicals, the identity of the antiandrogenic contaminants is currently unknown. This project aims to identify the antiandrogenic contaminants in WwTWs effluents using passive sampling techniques to obtain an integrative extract of contaminated waters over time. Antiandrogens in effluent extracts will be identified by bioassay-directed fractionation using a combination of in vitro androgen receptor assays and mass spectrometry analyses. Once identified, the range of concentrations of key antiandrogenic chemicals in river waters will be determined using integrative passive sampling of sites upstream and downstream of effluent discharges. This project will provide a more informed knowledge of the range of EDCs in river waters. The work will contribute to environmental impact assessments of these new and emerging environmental chemicals and have importance in the regulation of discharges, and thus is of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public in Europe. The project will bring Dr Liscio to work with Dr Hill, and allow her to benefit from a number of scientific and complementary training activities which will prepare the fellow for an independent research career in environmental science.",0,1

With more than 200 clients and more than 500 apparatus installed the company is a recognised leader in the Nordic market. InSightPro will deliver a novel Fourier Transform Near-Infrared on-line solution with a set of cloud functionalities aimed to enter new international markets and consolidate their position. Through the interactions with our clients and our small-scale pilot studies, we have found a niche of market (i.e. €250m) composed of large companies together with numerous medium size dairy producers and processors which can afford the investment but do not have the trained staff to deal with the calibration, maintenance and measurement issues. The global Dairy Industry (worth €64.bn) has been going through tough times due to the world recession, reduction in milk sales, price, and production fluctuations. The Industry needs to be more resilient to changes over time through implementing a complete modernisation of the production towards Industry 4.0. Dairy companies (i.e. farms and processing plants) must continuously increase their competitiveness by saving costs and adding value to their products to satisfy a demanding consumer. Our solution allows companies across the dairy industry to perform an easy and unattended production optimisation and monitoring with fast (i.e. <1 year post-installation) return of investment (RoI).  InSightPro will serve to bring our product to new markets both EU and US while enabling us to understand how our product needs to be improved and adapted to every process line. It will move our product to full commercial readiness for a Europe-wide launch and a market penetration in the US. The project will enable our company continuous success with turnover expectations of €35.4m, an accumulated net profit of over €26.7m and reaching a RoI of 13.59 after 5 years post project completion.",0,0

In order to study carefully the chosen theme, we will rely on the concept of coopetition. The chosen period should allow for a comparison of legislation enforcement since the reign of the Archdukes, starting with the death of King Philip II, after which the Netherlands was ceded to the archducal couple, until the death of King Philip IV.

305,94570,Yes,Stability of sorbed arsenic by pipe scales and biofilms in drinking water distribution systems,"The notion that inorganic contaminants behave conservatively between the point of entry (after conventional or reverse osmosis-desalination water treatment) and the point of use by consumers is currently being re-visited by EU regulatory agencies. One of the main reasons deteriorating the quality of home tap water is related to the accumulation of contaminants, such as arsenic (As) to scale and biofilm growth in drinking water pipe walls. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that changes in solution chemistry of the finished water adversely influences the stability of sorbed As by pipe scales. Our long-range goal is to provide mechanistic insight to critical unanswered questions related to the stability of sorbed As by pipe scales and biofilm conglomerates (PSBC) in drinking water distribution systems, thereby eliminating health risk associated with human ingestion of As-contaminated water. If we identify the factors influencing the stability of sorbed As, then we could formulate guidelines to minimize the health risk from the release of sorbed As into the finished water. The stability of the pipe scales (amorphous masses of corrosion by-products mixed with biofilms) may be undermined by the presence of disinfection by-products, ii) to the nonconventional corrosivity of desalinated water or iii) by changes in bulk solution chemical properties and SBC surface chemical parameters. Knowledge obtained from this project will, i) minimize the human health risk associated with the presence of toxic As in the finished water; and ii) formulate specific guidelines for the effective decontamination of SBC in drinking water pipes. This IRG project will prove most useful to the recently reintegrated coordinator towards developing his Water and Health research program in the Eastern Mediterranean region.",1,1
294,17828,Yes,Technical and resource assessment of low-head hydropower in Europe,"The project involves three main areas of research:  1. assessment of the scale and nature of low-head resources in selected regions of Europe  2. to assess existing hydropower technology for exploiting low head sites, and to review new designs and methods for improving cost-effectiveness.  3. to study the economics of low and ultra-low head hydro power in the light of commercial cost data obtained, and to assess the potential for cost-saving through technical innovation.   A comprehensive final report presenting the findings of the research and the conclusions reached.   The project compiled a database covering nearly 100 000 km2 containing 231 low head sites that have potential grid-connected power from 100 kW to 10 MW with little environmental impact. A computer model, HYDROSOFT, was devised to calculate the theoretical and technical potential for each site and to make an assessment of the economic feasibility. Extrapolating the resource potential to 12 other EU countries indicated that low head hydropower has, to date, been largely neglected as a renewable energy source. However, it shows promise as a significant and unexpected energy resource for Europe. The estimated EU resource runs to 3000 MWe utilising only existing river structure to avoid high civil engineering costs. Up to 70% of this resource could be cost-effective today (with a tariff of 0.08 ECU/kWh) using existing technology. The study showed that only 40% of the technical resource potential, 24% of the theoretical resource potential, has been developed so far. This project is a major new assessment of the potential for low and ultra-low head hydro-power in England, the Netherlands and Germany. It is intended to form the basis for new initiatives in the use of run-of-river low-head hydropower in Europe, For this project, Low Head and Ultra-Low Head have been defined as 3m to 5m and 1m to 3m respectively. Low-head hydropower constitutes a major renewable energy resource within Europe, with many thousands of potential sites already defined by flood control structures on medium and large rivers. However it has generally been found that low-head sites are too expensive to develop using current technology.  The main activities of this project are:  1. To compile a database of low-head sites in selected regions of the UK, the Netherlands and Germany for which installations of approximately 200kW or greater would be technically feasible.  2. To review the technology and costs of existing low-head hydro technology, with reference to case studies, and identify areas for cost-saving. Data will be collected from manufacturers and users.   3. To evaluate novel design concepts for improving the cost-effectiveness of low-head hydro-installations.  4. To define the cost and performance targets required for commercial viability of low-head hydro-plant, and hence to estimate the proportion of the low-head resource which could be economic.   5. To specify promising areas for future R&D to improve the cost-effectiveness of hydro installations operating at low heads.",1,1
973,106377,No,Phase I/II Gene Therapy Trial of Fanconi anemia patients with a new Orphan Drug consisting of a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene: A Coordinated International Action,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited syndrome characterized by the early development of bone marrow failure and increasing predisposition to cancer with age. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is the only curative therapy for hematopoietic manifestations of FA, although associated with complications arising from myeloablation, graft versus host disease and increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. The genetic correction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with lentiviral vectors constitutes a recent and safe alternative for the treatment of different genetic diseases affecting mature cells from different tissues and/or committed progenitors of the hematopoietic system. One of the key features of FA that make it a unique disease for gene therapy approaches rely on the characteristic proliferation defect that is already evident in the very primitive HSCs. Thus, a marked survival advantage would be expected from corrected HSCs, potentially allowing normalization of hematopoiesis in the absence or after mild conditioning. Difficulties in the collection of sufficient numbers of HSC from FA patients and the use of sub-optimal transduction protocols with gammaretroviral vectors limited the success of FA gene therapy trials conducted 10 years ago in the USA. Our innovative approach to develop for the first time an efficient and safe gene therapy of FA is based on two recent innovations: 1) Discovery of potent HSC mobilizers, such as plerixafor, and 2) Development of a new lentiviral vector by members of this Consortium, designed as Orphan Drug by the EC in December 2010. The principal objective of this Project is, therefore, the development of a multicentric Phase I/II gene therapy trial for FA-A patients, based on the genetic correction of plerixafor\G-CSF mobilized HSCs with the novel lentiviral vector, accompanied by comprehensive and groundbreaking safety and efficacy patient monitoring studies.",0,0
706,89278,No,Regulation and function of non-coding RNAs in epigenetic processes: the paradigm of X-chromosome inactivation,"Some 150 years after the emergence of genetics, epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly understood to be fundamental players in phenotype transmission and development. In addition, epigenetic alterations are now linked to several human diseases including cancers. A common feature of many epigenetic phenomena, for which X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the paradigm, is the implication of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Regulatory ncRNAs belong to 2 major classes: (i) long ncRNAs, which can be transcribed from a single strand as well as in the opposite orientation when they may overlap with either protein-coding or non-coding genes. Both sense (Xist) and antisense (Tsix) ncRNAs control the initiation of XCI; and (ii) short ncRNAs, such as si- or miRNAs, which interfere, through different pathways, with gene function. The aim of this project is to gain insights into the regulation and function of ncRNAs in the control of gene expression program, using XCI as a model system. We propose to combine molecular genetics, embryology and cell biology to (1) decipher the transcriptional control of Xist and the coordinate regulation of the Xist/Tsix sense/antisense tandem in relation to developmental programs; (2) functionally characterise a novel ncRNA on the X chromosome which nests several miRNAs and for which preliminary data suggest a role in XCI and (3) develop a system to extend our knowledge of the regulatory stages of XCI in human through the use of human embryonic stem cells. Our comprehensive analysis of the function and regulation of ncRNAs in XCI has important implications for our understanding of the numerous diseases associated with abnormal patterns of inactivation and is a critical prerequisite to any subsequent therapeutic approaches. This project is in absolute adequacy with the future “Epigenetic and Cell Fate “ host centre co-headed by Prs. Lalande and Viegas-Pequignot, a large-scale initiative expected to strengthen French and European research in Epigenetics.",0,0
28,211174,Yes,Innovative system for medium scale water desalination 100% powered by renewable energies,"We are RAINMAKER, a Dutch SME specialized in providing sustainable and disruptive solutions to combat water scarcity. We have developed W2W –water to water- the first water desalination system fully off-grid and fully powered by renewable energies (wind & solar). Within Europe, especially western and Southern regions suffer water shortages, which will become increasingly more frequent and severe due to water demands and climate change.  Seawater represents an inexhaustible resource to produce drinking water. However, conventional desalination techniques are extremely energy-intensive that are designed for large-scale capacity plants. Its cost is prohibitive for zones than require a smaller production of water. W2W is an innovative option for obtaining safe drinking water from seawater, brackish water or even polluted groundwater.   The system consists of a wind turbine connected to a heat pump that is powered by solar energy when wind flow decreases, thus 100% powered by renewable energies. The thermal energy created by the power unit is used in a state-of-the-art membrane distillation system to evaporate and then condense feedwater from a water source to create fresh, pure water.  A single unit of W2W can desalinate more than 95,000 litres of water a day, which can provide drinking water for more than 800 people without any grid connection.  Water is produced locally directly where it is needed without the need for long distribution nets and associated energy costs.   Our system is targeted to coastal municipalities in the Mediterranean that need to increase their water purification capacity. Disaster relieve and emergency response operations can also benefit from W2W: it provides drinking water without the need of any energy/fuel supply, exactly the things that are normally lacking in such areas.  Thanks to the development of this innovation we expect to gain a strong position in a highly attractive market currently worth 8.8 billion € and growing at a CARG of 9%.",1,1
154,91254,Yes,Development of rehabilitation technologies and approaches for multipressured degraded waters and the integration of their impact on river basin management,"Within the AQUAREHAB project, different innovative rehabilitation technologies for soil, groundwater and surface water will be developed to cope with a number of hazardous (nitrates, pesticides, chlorinated and aromatic compounds, mixed pollutions,…) within heavily degraded water systems. The technologies are activated riparian zones/wetlands;  smart biomass containing carriers for treatment of water in open trenches; in-situ technologies to restore degraded surface water by inhibiting influx of pollutants from groundwater to surface water;  multifunctional permeable barriers and injectable Fe-based particles for rehabilitation of groundwater. Methods will be developed to determine the (long-term) impact of the innovative rehabilitation technologies on the reduction of the influx of these priority pollutants towards the receptor. A connection between the innovative technologies and river basin management will be worked out.  In a first stage of the project, the technologies and integration of their impact in river basin management will be developed in three different river basins (Denmark, Israel, Belgium). In a second stage, the generic approaches will be extrapolated to one or two more river basins.  One of the major outcomes of the project will be a generic river basin management tool that integrates multiple measures with ecological and economic impact assessments of the whole water system. The research in the project is focussed on innovative rehabilitation strategies to reduce priority pollutants in the water system whereas the generic management tool will include other measures related to flood protection, water scarcity and ecosystem health, The project will aid in underpinning river basin management plans being developed in EU Member States, and will demonstrate cost effective technologies that can provide technical options for national and local water managers, planners and other stakeholders (drinking water companies, industry, agriculture,",1,1

The project will operate on three scales, namely the EC scale, the regional scale (the Rhine basin), and the catchment scale. The links between the various elements are via consistent climate change scenarios and a consistent methodology.  The basic methodology to be used in the current project will consist in the application of a hydrological and water resources model under current and perturbed climates to simulate hydrological characteristics at a high spatial resolution (river flow regimes, variability in runoff regime over time, etc.).  The results of these studies will be used to provide quantitative information on the possible changes in the effects of climate change for regional and catchment scales for selected water use systems across the EC (Alicromon basin in Greece, Rhine river, water supply system in southern England) and to develop procedures for adapting reservoir management to changing conditions.  Sensitivity test of the hydrological regime of the Rhine basin and selected sub-basin to land use change, will be made to establish baseline trends in order to compare the effects of future climate change with past variability and future effects of non-climate changes. The hydrological models used by the participants will differ in methodology, time step and spatial domain, according to the requirements of the specific study. The outputs of the models will however be comparable and produce a consistent set of project results for the catchment, regional and EC scale. Most of the models to be used already exist, and will need to be adapted and implemented for the purpose of the project; the remainder require development largely in order to produce comparable results across larger regions.  A range of scenarios will be developed by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia for transient changes in monthly rainfall, temperature and potential evaporation over the period 1990 to 2100, at a spatial scale of 0.5º x 0.5º . They will be created by rescaling the standardised output from a number of state--of--the--art global climate model simulations according to the transient global temperature change as determine for a given emissions scenario from one--dimensional model. All the studies will use the same set of scenarios, and steps will be taken to ensure that the scenarios developed for the current project are consistent with scenarios that may be applied in other EC climate change impact assessments.",1,1
950,41717,No,High-level fuzzy control of complex processes,"Fuzzy systems have been recognised as an attractive alternative to classical control schemes for the low-cost and simple design of the control laws of imperfectly known, non-linear and complex processes. Fuzzy control has been successfully applied to a large number of consumer products and industrial processes, but the applications reported are usually at low control level.  However, the definition of fuzzy sets itself suggests that the most appropriate use of fuzzy systems is at higher levels of control. Therefore, the great potential of this approach is at supervisory and planning levels where human knowledge is involved in a decision making process.  The proposed research work consists of the development of a new generation of fuzzy controllers, dedicated to high-level control, thus, able to deal with several, possibly hierarchical, control levels and different control goals. The developed fuzzy controllers will be applied to different non-linear complex processes to evaluate their performance.",0,0
485,211501,No,Introduction of an online hydrogen sulphide analytic device for the creation of an efficient andeconomical and ecological sustainable waste water infrastructure in Europe,"Our waste water consists of many dissolved and undissolved substances from industrial, commercial and domestic waste water. This results in a special environmental problem within the sewer: hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The effects of H2S are drastic. Economically very high infrastructure costs arise in our sewage system resulting from sulphuric acid corrosion (investment needs Europe > 250 bn €). Ecologically it is proven that an increasing bulking sludge formation results which is fatal for the microbiology in a sewage plant. In order to eliminate H2S, high amounts of chemicals are currently pumped through the European sewage system. But the use of chemicals could be drastically reduced when measures would be taken already at the point of origin in the waste water collection point, which prevent the H2S formation selectively. For this purpose, a measurement procedure is necessary that can register on-site and online the H2S concentration. We, the ECH, have successfully managed to develop a new measurement method that is solving this problem. Objective of the SME Phase 1 is a feasibility study for an H2S analyzing device (TRL 6). Target customers are municipal and private companies of the waste water industry, industrial sewage treatment plants, contract laboratories (market volume 200-500 m €). The advantages of the H2S-Analyzer are: Technology: - Measurement of smallest H2S incidences from 0,01 ppm - Fast measurements (<10 min) - automatized online measurement Ecologically: - Proofed reduction of chemicals use for the treatment of H2S at least 40-50% Economically: - Reduction of expenditures for replacement investments in the waste water infrastructure - Cost savings of at least 40 % due to the low use of chemicals The H2S-Analyzer is as a key factor of the ECH and will lead to significant increases in the company´s turnover, increase of employees and in the long-term to a lower use of chemicals in the sewer industry.

If the reliability of flood risk assessment is to be improved, there is a critical need to specifically extend the record of the instrumental period (systematic period) of extreme floods. This record is usually limited to only a few dozens of years and the largest floods are therefore under-rated in the data. Information on hydrological variability and extreme floods can be completed using either or both palaeo flood hydrology (new and developing branch of hydrology and geomorphology based on geologic indicators) and/or historical information (based on documents and chronicles). Long records of extreme floods are then applied successfully in the risk analysis, together with the more traditional empirical, statistical and deterministic methods to estimate the largest floods. These extreme floods are of most interest to the planners and engineers but rarely feature in the systematic period. This information is especially useful for floodplain management, design of hydraulic structures, flood hazard reduction, management of riparian ecosystems and flood emergency plans (i.e. sustainable floodplain development). The recent catastrophic floods in Europe warn of the critical need for Paleo-hydrologic data on floods over long-time scales. SPHERE aims at developing new scientific frameworks and technical tools integrating multidisciplinary approaches (geologic, historical, hydraulic, statistical and GIS) on extreme flood risk assessment. In particular, a complete catalogue of major past floods will be constructed for an area in France and one in Spain Scientific objectives and approach The main objectives of SPHERE include: 1) the use of palaeohydrological geological evidence (floods over the last 5000 years) and historical information (floods over the last 600 years) to develop a catalogue of past extreme floods corresponding to different regions, and to improve existing methodologies developed for palaeoflood reconstruction and adapting and modifying them to the particular European conditions, in terms of geographical, physiographical and climatic characteristics. 2) improving the understanding of hydraulic processes and numerical models by developing methods of treating historical and palaeoflood data to estimate peak discharges using 1D or 2D hydraulic models, according to the geometric and geomorphologic characteristics of the river or stream (alluvial or bedrock channels). 3) the development of statistical tools for Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA); these tools will serve to address problems related to the use of non-stationary and non-systematic data. Measurement of the interest in non-systematic data for FFA will be provided by Monte Carlo simulation and application to the different case studies using long palaeoflood and historical series. The efforts proposed should help identify new directions for the use of non-systematic information in FFA. 4) the design of a practical system for the analysis of systematic and non-systematic flood data at the regional and local level using GIS procedures including flood frequency analysis and hydrological modelling. This is measurable and verifiable in terms of the capacity of the system to produce maps of historical and palaeoflood distribution (for single events, specific time intervals, etc.), data analysis (frequency and magnitude distribution of extreme events through long-time spans) and statistical analysis using systematic and non-systematic data. 5) the development of flood risk decision making tools to be applied at different scales (from a single river reach to a drainage basin on a regional scale) that will be readily available to evaluate dam safety, spillway dimensions for high-magnitude low-frequency flooding, flood hazard mapping (especially in urban areas) etc. These tools will be based on the system obtained according to point 4. The measurability is given by the capacity of the system to include data regarding dams and flood protection structures within the basin showing their limitations for high magnitude flooding. In addition, the visual capacity of the system will be used in risk education and civil protection with regard to long-term flooding. The GIS will provide the appropriate tool to gain knowledge on the areas suffering large flood events over the last centuries. 6) the establishment of short- and long-term relationships between climate and floods in areas with different climatic features: evolution, trends and approximation to a return period. To diagnose, classify and compare different meteorological synoptic patterns responsible for rainfall and floods in Europe, to improve flood forecasting and storm tracking. 7) the preparation of a methodological guide for climate/flood data collection and the temporal analysis of the data. The design of general methodology for the hydrometeorological analysis of floods as an attempt to standardise the scientific-technical reports concerning these events. Expected impacts: Palaeoflood and historical flood data are presently used in several countries at the national scale to construct a catalogue of past flood events. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has released a special program for reconstructing palaeofloods (using geological indicators), to evaluate dam safety and to aid in hydrologic dam safety decisions and in the management of reservoirs. The Hydrological Survey of Israel considers palaeoflood data to be essential for flood hazard estimation and even for that of water resources. China also approaches the evaluation of flood frequency and magnitude using historical flood data to both define the limits of flood hazards and to design engineering structures. Several projects on flood risk have been launched by the European Commission. These mostly involve hydrological forecasting using radar or hydro meteorological data from the instrumental record. None of these projects take into account the vast quantity of past flood information for the purpose of flood risk assessment. The project here presented represents a step-forward in that it sets out to quantify real events occurring at a given basin over several millennia and to apply this information in the flood frequency analysis. In most of the studied drainage basins, the estimated discharges from palaeofloods and historical floods exceed those recorded by instrumental flood series, illustrating that an improved knowledge of extreme events can be gained from geological and documentary evidence. In NE Spain, the SPHERE project has shown that events during the last 400 years produced discharges upto 30% greater than the biggest gauged flood events of this century (the 1962 and 1971 events). Some of the floods witnessed in the summer of 2002 in Central Europe and in the south of France have been designated the largest since instrumental records began. However, some of these discharges were lower than those estimated using palaeoflood and/or historical flood evidence e.g. Gardon River, France. These results indicate that paleoflood studies can provide a better view on the magnitude of the largest floods that can affect a drainage basin. New methods on palaeoflood analysis have been developed including: (1) a systematic procedure of collecting, storing and analysing slackwater flood deposits, (2) advances in chronological constrains using multiple dating methods such as TL, OSL, radiocarbon dating (AMS) and Caesium-137.  Documentary flood data is available at almost any major city of Europe and it is a valuable source to understand the societal impacts of flooding. Detailed descriptions on water levels, economic losses, casualties and socio-economic disruption associated to different flood magnitudes can be used in flood management and education. In three studied rivers in Spain, over 1000 documents were used, whereas in France a similar number were available from the General State Sources. This information was compiled and stored in the SPHERE databases. The uncertainties of the historical flood discharge estimation is minimised by taking into account the local topography and infrastructures present near the river at the time of the flood, whereas in palaeoflood discharge estimations best estimations are obtained on bedrock or resistant river reaches.  The SPHERE Project has revealed the complementarity of palaeoflood and historical flood information. Past flood records in terms of time and discharge were completed using a combination of both types of data sources. In terms of risk planning the traditional method of using only hydrological data or hydrometeorological calculations should be modified. This information has been shown to be insufficient in the absence of long-term gauge records. As part of the SPHERE project, new user-friendly software (FRESH) run in a windows environment has been developed for the calculation of return periods incorporating palaeoflood and historical flood data. New mathematical procedures on FFA (Flood Frequency Analysis) and high return period quantiles using upper bounded probability distribution functions have been explored for high-risk infrastructures (dam safety, nuclear power plants, etc) based on a combination of palaeoflood, documentary and systematic data together with upper flood limits based on the envelope curve and PMF (Probable Maximum Flood) estimation. The reliability of the high return period quantiles and the PMF estimates can be computed using Monte Carlo simulations. In the flood series derived from palaeoflood and historical data, periods of increases in flood magnitude and/or frequency are observed over the last 3000 years (e.g. late Bronze Age and 16-17th centuries AD).  This indicates that climatic variability clearly effects flood magnitude and frequency. These past flood-climate relationships can be used for a better understanding of the potential effects of the present Greenhouse Global Warming. Non-stationarity of the flood record is not surprising, given that it may also be evident within instrumental series of 50 years length. Furthermore, non-stationarity is predicted in current scenarios of future climate change. Tools should be developed that allow quantification of the non-stationarity of a flood series and new procedures in flood frequency analysis of mixed populations. Flooding was produced by distinct circulation patterns (CPs). At basins with Mediterranean fluvial regime, CPs are defined by local parameters of the basin (e.g. Ardeche, Llobregat), whereas in basins with an Atlantic regime (e.g. Isere) CPs producing floods can be identified from both National (France) and European CPs classifications. The physical evidence of the water level reached during a past flood event provides clear and tangible evidence of flood risk in a given area and, therefore, should be used as an invaluable education tool in risk education. Data integration and analysis were performed by digital databases supported by a standardised and compatible database management system, namely the SPHERE GIS. About 6000 past flood records were stored.",1,0
1060,59777,No,INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL/CONFERENCE ON NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY AND QUANTUM GROUPS,"The purpose of the International Stefan Banach Mathematical Centre school/conference on 'Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Groups' is twofold. The first aim is to provide an introduction and training in some of the mainstreams of geometry of noncommutative spaces and both algebraic and analytic theories of quantum groups by means of appropriate series of survey lectures. These survey lectures are designed to introduce the audience into the state-of-the-art of the following main research topics: Noncommutative Index Theory and Hopf Symmetry, Baum-Connes Conjecture Locally Compact Quantum Groups, Galois Type Extensions of Noncommutative Algebras.  The second goal is to enable an efficient communication of most recent results and enhance the mutual understanding among researchers working on different but strongly related aspects of quantum geometry. The hope is to encourage people to undertake research in these advanced and rapidly growing areas of mathematics, and to achieve the synergetic effect of cross-fertilization by combining complementary fields of expertise. Modern mathematical research frequently runs across the classical division of mathematics into particular subjects. The afore-stated combination of topics brings together algebra, analysis, differential geometry and K-theory techniques to address concrete mathematical problems, programmes and theories that were born in recent years. This bringing together of expertise ranging from pure algebra to functional analysis proves the particularly interdisciplinary character of this meeting. On the other hand, the well-focused programme of the school conference organizes this wide range of mathematical knowledge into coherent and manageable pieces. ftp://ftp.cordis.lu/pub/improving/docs/HPCF-2001-00295-1.pdf",0,0
447,104679,No,IMProved multivariate frequency Analysis of flood extremes by copuLAs in a non-stationary environment,"'One of the biggest challenges of the flood frequency analysis that water resources managers have to face recently is modelling two or more inter-dependent flood variables (floods at river confluences; flood and the respective volumes and durations), and accounting for the non-stationarity of the environment. The IMPALA project offers multidisciplinary solution to this problem by copula-based multivariate frequency modelling of flood extremes with the inclusion of information on historical and regional ungauged extremes and respecting the effects of the changing environment, including further development of methods for spatial data extension and their verification on a Europe-wide scale. Copulas are novel and flexible statistical tool suitable for frequency modelling of multivariate flood extremes. Nevertheless, their application is not trivial, and additionally, the general lack of the available data in the extreme spectrum of the joint distribution makes the flood risk assessment unreliable. The project IMPALA is aimed at improving the multivariate frequency modelling of flood characteristics by increasing the density of the observations in the extreme tails of the marginal distributions. This will be reached by direct inclusion of extraordinary flood data into a univariate flood frequency analysis of marginals, by means of the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Depending on the type of the extraordinary data, different strategies will be adopted: (a) flood extremes from ungauged catchments will be included using a regional approach and the stationary concept, while (b) historical flood extremes will be included using the local approach and the non-stationarity assumption. The project IMPALA will take advantage of existing pan-European databases of streamflow records and catchment descriptors such as those held by the FRIEND or HYDRATE projects, and data from the relevant gauging authorities in Slovakia and Austria.'",0,0

167,193853,Yes,"Applying European market leadership to river basin networks and spreading of innovation on water ICT models, tools and data","WaterInnEU’s primary vision is to create a marketplace to enhance the exploitation of EU funded ICT models, tools, protocols and policy briefs related to water and to establish suitable conditions for new market opportunities based on these offerings. WaterInnEU will build upon existing knowledge bases and platforms developed in previous projects but will provide new concepts, connections, and components that are essential for a marketplace to work.  The primary goals can be detailed in five major objectives: a) Gather the outcomes of previous European funded projects, and contribute to their dissemination and exploitation to be used as an instrument for supporting the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD).  b) Assess the level of standardization and interoperability of these outcomes as a mechanism to integrate ICT-based tools, and incorporate open data platforms and generate a palette of interchangeable components that are able to use the water data emerging from the data sharing processes and data models stimulated by initiatives such as the INSPIRE directive. c) Create the marketplace as a service: a forum formed by water research projects representatives, stakeholders in the water domain, and companies (in particular SMEs), who are capable of moving current products into the market and offer them to, for example, river basin managers, at different levels. The user segment will mainly benefit from the capability of the water partnerships (e.g. the Global Water Partnership), in bringing together a wide variety of water sector stakeholders and practitioners such as decision makers, public and private users, local, regional and international entities, multidisciplinary stakeholders. d) Build an open virtual marketplace that includes the Water Knowledge Portal of projects and research (WISE-RTD), a user feedback facility and a success stories portfolio, additionally to the current tools and policies lists.",0,1
472,92609,No,Computational neuroimaging: quantitative models of human visual neurons,"One of the most complex systems, often referred to as science’s last frontier, is the human brain. However, human neuroscience research is constrained; it has no or rarely access to invasive procedures that are widely used in animals. Invasive procedures allow measurements at much smaller scales, e.g. at level of individual neurons. Consequently, most knowledge of human neurons is extrapolated from animal experiments. Ultimately, at least some human and animal neuronal properties will differ, making human measurements at comparable scales essential. We propose to bridge this gap by coupling non-invasive human neuroimaging signals, measured at the millimetre scale, with neuronal properties, measured at the micron scale. We will use a new computational neuroimaging method, which measures human neuronal population properties that are close to those derived from invasive animal experiments (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008). The utility of these methods extends from basic to applied neuroscience, as supported by initial observations in both rare, i.e. achiasma, and common disorders, i.e. macular degeneration a leading cause of visual impairment. Thus, this method has both fundamental and clinical applications. We will extend this method in three ways. First, we will extend this method from human population to single neuron estimates. We require that our estimates replicate well-established animal experiments and human behavioural data. Second, we will validate the measurements with predictions derived from an established theoretical framework. The ability to confirm basic observations is crucial for correct interpretations of potential differences. The current theoretical framework was established using artificial stimuli that are supposed to extrapolate to natural conditions. However, recent studies suggest that this extrapolation capability is limited. Third, we will extend this method to build more complex models of neuronal properties under natural viewing conditions.",0,0

The CA will focus on tick-host-pathogen interactions to identify concrete means of control that reduce the prevalence of TBD in (sub)tropical countries. The project will generate a clu ster of integrated databases for ticks, hosts and pathogens, crucial for correct identification of ticks and precise differential diagnosis of pathogens.

1228,103515,No,Latin in Old Norse-Icelandic Manuscripts,"'Dr. Jensson, a professor of comparative literature and classics at the University of Iceland, proposes to develop a comprehensive description of Latin letters in medieval Old Norse-Icelandic manuscripts at the Department of Scandinavian Research, University of Copenhagen. This entails a two-year Work Programme in Copenhagen to compile an analytical state-of-the-art XML database offering full informational coverage of Latin works, composed, copied, translated or otherwise utilized by Old Norse-Icelandic scribes. Few original texts in Latin are preserved in Old Norse-Icelandic manuscripts compared with the great number of Icelandic vernacular works. This seems to underlie a common but inaccurate assumption that medieval literacy in the area was radically exceptional in western and central Europe with respect to the use of Latin. But if one documents the number of known and lost original Latin works, references to the use of Latin in Iceland and Norway, Latin texts found in Old Norse-Icelandic manuscripts, vernacular translations of Latin works, lists of Latin books that were in the libraries of churches, monasteries and cathedral schools, and Latin sources identified in the vocabulary collection of the Dictionary of Old Norse Prose, a very different picture emerges of medieval Icelandic-Norwegian literacy and one that is much less exceptional with respect to the use of Latin. By compiling a database of XML-encoded documents related to Latinity which is compatible with and supplementary to the Dictionary of Old Norse Prose online (dataonp.hum.ku.dk) and the Online Electronic Catalog of Icelandic Manuscripts (handrit.org), two projects presently under construction at the Department in Copenhagen, the foundation of a new knowledge portal based on new insights will be laid. The project will establish Dr. Jensson as a leading European scientist in the area of Scandinavian Latin, and contribute further to a world-leading European centre of manuscript studies in Copenhagen.'",0,0
610,219181,No,automatic detection and localization of High frequency Oscillation in Paediatric Epilepsy,"In spite of the continuous development of new drugs that target molecular mechanisms responsible for generating epileptic seizures, approximately 25% of the patients with epilepsy are proven medically resistant. These patients should be evaluated for surgery to remove the area responsible for generating the attacks referred to as the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Surgical outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the recognition of the EZ, which is currently identified using a potential range of diagnostic tests. In such cases, long-term intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) monitoring is used to correctly characterise the seizures and establish the surgical approach. iEEG monitoring has however its limitations, which are mainly found in its invasiveness, cost and the limited spatial sampling - i.e. the chance to record activity propagated from other close areas and not originated where electrodes are placed. To date, this results in a significant number of patients continuing to experience postsurgical seizures.  During the last few years, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs above 80 Hz) have emerged as a new promising biomarker in pre-surgical diagnosis of epileptogenicity. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the resection of the tissue generating HFOs improves surgical outcome in patients with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE). HOPE aims to facilitate the interaction between academic, clinical industrial partners to produce a step-change in our ability to detect and quantify HFOs using non-invasive investigations like EEG and MEG, tackling the existing limitations at computational, hardware and software level. As the HFOs are a paradigmatic case for signal detection in low signal/noise condition, the technology will also benefit research in neurofeedback and BCI recordings and allow is to develop and evaluate a neurofeedback platform for the self-modulation of HFOs, and it’s relevance to clinical management of MRE.",0,0

579,72326,No,Mapping underground aquifers using direct-current resistivity and induced polarization.,"The main research objective is to assess the capabilities of direct-current resistively and induced. polarization methods to provide reliable and extensive hydro geological information of practical use. The sustainable management of groundwater resources necessitates the definition of protection measures in sensitive areas. An extensive and enough detailed cartography is therefore needed and should be possibly linked to transport properties. Wells provide a direct, but very localized access to hydraulic parameters. A good quality interpolation between the wells requires the use of geophysical methods Among them, DC resistively and induced polarization is of particular interest because of their sensitivity to water content, salinity and porosity in ground materials. They now enable a 3D imaging of large volumes at a relatively low cost. Since their capabilities depend on the geological context, we propose an assessment of their performance and limits on at least two test sites. At first, two different sites will be selected, gathering the relevant available documentation. A preliminary numerical study will help to define a measurement procedure for the measurement campaign that will follow. The resistively and induced polarization data will be jointly interpreted, using a priori information, to build an image of the hydro geological structure. The results will be assessed considering hydro geologists' needs. If necessary, an improved methodology will be proposed. Long-term aims are the definition of applicability and limits of the methods, regarding their reliability and use at a large scale. The results will be part of a database, this allowing later improved processing's and comparisons with other methods.",0,0
143,217414,Yes,"A cost effective, self-calibrating, low maintenance pH sensor for an integrated approach to monitoring sea and drinking water, facilitating improvements in ocean, animal and human health","ANB Sensors (ANB) is a company set up to develop the next generation of pH Sensors for oceanographic, source water and aquifer monitoring and water resource management applications. In a short period of time, ANB has won innovation awards and grant funding and registered intellectual property (IP) (3 patents pending with a further 5 patents in the filing stage) covering new, fundamental pH sensor technology. The key failing of existing pH sensors is the short life and high maintenance costs of the sensors, which is a result of reference electrode drift giving unreliable measurements. The impact of reference drift is that most current ISE sensors cannot be used for long duration monitoring, cannot be used autonomously in smart sensor networks and require frequent, labour intensive calibrations. The only solution to reference drift currently available is expensive manual calibration. ANB’s innovative pH sensor, the pHenom, is based on a voltammetric electrochemical technique, which utilises a pH responding molecule bound within a solid-state matrix. This is combined with a novel means of verifying the performance of the pHenom’s reference electrode through an additional in-situ electrochemical measurement. For the first time, the pHenom sensor provides a pH sensor that is capable of smart, networked sensing allowing companies and government funded agencies to use their scarce monitoring management resources more efficiently. ANB’s overall objective for this project, therefore, is to develop the pHenom technology to the point where it can be placed on the market as-soon-as-possible, through technology licensing and sales. To meet this objective, in this project ANB will develop and produce four commercial prototype sensor systems specifically tailored for the biggest pH sensor market, the water monitoring and management industry. These commercial prototypes will be used to demonstrate the operational advantages of the pHenom technology to gain market acceptance.",0,1

We will study large classes probability distributions of geometric origin on spaces of a very high dimension, tending to infinity. A particular, important case is the uniform measure on an arbitrary high-dimensional convex body. Even though the latter class of probability distributions is quite diverse, we observe that some non-trivial principles persist. For instance, any uniform measure on a high-dimensional convex set necessarily has some approximately gaussian marginals. The recent years have seen progress in the analysis of such high-dimensional measures. The proposed project intends to deepen and extend these first signs of understanding, to contribute towards a comprehensive theory of convexity-related measures, and to develop new methods for the study of high-dimensional distributions in general.",0,0

681,31749,No,European river margins: Role of biodiversity in the functioning of riparian systems,"River margin ecosystems are a dynamic interface between terrestrial and aquatic environments where biological processes and biodiversity tend to be maximized. Recent evidence suggests that river margin ecosystems are highly sensitive to global regional and local environmental changes. The ERMAS Programme was established in 1992 to increase our understanding of the processes controlling the structure and function of river margin ecosystems through cooperative research involving a European-wide network.  ERMAS II develops the activity of this network by focusing on the role of biodiversity (i.e. autogenic processes) in determining the sonRitivity of river margin ecosystems to changes in environmental conditions (particularly temperature and hydrology). The proposed programme combines three primary research tasks:  a) to understand the role of biodiversity in maintaining the structure, functio and stability of ecosystems;  b) to analyse ecosystem processes with particular reference to the organic matt cycle;  c) to determine and compare interactions and links between ecosystem processes and physical processes in contrasting situations, defined at two scales: climat region and patch.  The ERMAS network includes a latitudinsl gradient from 64°N to 43°N, and a climatic gradient from sub-polar, to maritime temperate, mediterranean, and temperate continental. The possible introduction in ERMAS II of a Swiss team would add a site with an alpine climate. Locally, a gradient of sites will be chosen to characterize a representative range of hydro-geomorphological and management-impacted settings.  ERMPS II will apply a set of core protocols and extensions of these protocols to investigate important problems that are specific to some rivers. The core focuses on the influence of litter type and quality (including native v exotic) on carbon and nitrogen dynamics, invertebrate community diversity, and decomposition processes, in permanently submerged (i.e. the aquatic littoral) and frequently submerged sites.  The core protocols form a sequence of research steps, summarized as follows: l) a rigorous site selection protocol has been devised on the basis of (i) frequency and duration of inundation and (ii) sediment/soil characteristics, to facilitate comparisons between the different rivers.  2) a field-survey protocol has been developed to enable assessment of the variation of biodiversity in the riparian corridor at three spatial scales (between-rivers, between reaches, and between patches) in relation to environmental factors.  3) a simple experimental protocol will be used to establish the influence of single species and mixed species litter on decomposition processes, including the influence of litter derived from introduced and exotic species. 4A) an experimental protocol has been formulated to assess the influence of environmental conditions on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in monospecific and mixed stands of herbaceous species, such as Urtica dioica and IEpatiens glandulifera.  4B) an experimental protocol has been produced to establish relationships between litter type and diversity, and invertebrate diversity, and the role of invertebrates in litter decomposition The project will have benefits for both wealth creation and quality of life by provlding scientific information and a modelling approach to aid the development of sustainable management of land and water resources Keywords siodiversity Ecosystem processes Hydro-climatic gradient River margins",0,0
637,72996,No,Positional cloning of the gene causing the muscular hypertrophy of Texel sheep,"Belgian Texel sheep are characterized by an inherited muscular hypertrophy, controlled by a major locus mapped to the pericentric region of sheep chromosome 2. The purpose of this project is to identify the corresponding gene and mutation. Knowledge of t his gene will allow for more effective marker assisted selection, will open possibilities for targeted development of drugs that could be useful in the treatment of muscle wasting, and will identify a potential target for engineering using transgenic te chniques. Identification of the causal gene and mutation will be achieved by means of positional cloning. To that end we will first improve the genetic and comparative map of the region. Bovine BAC libraries will be screened with available microsatellit es in the region of interest. Fingerprinting contigs (FPC) including the positive BACs will be identified by searching the ICE database compiled by the Genome Sequence Centre, Vancouver, Canada (http://www.bcgsc.bc.ca/). Novel microsatellites will be iso lated from the corresponding BACs. BAG ends will be sequenced and BLAST searches will be performed against the human genomic sequences to identify orthologous anchorpoints. BAC ends corresponding to the extremities of FPC will be used as probes to scree n the BAG libraries, thereby completing the contig of the region by \\\'FPC walking\\\'. Genetic fine-mapping will be accomplished with the new markers by exploiting linkage in the available F2 pedigree, and by exploiting linkage disequilibrium analysis within the Belgian Texel population (all double-muscled Belgian Texel are expected to share a common haplotype spanning the causal gene). We will identify (b)ovine cDNAs orthologous to the genes mapping to the corresponding human region using the EGO d atabase available from TIGR (http://www.tigr.org/), and assemble spotted cDNA microarrays including all these positional candidates.",0,0

But it has a problem: Most EU citizens don’t care about some Brussels agency they never heard of. The solution is in the ERC’s mandate: frontier research. It has science – the cutting edge variety, that can capture the imagination, change the world and stimulate curiosity. We have seen the power of a fundamental science story elsewhere, and how it can focus attention on the institution behind it: the Higgs boson and CERN.  It takes high scientific achievement, great story-telling, a tight focus, creative communications and a sustained effort to build a mass following in science. We believe the ERC can achieve this – to matter as the source of cool science, to students, investors, policy makers, researchers, and all citizens generally, in all 28 EU member-states and beyond. The ERC can invent science and mirror it back to society. In short, ERC = ScienceSquared.  To convey this message, the ERC = ScienceSquared campaign will promote ERC projects and grantees through a cluster of innovative, popular and high quality content packages – punchy videos, long-form ‘snowfall’ articles, tiny Tweets, augmented reality, ‘pop-up’  displays – which will be adapted to a new research theme every six months. The content packages will be used in ten science museums, 34 universities, hundreds of online media channels and many other outlets covering 37 countries. These will be sustainable communication channels, which the ERC can continue using when the contract is over, targeting key audience segments: more than 40 million people. This campaign – as ‘cool’ as the ERC itself - will stir interest in science, raise awareness of the ERC as a science power, build broader political and societal support for the ERC – and encourage grant applications from a new generation of researchers, especially in countries under-represented among ERC grantees.",0,0
1235,106576,No,HYDRODYNAMIC TRANSPORT IN ECOLOGICALLY CRITICAL HETEROGENEOUS INTERFACES,"Physical, biochemical and ecological processes in natural water bodies have been the subject of intense research over the past decades by scientists of different expertise. Environmental studies related to natural water bodies are a relatively new area of research, spanning over no more than fifty years. The dawning of environmental studies in the late 20th century has seen developments mainly confined to individual classical areas of expertise, with relatively small degree of interactions among specialities. The development of a truly interdisciplinary approach to environmental studies in a holistic perspective appears one of the main challenges of the new century. This project aims at the training of new technical and scientific figures which can bring innovation in environmental applications and problem solving. The training activity will cover the transport of inorganic and organic matter, including solutes, colloids and sediments in river flows and across the boundary interfaces. Understanding of transport mechanism is a predestined stepping stone towards the ability to assess the vulnerability of the natural environment to anthropogenic stresses. The crucial role of heterogeneities of the stream geometry, of the nature and composition of interfacial matter, and of transported matter, will be emphasized by appropriate experimental and mathematical tools. Direct observations and measurements of transport and ecological processes, using up-to-date instrumentation and investigation procedures, will play a major part in the research and training programme. The participation of the private sector in the training activities will be a key element to guarantee the direct transfer of methods and results into the professional and technical market. The trainees will build specific competence in modern environmental technologies, achieve state-of-the-art knowledge and practical skills building on an existing academic degree in engineering or environmental sciences.",0,0

Carreira the researcher will work with two of the world’s leaders in organic chemistry in the complementary areas of methodology development and natural product synthesis, respectively. In the outgoing phase a novel, asymmetric, Lewis base activated, Lewis acid catalysed reaction will be developed to allow for the asymmetric chlorofuntionalization of activated carbon-carbon double bonds. This objective will be achieved through the thorough screening of reaction profile with respect to Lewis acid, Lewis base, electrophile and trapping agent and through the analysis of reaction kinetics using techniques such as ReactIR and rapid-injection NMR spectroscopy. The Denmark group’s experience in this area, built up over the last 15 years, will allow for efficient iteration and optimisation of the protocol. In the return phase application of the developed methodology towards the synthesis of the chlorosulfolipid family of natural products is planned, along with the transferring of the obtained knowledge/skills to European researchers. Specifically, this will be achieved through the mentoring of junior students. The proposed research and research plan is specifically designed to test and develop the researchers leadership qualities and ability for independent study as well as to provide experience and knowledge in an area of increasing importance. The ultimate ambition of the researcher is to obtain and sustain a successful, independent academic position in a European institution.

This cause major threat and risks to our most valuable water resource and on ecosystems dependent on groundwater. New information is need on how to better protect groundwaters and groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) from intensive land-use and climate change. The impacts of land-use changes and climate changes are difficult to separate as they partly result in similar changes in the ecosystems affected. The effects are highly interwoven and complex.   The EU groundwater directive (GWD) and the water framework directive (WFD) provide means to protect groundwater (GW) aquifers from pollution and deterioration. At present, the maximum limits for groundwater pollutant concentrations have been set for nitrate and various pesticides. Also, water of sufficient quality and quantity should be provided to ecosystems dependent on groundwater.   The European aquifers differ by their geology, climate, and threats to aquifers. This must be considered when general guidelines for management of these systems are developed. The concept of the present proposal is to base the research on different relevant aquifer sites in various European countries to test scientific issues and find new results to important problems.    Seven WP are foreseen:  WP1 Case studies on impacts and threats to GWs and GDEs   WP2 Groundwater dynamics, re-charge and water balance  WP3 Leaching to groundwater aquifers from different land-uses   WP4 Groundwater dependent ecosystems: groundwater-surface water interaction   WP5 Modelling processes in groundwater systems  WP6 Concepts, scenarios and risk assessment   WP7 Co-ordination",1,1

1274,54334,No,Cluster for Electronic COMmerce,"Standardization must be based on sound applied science and research work in order to reflect market needs. This is particularly true in the ICT area. To wait until research programmes have reached their conclusion before considering standardization of existing technical specifications may results in long delays and additional costs. Experience shows that standards emerging from cooperative research have a higher rate of success in international consensus building processes. An important contribution to the competitiveness of European industry on a global scale can be done if the need for standardization in R&D project is recognised at an early stage. This contributes to a faster development of the technical specifications involved and to their acceptance within world- wide markets.  Objectives: The objective of C-ECOM is to enhance co-operation among R&D projects with similar electronic commerce standards related objectives, in order to benefit from cross- fertilisation in the CEN/ISSS open environment. The C-ECOM Project will allow market players active in IST projects relevant to electronic commerce to benefit from a direct comparison with other similar projects where electronic commerce issues and the need of potential standards will be discussed. This will enable market players to implement a fast track for standardization, and, when appropriate, to start the process before the R&D projects have reached completion. Moreover, the close relationship between the actors involved will facilitate endorsement from industry, users, and other parties, and improve considerably the overall visibility of results.  Work description: The C-ECOM project aims at implementing an efficient feeding process into standardization. It will comprise the setting up of an open platform, dealing with the input of the IST projects contribution towards the appropriate bodies, following their development and keeping the constituent projects informed. This approach allows R&D projects to avoid the workload of dealing with several standardization bodies, while give them a high control over the outputs. In a very schematic way, the steps of the process are the following: A) The C-ECOM project will seek to examine the whole potential of approved projects. B) It will aim at obtaining participation to the open platform from at least 8/10% of the contacted projects. C) The projects participating in the cluster activity will be asked to give contributions to the platform in term of standard-related deliverables in the broad sense (guidelines, best practices, codes of conduct, technical specifications, etc). D) As far as the content of the contributions are concerned, the aim of the C-ECOM project is to enable IST projects under the current calls to feed the process with either material relating to their existing work or newly developed material.  The input will be followed up by the Project Manager, who will report to the open platform. Adequate measures will be taken on the basis of the response, in order to facilitate the development, through the most suitable channel, of standards related deliverables. In particular, the CEN/ISSS Workshop system offers a flexible approach to standardization, giving projects the opportunity to find solutions in an environment tailor-made for their needs. CEN/ISSS Workshop concept provides a unique opportunity for project consortia to dialogue with a wider constituency and to develop and promote project results validated by consensus in an open area.

Overcoming the challenge of water pollution requires novel water treatment technologies that are sustainable, robust and energy efficient. ELECTRON4WATER proposes a pioneering, chemical-free water purification technology: a three-dimensional (3D) nanoelectrochemical system equipped with low-cost reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based electrodes. Existing research on graphene-based electrodes has been focused on supercapacitor applications and synthesis of defect-free, superconductive graphene. I will, on the contrary, use the defective structure of RGO to induce the production of reactive oxygen species and enhance electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants. I will investigate for the first time the electrolysis reactions at 3D electrochemically polarized RGO-coated material, which offers high catalytic activity and high surface area available for electrolysis. This breakthrough approach in electrochemical reactor design is expected to greatly enhance the current efficiency and achieve complete removal of persistent contaminants and pathogens from water without using any chemicals, just by applying the current. Also, high capacitance of RGO-based material can enable further energy savings and allow using intermittent energy sources such as photovoltaic panels. These features make 3D nanoelectrochemical systems particularly interesting for distributed, small-scale applications. This project will aim at: i) designing the optimum RGO-based material for specific treatment goals, ii) mechanistic understanding of (electro)catalysis and (electro)sorption of persistent pollutants at RGO and electrochemically polarized RGO, iii) understanding the role of inorganic and organic matrix and recognizing potential process limitations, and iv) developing tailored, adaptable solutions for the treatment of contaminated water.",0,1
1135,78461,No,New Energy Efficient approach to the operation of Membrane Bioreactors for Decentralised Wastewater Treatment,"The Mediterranean basin is one of the poorest regions in the world in terms of water resources. An increased water consumption rate for irrigation purposes along with a high urban population growth, have had an adverse effect on water resources. Thus most groundwater resources in the Mediterranean area are at risk of being exhausted through overexploitation. With limited renewable water resources, most countries of the area have been driven to reuse their wastewaters. However, specially in the east and nort hern Mediterranean regions, wastewaters are inefficiently treated or even re-used directly without treatment for irrigation or sanitary purposes, serving as a carrier for diseases or causing water pollution when discharged to water bodies.In the last decad e, several water treatment technologies have been used in the region with little success on pathogens removal. Membrane bioreactor technology is a very promising alternative to those conventional water treatments for membranes act as a barrier against bact eria and viruses achieving a high degree of water depuration. However, most membrane bioreactors currently in use have very high running costs because of the high-pressure drop and high air-flushing rate required for their operation. The objective of this project is to study a new approach to the operation of membrane bioreactors. This study will include a comparison of the three leading hollow membrane technologies. The operating procedure to be studied is expected to yield very low energy consumption and reduced maintenance costs. These characteristics would make the bioreactors working in these conditions suitable to be operated in peri-urban areas of the Mediterranean basin, where expenditure in public services is a critical factor.",1,0

Contamination of water supplies by micropollutants such as metal ions, pesticides and pharmaceuticals is a major contributor to this water stress. These pollutants are released by industrial processes in the textile and manufacturing industries. Existing water treatment removes 99.96% of contaminants, but does not remove the 0.04% of micropollutants. Although the remaining contaminants seem small, they are a major problem as they are exceptionally difficult to capture but also highly toxic to humans and animals. CustoMem have developed a customisable selective nanocellulose media called CustoMem Granular Media (CGM) that is bioengineered to capture and remove all micropollutants including the 0.04% that cannot currently be removed.Customers benefit from a simple, low cost, low energy solution that is low maintenance.

The consortium includes 19 research institutes and five water boards and environment agencies. MARS will engage with ongoing and finalised European initiatives addressing related topics, thus acting as an integrating project. Work will be organised at the scales of water bodies, river basins and Europe; at each scale there is a direct link to water managers and decision makers. Nested within the scale structure, we will employ a suite of methods: flume and mesocosm experiments to better understand the effects of selected stressor combinations with a focus on extremes and hydrological stress; linkage of “abiotic” and “biotic” models to predict effects of stressor combinations at a river basin scale; large-scale data analysis employing existing databases, but including additional variables, to gain a Europe-wide overview of stress, status and ecosystem services.

VR will provide an environment that enables the involved persons to upload a CAD domain model, automatically and interactively derive an analysis model and manipulate the model according to specific problems. This process comprises automatic meshing and interactive refinement strategies as well as interaction facilities with the simulation. New visualisation techniques are developed to provide an intuitive simulation machine that assists the designer during a simulation loop. This machine should be able to display the results in real-time and should offer the possibility to interactively move and modify boundary conditions with a related adaptation of the analysis model for the simulation.  Objectives: The objective of this project is the development of an intuitive simulation framework based on virtual reality technology that enables integration of CAE tasks into VR to reduce the time intervals of modelling and evaluation procedures. As result the system will provide an intuitive virtual environment that enables a designer to upload a CAD domain model, automatically and interactively derive an analysis model and manipulate it, including intuitive automatic meshing and interactive refinement strategies as well as interaction facilities during the simulation. New visualisation techniques are developed and included providing an intuitive simulation machine that assists the designer during a simulation loop. The system will support a mode to conduct an interactive redesign of the basis domain and restart the simulation with modified parameters.  Work description: ViSiCADE will provide methodologies and tools whereby models at an appropriate level of detail can be analysed and offer the possibility to clarify design details when required. New interaction methods are developed to derive sub domains through a mesh API. It is envisaged to conduct rapid preliminary design optimisation on simpler analysis models in real-time rather than investigate a model of full complexity. This hierarchical approach will start an analysis from coarse models for a preliminary design evaluation and results in local models that enable the designer to clarify design details when required. Adaptive methods for solving the resulting equations have to be assessed and implemented. New visualisation methods for the display of the results will be implemented to enhance the evaluation stage. Aim is to keep the context to the CAD model (represented in VR format) and display CAD model and the results of an analysis within the interactively derived sub domain.  The possibility will be created to save VR-models in STEP-format. The development of an integrated event driven CAE/VR system using grid technologies will enable the operation of such a system in a distributed computing environment. The computational grid would include parallel systems, user workstations database servers, and Visualisation engines and a FEM control mechanism as central enabling technology. Access to HPCN (High Performance Computing) facilities is considered to provide results for the virtual environment enabling the necessary computing power. The integration platform will aim to keep the link between CAD and VR by means of supporting STEP for exchange of geometry and FEM Data (ISO 10303 - Part 104) with the CAD System. It is envisaged to drive, extend and enhance this standard hence targeting industrial needs and providing a system that offers support for most of the available CAD Systems of the market.

483,93711,No,Threedimensional Adaptive Camera with Object Detection and Foveation,"TACO develops a 3D sensing system with real 3D foveation properties endowing service robots with a higher level of motion and affordance perception and interaction capabilities with respect to everyday objects and environments. By 3D foveation properties we mean properties based on the process of acquiring 3D images with coarse level of details, applying fast object recognition techniques to identify areas of interest in the coarse 3D image and then concentrate the image acquisition on details of interest allowing for higher resolution 3D sampling of these details. This new 3D foveation concept will allow robots to interact with everyday environments in a more natural and human-like manner, increasing the level of detail whenever needed for interaction between the robot and everyday objects and humans. These 3D foveation properties are achieved by utilising the power of micro-mirror MEMS technology combined with state-of-the-art time-of-flight methods to ensure a system that is small, light-weight and easily mounted on an ordinary-sized service robot or even a robot arm. The project will explore control strategies for 3D foveation allowing 3D robot vision that is adaptable with space- and time-variant sampling, processing and understanding. The project will verify and test the 3D sensing system in a robotic environment, exploring the capabilities of the system to allow the robot to navigate autonomously and interact with a diverse number of everyday objects. The TACO consortium has RTD partners and industrial end users: Fraunhofer IPMS (micro-mirror scanning device), Fraunhofer IPM (3D range sensors), CTR (Electronics), SINTEF (3D foveation software), TU Wien (benchmarking with state-of-the-art 3D sensing methods), Shadow Robotics (application towards robot grippers) and Oxford Technologies (application towards robots for harsh environments)",0,0

Laulimalide is a highly potent antimitotic agent, isolated from marine sponges, which inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines at the low nanomolar level. By sharing the same microtubule-stabilising mechanism as TaxolÂ® and retaining activity against multidrug-resistant cancer cells, laulimalide presents a promising lead structure for the development of a new class of anti-cancer agents. In the proposed project, structurally simplified analogues of laulimalide will be designed and synthesised in order to investigate structure-activity relationships and the mechanism of action, as well as improving the chemical stability. In this context, the preferred bioactive conformation of laulimalide will be probed and the structural requirements for potent cytotoxicity explored.  The applicant will improve her research training and expand her knowledge in the synthesis of biologically active molecules with therapeutic potential, at the same time participating in multidisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry, biology and medicine. Moreover, she will work on a totally different topic from her PhD studies and thus acquire new knowledge and expertise. These additional skills and complementary experiences will lead in turn to an exceptionally well-trained researcher, with enhanced profess ional maturity and independence, providing lasting long-term benefits in her future career. In addition to the high scientific standards provided by this postdoctoral research experience, the fellow would profit from the excellent infrastructure and the opportunities to interact with leading scientists & young researchers of varying disciplines and nationalities, as well as collaborations with research groups in universities & industry with balancing expertise.",0,0

456,87540,No,Regional phytoplankton ecophysiology products for coastal waters from local and satellite measurements,"Anthropogenic eutrophication and pollution of coastal waters requires careful monitoring of their “biological health”. This is often done by measuring stocks or rates of production. Monitoring primary productivity of coastal waters will lead to a better understanding of their basic functioning, including their capacity to support fish stocks or to develop harmful phytoplankton blooms. Charting primary production in coastal waters is, however, hampered by their optical complexity and heterogeneity, which prevents both accurate extrapolation of ship-based measurements and the retrieval of the distribution of photosynthetic pigments from satellite imagery.  The Baltic Sea is extensively monitored with semi-autonomous water quality measurement systems (chlorophyll a, salinity, turbidity, temperature). These data can be used to improve the accuracy of remotely sensed parameters required to model primary production. In this project, ship-based measurements of phytoplankton photosynthetic activity are coupled to imagery from satellite platforms. An adapted Fast-repetition rate fluorometer with two excitation wavebands is deployed in the Baltic Sea, and novel satellite algorithms are developed for imagery of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The potential of the data assimilation to obtain reliable regional coverage of phytoplankton primary production is evaluated, paying special attention to the interpretation of spatial variation of photosynthetic activity in and around phytoplankton blooms that develop massively in the Baltic Sea every Spring and Summer.",0,0

This framework will be tested and applied to two prototypes: a cultural heritage/education application, for students and the general public and an architectural/urban planning design review application, for decision makers and the general public. To develop these applications, the project follows a 'constructivist' approach, combining innovative work in VR, simulation, data capture, visualisation graphics, and interface design to provide highly realistic yet interactive experiences where users actively participate in the construction of environments. Development will be driven by actual user requirements, through careful analysis for each case, and evaluated for its effectiveness.  Objectives: In CREATE we will develop a mixed-reality framework that will enable interactive construction of virtual scenes based on real sources, resulting in highly realistic and interactive experiences. In particular: i) We will design new methodologies to determine user requirements based on a human-centred, 'constructivist' approach to working and learning, with special attention to evaluation; ii) We provide a complete set of techniques for a realistic capture of real sites, that can subsequently be used in an impressive virtual reality displays; iii) We will develop, adapt and combine novel, visualisation, display and audio technologies based on the user requirements, to enable realism with interactivity, specifically for VR/AR/MR applications. Finally, we will build & exploit two prototypes, one for a cultural heritage/learning application, and one for and architecture/urban-planning application, incorporating more natural and usable interface approaches.  Work description: The CREATE work plan consists of the project management and dissemination & exploitation work packages as well as five technical work packages: 1) Case Study Definition, Design and Methodology, to define and design the specifications and methodology for the two case studies, the first concerning a cultural heritage/education prototype and the other concerning a urban planning/design review prototype, and thus aid in their integration and the development; 2) Data Collection and Overall Scene Construction, to acquire existing site data forming the basis for construction and reconstruction for the case studies; 3) VE Enhancement: Re-lighting, Rendering, Population and Sound, to choose, adapt and develop appropriate algorithms and methodologies to enhance virtual environments so that they can provide a highly realistic experience while supporting interactive use;  4) Prototype Integration and Interface, to bring together the results of the techniques developed in the other work packages, and to design and implement the interface, creating a prototype system which will be used in the two application scenarios, for cultural heritage and urban planning. In this package, integration will be performed to provide a visual, haptic and audio experience to the user; 5) Evaluation, where the goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the performed work and the technical choices, with respect to the fulfilment of the objectives as set and targeted by each of the case studies/prototypes. The consortium will ensure timely and widespread dissemination of the results, both in the scientific community and to industry and the general public. The exploitation plan is twofold, first with the direct usage of the full prototypes by end-user partners or other take-up mechanisms and second the technology transfer of the individual technological breakthroughs developed, either for data capture or VE enhancement, in sectors such as VR, computer games, postproduction.  Milestones: - User requirements on Cultural Heritage/Education and on Urban/Architectural Planning & Design applications; - On-site data acquisition Techniques and Novel Algorithms with Digitally produced reconstructions of two sites; - Design & Specifications for VE Enhancement Algorithms; - Prototype mixing immerse technologies, and integration of the new virtual reality algorithms for realistic experience.",0,0

Tilted peptides are short protein fragments able to destabilize lipid membranes. Tilted peptides can be function al protein motif involved in protein/membrane fusion processes and in other biological events related to the disruption of a hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface. In this program we aspire to obtain a fundamental understanding of the tilted peptides and their involvement in membrane fusion. In order to better understand the relationships between their lipid-destabilising activity and their properties, we will study the biophysical properties of four peptides (three tilted peptides and one non tilted peptide) with different techniques. With this mission we aim to uncover general principles that govern the structure and dynamics of tilted membrane peptides and to obtain a fundamental understanding of their architecture in relation to their function.  In particular, we will analyse the role of tilted peptide/lipid interactions in determining properties of proteins in membranes via an experimental approach using model membrane systems. We expect that our studies will provide new insight into the structure, function and dynamics of membrane proteins and how this is modulated by the lipid environment. The project will build on the knowledge and expertise that has been gained over the years in the laboratory in studying different aspects of protein-lipid interactions. This expertise ranges from advanced biophysical techniques to modern molecular biological approaches and from model membrane systems to intact biological membranes.

Actually, alloy steel moulds are used for the fabrication of low, mid and high series products. For mid and low series steel moulds are very expensive and they have excessive mechanical strength. Light alloys are now used with success in the production of prototypes for mould design optimization, that are adequate only for very short series, but they can be an interesting solution for low and mid series, if the surface resistance is improved. Ceramic hard coatings can be a solution for this problem. However, great difficulties related to the important mismatches between the mechanical and thermal properties of the Al alloys and the hard ceramic coatings lead to in service failure. In this project, this problem can be overcome by optimizing the system based in Ti-Al, with variable nitrogen contents, owing to the fact that Ti-Al (N) has high hardness and a much higher thermal expansion coefficient that traditional hard coatings which can significantly decrease the thermal stresses during the deposition.

C. elegans is a unique animal in which genetic interactions can be rapidly identified in vivo using RNA interference, and we recently used this system to construct the first genetic interaction network for any animal, focused on signal transduction genes. The first objective of this proposal is to extend this work and map a comprehensive genetic interaction network for this model metazoan. This project will provide the first insights into the global properties of animal genetic interaction networks, and a comprehensive view of the functional relationships between genes in an animal. The second objective of the proposal is to use C. elegans to develop and validate experimentally integrated gene networks that connect genes to phenotypes and predict genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale. The methods that we develop and validate in C. elegans will then be applied to predict phenotypes and interactions for human genes.

Advanced ceramics are crucial for new technologies and nano-tech applications addressed to thermo-mechanical and bio-medical applications, while traditional ceramics have a worldwide market and have been suggested as materials minimizing the impact on the environment (when compared to other finishing materials). It may seem surprising that the strong industrial production of ceramic components is still based on empirically engineered processes, often poorly understood and difficult to control (Ewsuk, 1997). Consequently, there is a relatively large production of rejects and still broad margins for further process optimization. To this purpose, in-depth scientific understanding of the production processing is required, in order to reduce costs of ceramic component design and manufacturing and to produce ceramic components more reproducibly with improved performance and reliability. In particular, forming by powder compaction, binder burnout and sintering are the most sensible processes (Reed, 1995; Rahaman, 2006).

In the last 50 years EU's infrastructure expenditure related to its GDP has declined by almost 50 percent. The result is an aged infrastructure much of which has been built with the technologies and systems developed in late 19th or early 20th century. The consequences are clearly visible: traffic delays, congestion, deficient bridges and structures, deteriorating roads and motorways and decaying buildings. Measures which help to reverse such decline will bring far reaching benefits. New construction systems using advanced composite materials have performance attributes of superior strength with less weight, enhanced durability, longer service life, ease of manufacture and rapid construction, are energy efficient and have environmental compatibility as they can also be produced from sustainable resources. ASSET's main objective is to develop a strong and light- weight independent decking or flooring system made of multi-cell prismatic pultruded advanced composite profiles used as structural components, to efficiently carry wheel loads in bridges and heavy loads in other building structures. The system will be developed in such a way that it may be applied as both a complete optimised structural system for small bridges and buildings, and also as a decking or flooring component of other structures in which it acts compositely with other members. The standardised pultruded profile can potentially be readily assembled into a multitude of structural shapes for a wide variety of structural applications. The proposed profile optimises the properties of the material and the manufacturing system and does not attempt to mimic profiles in conventional materials. The system will be developed in four progressive stages. The first stage addresses the development, design, manufacture and testing of a single profile and its components. On successful completion of this initial stage an independent deck unit will be assembled from the standardised profiles and tested (Stage 2). System development will continue by testing an assembled deck acting compositely with other structural members in Stage 3. Finally, at least one full size bridge to take live traffic will be constructed with the system as a demonstration project from financial resources made available by the End User Partner. The bridge(s) will then be monitored after completion of the project by the Client and data will be made available to all partners for future exploitation, acceptance by Authorities and proof of the technology. The team offers an integrated Consortium covering the full spectrum of disciplines in the construction process comprising a Client End User, (GB), who represents the initiator and provides links with Technical Approval and Maintenance Authorities. The Science Partner, (SE), provides the academic input into the basic research and application of materials technology and is world renowned for jointing technology. A Research Institute, (ES), will provide the testing expertise. The Composite Partner, (DK), will address the development and production aspects of materials and supply. The Project Co-ordinator, (GB), a civil engineering consultancy, will cover design aspects, numerical modelling techniques, rapid prototyping, specification and will bring its project management skills to managing the project. The Contracting Partner, (SE), will bring to bear experience of carrying out work in the field under all the conditions imposed by the management of existing traffic and the excesses of the environment. The Surfacing and Supplier, (NL), will develop surfacing materials which will bond to the profile and withstand to wear the traffic. ASSET offers the chance to develop an advanced construction system for building Tomorrows infrastructure using tomorrows technology. Brite Euram III Areas covered by the proposal are 2.2, 1.1, 2.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.4.",0,0
1061,226613,No,PatientDataChain - Blockchain approach to disrupt patient-provider medical records data exchange,"Setrio’s PatientDataChain blockchain-based technology is a game-changer for decentralizing infrastructure and building a trust layer in the healthcare value chain. This could dramatically reduce time delays, added costs, and human error that plague healthcare value chain today.   PatientDataChain has significant power to disrupt healthcare and put data in the hands of patients. PatientDataChain uses Smart Contracts to map patient-provider relationships (here the contract shows a list of references detailing the relationships between nodes on the blockchain). It also puts patient-provider relationships in the hands of the patient, giving them the ability to accept, reject, or modify relationships with healthcare providers such as hospitals, insurers, and clinics.   PatientDataChain gives patients and doctors an immutable log of healthcare records. It takes a different approach to incentivation for patients by giving access to anonymized healthcare data in exchange for sustaining the network. It breaks down the existing barriers that currently obstacle communication on patients’ journey along the health value chain. Thus, for the care pathway, the workflows and patient processes are streamlined. The solution improves care adherence, operational efficiency and patient experience thus leading to better health outcomes and lower costs.   PatientDataChain will lead to (i) an enhanced exchange of information among health players and stimulation of new synergies, (ii) a reduction of costs and simplification of procedures for demonstrating regulatory compliance, (iii) an increased awareness on patients’ data also among patients themselves together with a better understanding of their health journey, and (iv) generation of big data on the patients’ journey along the health value chain across sector, applications and regions as an unprecedented knowhow for the society, necessary to address emerging health risks.",0,0
1090,106824,No,Wireless distributed intelligent system for irrigation optimisation and early turf disease prevention and treatment on Golf Courses,"Recreational water use is usually a very small but growing percentage of total water use and is mostly tied to reservoirs. If a reservoir is kept fuller than it would otherwise be for recreation, then the water retained could be categorized as recreational usage. Recreational usage is usually non-consumptive. The report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), reveals that Europe has so far concentrated on increasing the supply of water rather than exploring ways to limit its demand. Golf courses are often targeted as using excessive amounts of water, especially in drier. Some governments have labeled golf course usage as agricultural in order to deflect environmentalist’s charges of wasting water. The objective of the project is the development of a system based on wireless and artificial intelligence which provides support to irrigation Golf course processes with a water saving of 33% minimum. By including On field underground sensing: i) Underground humidity; ii)Salinity underground iii) Underground NIR measurement iv) Underground temperature, V) soil Ph. Also On-surface sensing will be included: i) Visible color sight; ii) Filtered visible colour measurement; iii) Wind speed and direction. Also the system will include a number of Ambient sensing at different zones, Ambient temperature and weather forecast based on consensus. All the measurements are transmitted by means of low consumption battery powered wireless ZigBee technology with specific antenna design.  An Artificial Intelligence driven and ‘fools-proof’ software system and others, will use the sensor measurements information and others, such as 3D Golf course mapping and drainage, compacting soil degrees, weather forecast, etc…, will suggest the parameters for irrigation for the different zones, and also will inform of existing or coming turf diseases conditions and possible treatments if needed. Also an internet access to human experts is provided by the WaterGolf system.",1,0
668,93561,No,Biotechnology from desert microbial extremophiles for supporting agriculture research potential in Tunisia and Southern Europe,"The project BIODESERT aims to strengthen a molecular microbial ecology research platform already existing in Tunisia, which actively performs collaborative research for the development of straightforward strategies of Microbial Resource Management (MRM) for agriculture in arid environments. The final objective is to expand the existing platform and improving the related technical and research knowledge, for addressing agricultural problems and exploiting microbial biotechnology that can support the development of a bio-economy in Tunisia and North Africa. The idea behind BIODESERT is to create the conditions, in term of advanced research equipments and up-to-date know how, for developing research in the field of microbial applied biotechnology from the extremophiles living in the arid and desert environments characterizing Tunisia and North Africa. We believe that microorganisms living in these harsh environments hide important properties that could be exploited in agriculture for improving soil water retention, fertility and plant protection in arid ecosystems. For this purpose, BIODESERT intends to recruit three experienced researchers that will set up in the laboratory of the Tunisian partner a Microarray system, a Real Time-PCR and a confocal fluorescence microscope and will develop the most recent analytical techniques based on these advanced tools. The three researchers will benefit of training periods in two European laboratories (in Italy and Greece) that already use these technologies. These activities will result in the transfer of know how to the Tunisian partner that will be able to improve the research potential in the microbial biotechnology of arid ecosystem. By a careful dissemination strategy planned in the ambit of BIODESERT, the improved knowledge will be spread in the scientific environment and the society of Tunisia and other North African countries, promoting the application of MRM for improving agriculture sustainability in arid ecosystems.",0,0
171,57346,Yes,Water recyling and reuse by application of membrane bioreactors: textile and municipal wastewater as examples,"Limited water resources and increasing environmental pollution are main problems in most Third Countries. A new membrane bioreactor (MBR) system will be developed for recycling and reuse of wastewater. Textile and municipal wastewater as the main sources of wastewater in North Africa will be used for bench- and pilot-scale tests. Extremely low concentrated and germ free effluents can be achieved with MBR systems, producing only small amounts of excess sludge. The increased biodegradation requires a low cut-off (e.g. ultra filtration), which is not used in known MBR-systems. Nevertheless, the specific costs for wastewater reuse in Third Countries have to be reduced. New membrane materials, innovative module concepts and the combination with anaerobic bioreactors (less energy and CO2-production) will be used for reaching the proposed goals.",1,1
233,216328,Yes,HierARchical Multiscale NanoInterfaces for enhanced Condensation processes,"This proposal focuses on key challenges facing human society: continuously increasing global demands for electricity as well as potable drinking water. Our long term vision consists of developing solutions related to water utilization for significant enhancement in i) efficiency of thermal power generation and ii) water harvesting to reduce the shortfall in global fresh water supply. The novel concepts that we propose rely on the realization of: 1) Precisely engineered, random yet hierarchical interface nanotextures, also with, controllable directionality, 2) Introducing a new norm of random biphilicity in the above interfaces at the submicron level, 3) Realization of novel superhydrophobic membranes through controlled coating of commercial hollow fiber membranes. 4) Novel methods of nanometrology to precisely and rationally describe the complex interfaces. Concept 1 is related to heat transfer exchange via dropwise condensation, where we target lifetime performance relevant to industrial surface condensers, while maximizing their heat transfer coefficient by up to an order of magnitude. By employing concept 2 we target novel material systems focusing on dew water harvesting in humid environments. Concept 3 targets new surface modification approaches for commercial membranes to achieve high efficiency in water desalination while ensuring anti-biofouling. For all the three concepts described above, a key component of our work will be to ensure economic scalability, of the precisely controlled textures, to large surface areas so that they can be converted to industrial products. For achieving optimal design, quantification and repeatable manufacturability of the aforementioned systems, we will employ novel metrology methods for hierarchical surfaces (concept 4) which will provide important theoretical feedback and understanding of the influence of critical surface structural parameters, through the entire project duration.",1,1

559,102657,No,Modeling Milky Way History,"One of the biggest promises of astrophysics in the coming decades is to understand the history of our Galaxy and that of its immediate galactic vicinity. The European Union will play a key role in this effort through its cornerstone Gaia mission, which will map the Milky Way in unprecedented detail. Recovering the history of the Galaxy, however, will only be possible in concert with suitable theoretical models. We propose to carry out a research project at the University of Zurich, Institute for Theoretical Physics, in which we systematically explore effects vital for disk galaxy evolution - radial migration, substructure bombardment and gas accretion. These processes have always only been explored mostly in isolation from each other, and their combined effects on the evolution of a galactic disk are unknown. We will use proven state-of-the-art N-body \ hydrodynamics methods to explore for the first time the interdependence of these processes. The goals of the project are: to fully characterize disk evolution in the combined presence of disk dynamics and substructure bombardment; to produce observational tests relevant to the Gaia mission of different galactic evolutionary histories; to generate observational predictions of stellar diffusion, in order to provide a direct test of radial mixing in the Galaxy; to understand how cosmological gas-fueling influences disk growth. Beyond the scientific goals, the project aims to facilitate the researcher's return to Europe after a decade abroad. He will be involved in one of the largest research centers of its type, and given ample opportunity for collaboration with institutes across the EU, as well as teaching and technological training. The researcher will bring to the project his expertise in studying disk galaxy processes as well as current strong collaborative ties with U.S. institutions, thereby further solidifying the international cooperation between the U.S. and the EU in astrophysics research.",0,0
539,30980,No,Safe Passage and Navigation,"The SPAN project has achieved all the objectives. It provides a sound basis for planning safe passage at high speed in shallow water and a real time aid for navigation for fast twin hulled vessels. Software tools have been developed to optimise waterjet design, based upon new proven data, providing great improvements in shallow water. A computer model has been developed through which operational limits in shallow water could be realistically examined to ensure safe passage. An onboard model-based predictive system for collision/grounding avoidance in shallow waters has also been developed, to maintain 'safe navigation.'  A new more efficient and low wash hullform has been developed. An ultra low wash hullform has also been designed for use when wash is the very most important factor.  A new design for waterjets will result in lower weights of the craft and improved manoeuvrability. The excellent CFD results in comparision with the full scale trials have provided the consortium with a strong tool to further optimise the inlets for shallow water effects.  The navigational aid developed under the SPAN project exceeds the original objectives of the project proposal. As far as the consortium is aware there is nothing remotely as sophisticated available outside the military aerospace industry. Objectives and content   The market for fast ferries in deep water is well established. SPAN will extend this market by developing fast passenger ferries capable of operating in restricted and shallow waterways. In areas of high population density surrounding estuarine or wide river systems fast ferries provide an alternative to road transport giving economic and environmental benefits, by giving people better access to work and reducing road traffic congestion with associated fume emissions. For example, the Transtejo ferry service run in Portugal has a carrying capacity of 100,000 to 150,000 commuters per day. Much of the passage running is in shallow waters where excessive wash is also a problem.   It is known that vessel performance in shallow waters is different to that in deep water. Single hull vessel characteristics have been well researched but verified reliable data has not been developed to a sufficient extent for twin hulled water jet propelled ferries which now offer superior performance. Therefore, increased use of high speed twin hulled vessels in these conditions is handicapped by the absence of independent verified hydrodynamic data to predict their behaviour, particularly in shallow waters.  Once this data becomes available, enhanced controls can be developed to provide safe manoeuvring in busy waterways.  Without unreasonably impeding the use of this beneficial form of transport, Regulatory Authorities have a serious problem in interpreting IMO Code of Practice for High Speed Craft, in the absence of sound data upon which to base their licensing decisions.   The objective of SPAN is to provide a sound-basis for planning the safe passage at high speed in shallow water and to provide a real time aid for navigation for fast twin hulled vessels by :  - Providing software tools to optimize design, based upon new proven data, enabling shallow water jet performance to be within 48% of deep water, compared with the present 10-20%.  - Creating a computer model by which operational limits in shallow water can be realistically examined to ensure 'safe passage.'  - Building an on board model-based predictive system for collision/grounding avoidance in shallow waters, to maintain 'safe navigation.'   SPAN will provide safe passage for ferries in the range of 150 - 180 tonnes laden displacement carrying 350 - 500 passengers running at 25-30 knots in only 2 - 5m of water at drafts of 1.2 - 1.5m, restricting wash to 30 cm. To achieve these results, the work will develop 5 main sets of deliverables in the following areas :   - hull design, including CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modelling, water tank testing and sea trials.  - water jet design, taking into account the effects of water intake interaction with the hull  - an intelligent software system encoding the results of the modelling in the form of guidelines on safe operating criteria, implemented using a combination of Al and conventional techniques. Particular attention will be given to 'squat' behaviour, the effects of wave action and safe manoeuvrability - wash limits, environmental and safety considerations on permissible wash height.  - aids to navigation which will integrate the safe operating criteria with conventional navigational instruments (e.g. radar) to provide a pilot advisor.  SPAN is an end-user driven project. The demand for the results of the project comes from Transtejo Transportes Tejo (PT), which operates a ferry service across the Tagus river in Lisbon. The industrial partners seeking to meet these needs are FBM Marine (GB) a shipbuilder which already designs and builds high-speed, twin hulled passenger ferries, and LIPS (NL) which manufactures marine propulsion and control systems. These industrial companies are assisted in the project by British Maritime Technology (GB) with extensive experience of physical hydrodynamic modelling, and of adding intelligence to industrial software, the Unit for Marine Technology and Engineering of the Instituto Superior Tecnico (PT) in Lisbon and CETENA (IT) which is a subsidiary of Fincantieri, Italy's principal shipbuilder, and which is principally interested in developing three dimensional CFD techniques needed for SPAN.",1,0
778,215132,No,Metabolic engineering of Ustilago trichophora: an isotope-assisted metabolomics approach for the improvement of malate production from glycerol,"Biodiesel production is usually accompanied by the production of 10% (w/v) glycerol as main low-value by-product, making it not yet economically competitive to petroleum-based processes. Recently, Ustilaginaceae fungi have attracted more attention due to their abilities of using crude glycerol to produce chemicals of industrial interest. Unlike established filamentous fungi, many Ustilaginaceae strains can grow in haploid and unicellular form, which are remarkably advantageous for industrial applications. Of note, U. trichophora was reported to have the highest titre for microbial malate production, even if the yield is still low. If the carbon lost during cultivation is suppressed, U. trichophora will be a novel candidate for industrial malate production and contribute directly to crude glycerol valorisation. However, the metabolic network and its function are not described for any Ustilaginaceae species. Isotope-assisted metabolomics approaches are powerful in exploring the metabolic network operation. By capturing the snapshot or the kinetics of metabolite pools, these approaches can guide metabolic engineering strategies to alter metabolic flux distribution and maximize target compound production. Therefore, this study aims to decipher the structure and dynamics of the metabolic networks of U. trichophora by using isotope-assisted metabolomics approaches. Results obtained in this research will guide ongoing efforts in metabolic engineering to maximize malate production from crude glycerol of U. trichophora. Further contributions will be made beyond the envisaged industrial applications, as the Ustilaginaceae are also investigated in the context of host-pathogen interactions and fundamental cell biology.",0,0
1217,98962,No,Novel smart materials for biomedical application,"Over the last decade, considerable progress has been achieved in the treatment of both traumatic skin injury, such as severe burns, or the treatment of chronic soft tissue injury, such as chronic ulcers, by the use of tissue engineering scaffolds within which either natural, or stem cell based tissue regeneration can take place. One of the problems of using scaffolds in hospital is bacterial infection, which tends to start at a focal point, and spread across the wound bed and by the time this is obvious enough to see, the infection is well-progressed and difficult to eradicate with either antibiotics, or silver or iodine dressings. This proposal seeks to develop a novel material, smart cryogels, capable of responding to specific “signalling molecules” released either by bacteria or as a product of the immune response; to be used as wound dressings, and as tissue engineering scaffolds. The strategy proposed in the proposal is to secure the antimicrobial agent inside the polymer matrix controlling its release until it is needed. This allows targeting of the areas affected by infection, with antimicrobial agents, thus performing micro-point treatment. The fast specific response also allows release of the antimicrobial agent at the first sign of bacterial colonisation, providing earlier treatment, preventing infection and bacterial spreading, thus providing better treatment. The ability to treat infection at an earlier stage will significantly improve the healing process, providing better treatment and reduction of cost. The potential benefits of the project are very high, as the novel smart macroporous materials which will be developed have clear clinical and commercial potential as delivery materials for diverse applications in medicine, such as biomaterials, sensing/diagnosis devises and drug delivery systems.",0,0
530,83789,No,Aggressive competition in nematodes,"Competing males may sometimes, but only sometimes, fight to the death. This extreme behaviour, rare among animal species, has recently been seen in a nematode. We propose, for the first time, to study male-male aggression, including lethal combat, in nematodes. The aims are to (1) document the conditions under which competition between males of the insect parasitic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae escalates to killing, and (2) confirm that homosexual copulation noted in Caenorhabditis elegans represents sexually selected aggression.  In Steinernema, we will test the hypotheses that males can detect the size and sex ratio of the local population and adjust their fighting decisions appropriately, and that male size and residency determine the outcome of conflicts. Experiments will be done in drops of insect blood, where the number and identity of worms can be precisely manipulated. Findings will be confirmed in vivo in insect hosts. Even though lethal combat is not reported in C. elegans, longevity is reduced in all-male groups, and males deposit copulatory plugs on each other. We will test whether the fitness of 'plugged' (victim) males is reduced relative to that of 'pluggers', which would support our hypothesis that homosexual copulation represents sexually selected aggression in this species. Steinernema spp. are important biological insecticides, produced in Europe and traded globally.  Understanding their reproductive behaviour will improve their mass production, but the project has much wider importance. Nematodes including C. elegans represent a simple system in which to explore the evolutionary significance of male aggression, while laying a foundation for future physiochemical and genetic analysis. The experience the Fellow will gain in behavioural ecology will complement his existing expertise in applied nematology and provide him with the intellectual and leadership skills to head a team researching fundamental and applied invertebrate biology.",0,0
898,214241,No,The industrialization and market entry of a novel bioengineered hydrogel grid to standardize stem cell cultures for precision medicine.,"The ability to generate miniature organ models in a dish, termed organoids, from patient stem cells has opened endless possibilities for applications in precision medicine. SUN bioscience SA, a spin-off company of EPFL in Switzerland, was founded in 2016 with the ambition to move these organoid cultures from basic research to the Health Care industry.   To reach this goal, SUN bioscience has developed Gri3D, a microstructured biocompatible hydrogel platform, and aims to establish this technology as a new standard for growing organoids at industrial scale and precision. Gri3D prototypes have been field tested with over 30 European academic and pharmaceutical R&D groups. In addition, SUN bioscience has developed an industrial automated manufacturing mechanism for Gri3D that is now being translated into the world-wide first machine, Hydra I, that auomates liquid handling with hydrogel microembossing.  The objective of this feasibility study is to verify the technical, economical and practical viability of Gri3D and to ensure its successful market entry in Europe. Specifically, the first step is to validate the production capacity of Hydra I by producing 1’000 Gri3D units, which corresponds to one tenth of the total annual target production volume. In a second step, SUN bioscience aims to validate the market by commercializing these 1’000 Gri3D units to existing customers and to expand its customer base to a total of 20-40 recurrent clients.  According to our current strategy, SUN bioscience will run at maximum single line production capacity with cumulative revenues of >€2M within 3 years after market introduction of Gri3D. The 3D technologies market is expected to reach €600M by 2021. The long-term business objective is to implement organoid assays on Gri3D and to establish SUN bioscience as a leader in clinical diagnostics with the intention to initiate a phase 2 SME instrument project along this path.",0,0
541,88971,No,Emergent Connectors for Eternal Software Intensive Networked Systems,"The CONNECT Integrated Project aims at enabling continuous composition of networked systems to respond to the evolution of functionalities provided to and required from the networked environment. At present the efficacy of integrating and composing networked systems depends on the level of interoperability of the systems&apos; underlying technologies. However, interoperable middleware cannot cover the ever growing heterogeneity dimensions of the networked environment. CONNECT aims at dropping the interoperability barrier by adopting a revolutionary approach to the seamless networking of digital systems, that is, synthesizing on the fly the connectors via which networked systems communicate.  The resulting emergent connectors are effectively synthesized according to the behavioral semantics of application- down to middleware-layer protocols run by the interacting parties. The synthesis process is based on a formal foundation for connectors, which allows learning, reasoning about and adapting  the interaction behavior of networked systems at run-time. Synthesized connectors are concrete emergent system entities that are dependable, unobtrusive, and evolvable, while not compromising the quality of software applications.  To reach these objectives the CONNECT  project undertakes interdisciplinary research in the areas of behavior learning, formal methods, semantic services, software engineering, dependability, and middleware.  Specifically, CONNECT will investigate the following issues and related challenges: (i) Modeling and reasoning about peer system functionalities,  (ii) Modeling and reasoning about connector behaviors, (iii) Runtime synthesis of connectors, (iv) Learning connector behaviors,(v) Dependability assurance, and (vi) System architecture. The effectiveness of  CONNECT  research will be assessed by experimenting in the field of wide area, highly heterogeneous systems where today&apos;s solutions to interoperability already fall short (e.g., systems of systems of systems).",0,0
234,37092,Yes,Water pinch : simultaneous energy and water use minimisation,"Objectives   The objective of the project is to develop new design methods, supported by software, for combined energy and water management. The purpose is to minimise energy consumption, fresh water use, wastewater generation whilst minimising the cost of disposal of any waste generated. Both continuous and batch/semicontinuous processes are addressed. This novel concept for combined minimisation of energy and water consumption will also be extended for use in the Pulp and Paper Industry. Where the objective is to decrease energy consumption by a minimum of 20%.  The semicontinuous and batch processes targeted for the food and drink industries also offer the potential for significant reductions of about 40% in water and 60% in energy consumption.   Technical Approach   Pinch analysis is well established for studying heat recovery in the process industries. This method has now been extended to the problem of water and wastewater minimisation. Water use can be minimised by re-use, or by regeneration, followed by either re-use or recycling. The methodology first sets concentration limits for contaminants for each water-using operation. Knowing the flow rate of water to each operation allows a concentration composite curve to be plotted. Matching a water supply line against the concentration composite curve allows the target for maximum water re-use to be set. Design methods allow the targets for minimum water use to be set. Many uses of water in the process industries require the water to be heated. Water re-use enables direct heat recovery. This requires simultaneous consideration of both the level of contamination and temperature. The recovery of heat can be direct by re-use or indirect using heat exchangers. To analyse this problem the two methodologies for energy and water minimisation must be merged into a new one.   Expected Achievements and Exploitation   New methods for combined minimisation of energy and water consumption based on this novel concept will be available for use in industry. Energy will be saved and possible surplus energy used to reduce the use of fresh water by purifying and recycling process wastewaters. Up to 100% recycling is a real possibility.  The Pulp and Paper Plant of the future will require full wastewater recirculation. In order to achieve this, the energy consumption of the plant may increase. Consequently, economic viability will depend upon major energy efficiency improvements. Semicontinuous and batch processes (e.g. speciality chemicals, brewing and food processing) are characterised by a variety of reaction steps, solvents, or separation methods for the recovery and purification of the products. As a result, a variety of aqueous effluents are created. Any systematic effort must therefore be concentrated on a realistic water management scheme based on economic appraisal of different options, and a processing optimisation scheme guided by minimum pollution. The food and drink industry offers great potential for exploitation of the technology.",1,1

Despite this, the STARGRID Consortium will provide a view independent from interest of those stakeholders (utilities, large manufacturers,...) participating in the standardisation committees or coordination groups. STARGRID will incorporate the view and opinion of the industry about the smart grid standards, extending the scope beyond the EU 'Smart Grid Mandate' M490.Many experts are convinced that the main obstacle for turning the Smart Grid into reality will not be the lack of applicable and mature standards but the adoption and implementation across the broad range of technologies concerned.

In preparation of this ERANET Coordination Action (CA), the Netherlands Organisation for Health Re-search and Development (ZonMw) conducted an inventory of research programmes on priority medi-cines themes in Europe sponsored by the EC (SSA Priority Medicines 003214). The inventory identi-fied research on medicines for children as a most promising sub-area of priority medicines to focus towards. The CA will network and coordinate programme managers of national programmes to pool resources towards a common European goal and launch a joint European research programme on medicines for children (WP6). The consortium consists of key players in 9 European countries bringing together the national research councils, ministries and drug regulatory bodies/authorities which have the authority and the means to highlight research activities on the national agenda and to foster the implementation of the results of that research. By collaborating with relevant stakeholders, it develops a common research agenda on new, more effective and safer medicines for children.

909,192032,No,Modeling Disease through Cell Reprogramming: a Translational Approach to the Pathogenesis of Syndromes Caused by Symmetrical Gene Dosage Imbalances,"The fundamental limitation in our ability to dissect human diseases is the scarce availability of human tissues at relevant disease stages, which is particularly salient for neural disorders. Somatic cell reprogramming is overcoming this limitation through the derivation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can be differentiated into disease-relevant cell-types. Despite these tantalizing possibilities, there are critical issues to be addressed in order to secure iPSC-modeling as a robust platform for the interrogation of disease aetiology and the development of new therapies. These concern the taming of human genetic variation, the identification of differentiation stages in which to uncover and validate phenotypes, and finally their translational into drug discovery assays. This project confronts these challenges focusing on the paradigmatic case of two rare but uniquely informative disorders caused by symmetric gene dosage imbalances at 7q11.23: Williams Beuren Syndrome and the subset of autism spectrum disorders associated to 7q11.23 microduplication. The hallmark of WBS is a unique behavioral-cognitive profile characterized by hypersociability and intellectual disability in the face of comparatively well-preserved language abilities. Hence, the striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between WBS and 7dupASD points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage-sensitive genes affecting social behaviour and cognition. We build on a large panel of iPSC lines that we already reprogrammed from a unique cohort of WBS and 7dupASD patients and whose characterization points to specific derangements at the level of transcriptional/epigenetic control, protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction. Through the integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with targeted mass spectrometry and gene network prediction we propose an innovative drug discovery pipeline for the identification of new therapeutic leads.",0,0
1144,69545,No,Development of environmentally friendly tracer technology for improved reservoir description (ENVITRACER),"Objectives and problems to be solved: Tracers are chemical compounds used in tracer technology programmes aimed at hydrocarbon reservoir characterisation and efficient oil recovery. Currently used non-radioactive gas tracers, such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) are ozone depleting substances (CFCs) or have high Global Warming Potential (GWP) and extremely long lifetimes in the atmosphere (PFCs, SF6), constituting them very potent greenhouse gases (GHG). Regarding water tracers, Fluoro-Benzoic Acids (FBAs) bio-accumulate in the seawater posing a threat to the ocean environment.  given (i) the current pressure of the environmental authorities on the oil industry to reduce and even ban the use of such chemicals and (ii) their proven usefulness in the oil exploration and production operations, the project aspires to enlarge the portfolio of environmentally acceptable gas and water tracers thus, ensuring the routine application of a cost-effective method like tracers in reservoir operations. This means that the project aims to identify chemical compounds satisfying both the requirements of being stable in the reservoir over a long time period and at the same time being degradable to avoid bioaccumulation or irreversible accumulation in the atmosphere.  Therefore, ENVITRACER objectives include: - Develop and test new, non-radioactive, water and gas tracers that satisfy the current requirements of the oil industry while reducing substantially the aforementioned harmful environmental effects. - Assess the cost-effectiveness of the new tracers (production and field application) and propose recommendations and guidelines for the industrial practice on this issue. Description of the work : To ensure the smooth execution of the project the following main targets have to be achieved: - Identification of chemical compounds with a potential to qualify as gas or water tracers - Studying the behaviour of the compounds in the laboratory at reservoir conditions to ensure thermal, chemical and microbial stability - Evaluation of the environmental friendliness of the compounds - Reduction of the costs of tracer production and of the respective detection limits for field application - Development of an advanced tracer flow electronic laboratory - Evaluation of the flow behaviour of the tracers - Testing the selected compounds in the oil field - Evaluation of the results, cost effectiveness of the new tracers, integration into recommendations and guidelines for industrial practice - Effective exploitation and dissemination to selected target groups. Expected results and Exploitation Plans: - Establishment of new methodologies on the synthesis and detection of the new tracers. -Development of a numerical simulation tool that will take into account the dependency of the distribution of tracers in a reservoir on appropriate physico-chemical properties and process parameters and will assess the behaviour of tracers thus replacing effectively currently applied costly experiments - Development and testing of new, non-radioactive water and gas reservoir tracers that are friendly towards the environment - Recommendations for guidelines to the oil industry regarding the use of the newly developed water and gas tracer technology. Several aspects of the proposal take on an innovative character (developing and testing new, cost-effective tracers, proposing guidelines for the oil industry). While during the development of the previous generation of tracers their environmental impact was not given sufficient attention, the 'environmental inertness' becomes now on a prerequisite for the selection of the new generation of water and gas tracers. In addition, some of the expected results on the new tracers are generic in nature and have important applications in other sectors that use these compounds and should reduce their emissions soon (e.g. heat exchangers, pollution in rivers and ground water systems, mixing and homogenisation apparatuses). This aspect makes the project of multi-sectorial importance and shows how its results and the associated benefits may diffuse to other industrial sectors.",1,0
1275,98756,No,Sub-seabed CO2 Storage: Impact on Marine Ecosystems (ECO2),"The ECO2 project sets out to assess the risks associated with the storage of CO2 below the seabed. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is regarded as a key technology for the reduction of CO2 emissions from power plants and other sources at the European and international level. The EU will hence support a selected portfolio of demonstration projects to promote, at industrial scale, the implementation of CCS in Europe. Several of these projects aim to store CO2 below the seabed. However, little is known about the short-term and long-term impacts of CO2 storage on marine ecosystems even though CO2 has been stored sub-seabed in the North Sea (Sleipner) for over 13 years and for one year in the Barents Sea (Snøhvit). Against this background, the proposed ECO2 project will assess the likelihood of leakage and impact of leakage on marine ecosystems. In order to do so ECO2 will study a sub-seabed storage site in operation since 1996 (Sleipner, 90 m water depth), a recently opened site (Snøhvit, 2008, 330 m water depth), and a potential storage site located in the Polish sector of the Baltic Sea (B3 field site, 80 m water depth) covering the major geological settings to be used for the storage of CO2. Novel monitoring techniques will be applied to detect and quantify the fluxes of formation fluids, natural gas, and CO2 from storage sites and to develop appropriate and effective monitoring strategies. Field work at storage sites will be supported by modelling and laboratory experiments and complemented by process and monitoring studies at natural CO2 seeps that serve as analogues for potential CO2 leaks at storage sites. ECO2 will also investigate the perception of marine CCS in the public and develop effective means to disseminate the project results to stakeholders and policymakers. Finally, a best practice guide for the management of sub-seabed CO2 storage sites will be developed applying the precautionary principle and valuing the costs for monitoring and remediation.",1,0
48,60475,Yes,"Development of a Continue, Intelligent, Autonomous, Real Time Monitoring the Alarming System for Radon Detection in Ground-Water","Scientific objectives and approach:  The implementation of this project will have far reaching environmental implications for different region. At present no measures have been applied whatsoever to deal with the threat to water quality. The project can therefore be expected to provide a significant improvement on the current situation. The problem of water quality is present throughout the region, as a result of a combination of geological factors. There is a clear need to take immediate measures, to evaluate the scale of the problem, to establish monitoring in relevant sites, and to introduce measures which will lead to an improvement in water quality. It aids the implementation of the first European standardization water policy, which focuses on the maximum allowed quantities of radon authorized in drinking and environmental water. It is clear that there are some technical risks, but the partnership will take all the protections for a successful. A significant part of the project proposal is the development of a continuous real-time monitoring station which is able to detect with a high degree of accuracy even a very low radon concentration in water. The development of this station requires a structured approach by establishing the appropriate design parameters for prototype instrumentation, involving all participants in clearly defining operational requirements, engineering framework, consolidating research, prototype development and laboratory testing of all the key modules. The resulted engineering specification would allow rapid transfer of this technology into manufacture in addition to the determination of operational specifications, thus allowing a complete appraisal of the market potential. The target levels will be selected for the further remedial actions based on the relevant ecological conditions and human health to be protected. Again, suggestions will be made on feasible remedial actions to remove water contamination or to reduce the risks.  Problems to be solved:  In homes, buildings, drinking water and ground water, in some areas of the world, radon produced by the radioactive decay of uranium-238, present in soil, in rock and in groundwater can reach levels regarded as dangerous. To date, only Standard Method 7500-Rn (liquid scintillation counting) and the Lucas Cell methods have adequate inter-laboratory data for evaluation. It's take too long time for water analyses (3 to 4 days and 100  sample for lab analysis). For this reason the core of SME's has take a challenge for the development and construction of the first ever, real time, automated continuous monitoring radon in water and alarming system under computer supervision. It has to be strongly emphasized that the quality of life of the population depends on the quality of water which they use and reuse. The target of the project is to provide a sustainable radon contamination risk assessment and management tool. At the same time it will provide an effective qualitative and quantitative ground water monitoring.  Expected Impacts:  The proposers as well as other potential partners envisage a successful product which can be eventually manufactured and become commercially available. Due to the non existence of this kind of apparatus, it appears an opportunity for the SME core to access the international market. Further this project will develop new type of environmental services (environmental contaminant control system) which can be offered by the partners. The possible clients include water companies, companies undertaking remediation and environmental monitoring, environmental and health agencies and local authorities. The use of the strategy developed in this project, as input to a decision support system, can provide economic benefits, when, for example, extreme events such as a high concentration of radon in a thermal station is monitored.",1,1
271,34440,Yes,CONSTRAINT LOGIC FOR OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF WATER SYSTEMS,"The management and operational control of water systems, from drinking-water distribution to the control of industrial waste water, is a complex problem, which is mostly site- and time-specific. Traditional methods experience difficulties dealing with these problems, due to the diversity of constraints imposed (physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, public management etc.). Typically, there is a lack of complete data. As a consequence, the need for new decision-making tools coping with these complex problems is great. These tools should be flexible, easily adaptable to specific user needs and able to present fast solutions in situations where there is incomplete and imprecise knowledge.  This project concerned Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), a newly emerging programming tool. Recently, CLP was successfully applied in PlaNets, which deals with operational problems in electric power-distribution networks. The similarity between power-distribution network and a water-distribution network was evident. The success of PlaNets proved that transferring this innovative technology of constraint modelling, to water-system management, offers great benefit. The success of PlaNets application lies in tight integration of constraints factors such as time, topology and electricity, yielding global solutions to a complex problem. Moreover, it proved that constraint-based computing can deal with imprecise knowledge and partial information in an efficient way.  The project was an interesting example of sector to sector transfer of technology. Some of the strong elements of the project includedL - CLP software and hardware had been purchased and accepted by the end user and 3 end user engineers have been trained by the project. - through dissemination new opportunities arose; for example contacts were initiated with various water utilities (e.g. KIWA - the association for Dutch drinking water companies) in Europe for a continuation of the project on a market-orientated basis.",0,1
1039,73899,No,Estimation of willingness-to-pay to reduce risks of exposure to heavy metals and cost-benefit analysis for reducing heavy metals occurence in Europe,"Heavy metals from different sources accumulate in the environment. From a policy point of view, it has-been difficult to tackle the environmental problems due to heavy metals partly because the problem has been viewed from different policy domains (air, water, soils etc.). Thus, it is not guaranteed that the policy mix applied under environmental regulation is optimal. A systems analysis would be required to define the sources of heavy metals, how they are dispersed in the environment and which adverse effects they might cause on human and ecosystems health. From a policy point of view, it is also important to identify what kinds of policy responses would be most cost-effective to reduce the impacts of heavy metals. Such information is required for carrying out cost-benefit analyses of reducing the occurrence of heavy metals in our society. Identifying the benefits would include a monetary valuation of the impacts with contingent valuation (CV) approaches (e.g. assessing the willingness-to-pay,WTP). The focus of the work described will be on priority metals, which are mercury, cadmium, chrome, nickel, arsenic and lead. Core aim of the research is to to carry out cost-effectiveness (CEA)and cost-benefit analyses (CBA) for reducing the heavy metals occurrence, in the EU Member States and candidate countries, including damage assessment to the environment and human health in the long term following the impact pathway analysis which assesses the impacts and damages of pollutants from their emissions over their dispersion to exposure and impacts. Finally, feasibility study will be conducted to identify the potentials, strengths and weaknesses and uncertainties of currently available macro-economic models to identify further research needs in this field.",0,0
1022,96029,No,Orbital Free Density Functional Theory: insights from quantum chemistry and atomic physics,"This proposal aims to put me at the forefront of research in two related domains: quantum chemistry and atomic physics. These domains have the same origin in finding solutions to the Schrödinger equation. Although the methods in both domains stem from the same ab initio approach, they departed from their common ground and developed methods specific to their problems. A few decades ago a revolutionary method came to quantum chemistry: Density Functional Theory (DFT). In this theory the electronic density function replaces the traditional, more complicated wave function to describe the electronic structure of molecules. The implications for computational chemistry have been astounding. The successful development of density functionals to evaluate a system&apos;s energy, has made DFT a powerful tool, with applications from bio-chemistry to chemical reactivity. It has become the most popular quantum chemical tool. Today&apos;s calculations typically use the Kohn-Sham method which implies the introduction of orbitals, departing from the original spirit of the density-only theory. Motivated by their computational attractiveness (linear scaling, no orthonormalization,no Brillouin zone sampling) researchers have taken up the challenge to design orbital free functionals. This project aims towards the construction and evaluation of such orbital free functionals. Since DFT approaches, remarkably, never found their way to atomic physics, where their potential is evident and since ab initio methods from atomic physics still provide the highest quality density functions (corresponding to an eigenstate), the objectives in this project propose a synergy of concepts, methods and fundamental aspects in both fields. For the successful execution of this interdisciplinary proposal, milestones have been identified which, with the appropriate training, based on the experience and knowledge on functional development of Professor Tozer, is expected to lead to high quality publications.",0,0
134,216764,Yes,"Development and commercialisation of cost effective, easy to use, fit and maintain domestic greywater reuse system","Globally, water is an increasingly scarce resource. Increased demand, combined with poor and leaking infrastructure has increased pressure on existing supply. The situation is expected to get worse, with water consumption by the public, industry and agriculture is anticipated to rise by ~16 % over the next 15 years. In the absence of further actions to those already planned by water companies to balance supply and demand, under a high population and high climate change scenario, UK water supply deficits are projected to become more widespread by the 2050s. In particular: • The north west of England and the Yorkshire and Humber region are projected to be highly susceptible to supply-demand deficits, as well as London and the south-east. However, deficits are projected in other parts of the UK as well, including areas of south Wales and the central belt of Scotland. • At a national scale, England, Scotland and Wales are projected to be in deficit by 800 million to 3 billion litres per day by 2050 (5–16% of total demand) and by 1.4 billion to 5 billion litres per day by 2080 (8-29% of the total demand).  Solutions are needed to alleviate these problems and efficient use of resources is a key strategy. With an increasing drive to reduce water consumption, it is desirable to reuse water rather than ration it through low- flow showers and low- flush toilets that don’t meet public expectation when water consumption can be reduced in larger quantities by recycling shower and bath water instead.  In response to recurring water shortages and ensuing legislations for sustainability we are developing an integrated ‘hard’ waste water recycling system ‘Aqua-Gratis’. Our technology is based on collecting grey water from showers and baths in a house, treating the water with a suitable biocide and then distributing to toilet cisterns for use as required which when fitted into urban domestic and commercial new builds.",1,1
1190,194990,No,Navigating and Innovating in Complex Healthcare Ecosystems,"Navigating and Innovating Connected Health Ecosystems (NICHE) How can technology firms beneficially influence healthcare provision? Technology is vital for future well-being given economic and demographic strain on healthcare systems but market innovation has proven difficult to implement.  Conventional marketing is based on linear diffusion models created for consumer or investment goods markets. In healthcare however, innovating firms face diverse stakeholders: healthcare practitioners, buyers, consumers, regulators, politicians, the media and the public at large. Innovation in such ecosystems requires interactive and iterative processes of R&D, market sensing, networking, coalition building, and deep understanding of healthcare and regulatory practices. This project will assist healthtech companies to navigate, influence and gain traction for their innovations in complex healthcare ecosystems by designing and testing a healthcare market engagement roadmap:  1) A user-centric assessment tool to identify stakeholders, stakeholder practices and incumbent technologies with which an innovative health technology interacts 2) A strategic engagement model for complex ecosystems 3) A competency framework for ecosystem-shaping skills. A multimethod approach combines ethnography, social network analysis and organizational action research. Training will be sought in healthtech development and commercialization through UC Berkeley’s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), in sociology of healthcare and innovation through UC Berkeley’s Center for Science, Technology, Medicine and Society (CSTMS) and secondment at the Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation, Ecole des Mines ParisTech (CSI), in social network analysis through UCD’s Insight Centre for Data Analytics, in policy/regulatory interactions at UCD’s Applied Research for Connected Health Technology Centre (ARCH) and in research translation on secondment at multinational company, S3.",0,0
257,210695,Yes,THE INDICATOR FOR SOLAR WATER DISINFECTION,"Even though water is a fundamental resource for human-beings, millions of people around the world lack an access to safe drinking water as they can hardly afford/ have access to current water disinfection methods, such as filtration, boiling, chlorination or ultra violet radiation.  Amongst all available water disinfection techniques, solar water disinfection (SODIS) is a known method, acknowledged by several entities such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization as a cheap and effective way for communities to treat their water and eliminate microbial pathogens. However, it is not easy to correctly estimate the time needed for the sun to disinfect the contaminated water, as the duration of the process depends on the UV-radiation received, which depends on different parameters of the “environment”, e.g. weather, altitude, etc. At Helioz we identified the potential of SODIS in 2010, and ever since 2013 we have been devoted to the development of WADI, a solar-powered UV-measurement device which, by simply placing it next to the PET-bottles containing contaminated water, will tell the user the exact state of disinfection, acting as a precise indicator for SODIS. In this way, using WADI in combination with SODIS to fight against waterborne diseases will allow an easy access to disinfected drinking water: as confirmed by the WHO, it meets microbiological performance criteria for household water treatment technologies and is classified as providing targeted protection. With this project we aim to fully develop and commercialize our solution, and turn it into a real competing product that will dramatically decrease cost of clean and disinfected water in BoP countries, transforming users from donation recipients into educated customers. Moreover, it will also enable the growth of our company, as we expect to reach revenues of €12 million in the first 3 years of commercialization.",1,1
214,82810,Yes,Investigation of the effects of Thermal Stratification on Hydrodynamics of a Reservoir,"Understanding the lake hydrodynamics is important for the management of water resources and thermal stratification is of great importance for the pattern of mixing in lakes and reservoirs. This study will investigate the structure of the thermal stratification, its relation to wind and flow conditions, and its effects on vertical velocity profiles, suspended sediment concentrations and water quality parameters.  In lakes and reservoirs, the effects of thermal stratification on velocity profiles and subsequently on water quality parameters are not completely understood. At the end of this study, simple relationships between stratification and velocity profiles, stratification and suspended sediment concentrations, stratification and water quality parameters w ill be established. The numerical model that will be applied to the reservoir is a 3-D hydrodynamic model necessary for simulating both the horizontal circulation in the reservoir due to wind effect and inflows/outflows and vertical circulation in the water column required for assessing the effects of stratification.  Existing studies on the topic lack extensive field measurements required for validation of numerical models applied to the water systems. The proposed study will deliver simple relationships based on numerical modelling validated by field measurements filling this gap.  Climate change is among one of the three main priorities of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme. In this study, the researcher will use a comprehensive numerical model validated by a series of field measurements to model hydrodynamics in a reservoir. Then, the possible scenarios of climate change will be determined by the application of widely accepted climate models. Investigation of the sensitivity of water quality parameters to the changes in temperature as anticipated by the existing climate change models will guide policy makers for the sustainable management of water resources in the future.",0,1
730,201419,No,Cyanobacteria for restoration of degraded soils,"Frequent land degradation problems in drylands make necessary the adoption of effective and low cost restoration strategies for a sustainable development of these areas. However, water scarcity and low soil fertility inherent to drylands make difficult implementation of traditional restoration techniques based on plant cover establishment. Recent studies point to the viability of cyanobacteria and their secreted exopolysaccharides (EPS) as an eco-friendly biotechnology technique for restoration of arid degraded soils. However, cyanobacteria utilization is limited due to lack of knowledge regarding the factors involved in the success and failure of inoculated cyanobacteria. The general objective of Cyano4REST  is cover the gap in knowledge on the relationships between the characteristics of the polysaccharidic matrix produced by cyanobacteria in the soils and its role in affecting soil hydraulic properties, soil stability and CO2 fluxes in biocrusts. The specific objectives are: 1) Identification and culture of cyanobacteria species present in biocrusts from different arid and semiarid regions; 2) Chemical and macromolecular characterization of the EPS secreted by cyanobacteria species and their influence on biocrust development; 3) Analysis of the influence of cyanobacteria inoculation on soil properties and CO2 fluxes on different textured soils; 4) Cyanobacteria inoculation on soils under field conditions and analysis of their influence on soil fertility and stability, soil moisture, and CO2 fluxes. This project represent a significant step forward the development of successful strategy for soil restoration based on the artificial inoculation of cyanobacteria. Cyano4REST will thus increase the European research visibility in the development of new biotechnological techniques to promote sustainable development, ensure the protection of the environment and combat climate change, one of the priority areas of the H2020 program.",0,0
693,209500,No,Design and Engineering Next-Generation Nanopore Devices for Bioplymer Analysis,"Nanopores have emerged in the past few years as a promising analytical technique. The basic concept of nanopore sensing is to apply a potential across individual nanoscale pores and observe the disruption of the ionic flow caused by single molecules entering the pore. Ionic currents through protein pores have been successful at recognizing tiny differences in molecules in solution. Most notably, arrays of thousands of nanopores integrated in low-cost and portable devices are now capable of sequencing DNA at the single-molecule level. The main challenge of nanopore sensing is the inability of controlling the protein pore diameter and geometry, which determines the signal and enables selectivity based on physical size.  The aim of this proposal is to design a new generation of protein nanopores that will take on the next grand challenge in nanopore sensing, that is the sequence identification of single proteins.   In order to sequence proteins, the designed nanopores must: unfold a target protein, control the speed of its transit across the nanopore and recognize individual amino acids. Our approach is to design a transmembrane molecular machine that will unfold target proteins and feed the linearize polypeptide through the nanopore where single amino acids will be recognized by modulations of the nanopore current. The specific objectives are:  i) Develop chemical and biotechnological methods to design synthetic protein-based pores  ii) To precisely attach the unfolding machine to a nanopore iii) To genetically engineer the nanopore for optimal amino acid recognition  Our nanopore devices will be used to develop the first technology to sequence single proteins. Compared to the state of the art ‘shotgun proteomics’, the nanopore approach will allow long polypeptide reads, recognition of low-abundance proteins, including biomarkers linked to diseases, and real-time monitoring with minimal cost, time and sample preparation.",0,0

385,110230,No,A Sociology of the Transnational Constitution,"This project examines the societal pressures that shape the changing pattern of contemporary constitutionalism. In particular, it examines the rise of a transnational judicial constitution: that is, of a legal order, overarching national boundaries, in which, at different levels, judicial actors assume unprecedented authority to shape and conduct legislation. It is designed to produce the first macro-sociological explanation of the changing constitutional form of contemporary democracy, and it develops a unique sociological methodology for examining the rise of transnational norms and transnational judicial power.  The project advances the distinctive thesis, first, that transnational judicial constitutionalism needs to be examined as a functional extension of classical constitutionalism. Further, it advances the thesis that the rise of the transnational judicial constitution is shaped – to a high degree – by forces within particular national societies, and it brings solutions for political-systemic problems embedded in these societies. Notably, the construction of a transnational legal domain performs vital state-building functions for particular societies, it acts to raise the autonomy of state institutions, and in many cases it forms the structural precondition of effective statehood. By examining the inner-societal origins of the convergence between national and transnational legal domains, the project elaborates a model of contemporary constitutionalism that calls into question widespread globalist preconceptions regarding the origins of transnational norms, and it proposes a sociological counter-thesis to common analyses of legal globalization.  The project accomplishes its objectives by examining the impact of transnational legal norms on the structure of political institutions in eleven specifically selected polities: Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, Poland, Russia, Tunisia, USA, UK, and Venezuela.",0,0

The innovations of the project constitute a technology platform with a very wide field of potential applications. All components and systems have reached at least TRL4 and will be further developed reaching at least TRL7. The main focus of the project will be on the following applications: 1. A simplified ED system that can be used for brackish water desalination (8 pilots in developing countries) or for tap-water softening (2 pilots in Germany and the Netherlands). 2. A multistage ED system for industrial-scale seawater desalination, which will be demonstrated to reach energy consumption as low as 1.5 kWh/m3 (1 pilot in the Netherlands) 3. Combinations of the multistage ED system with the latest salinity gradient power systems (Reverse ElectroDialysis - RED), which can further reduce energy consumption for seawater desalination to the region of 1 kWh/m3 (1 pilot in the Netherlands) 4. The versatile nature of the developed innovations will be demonstrated by testing their combinations with Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems (1 pilot in Spain). This will allow initial market introduction, without the need to replace the extensive RO infrastructure. The pilot systems in developing countries will be located in critical areas where the project partner PHAESUN has local offices in Africa (Eritrea, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia), Asia (Dubai, and India) and Latin America (Panama).

1169,97367,No,Targeting the reproductive biology of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae: from laboratory studies to field applications,"Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are the major vectors of malaria, a disease with devastating consequences for human health. Novel methods for controlling the natural vector populations are urgently needed, given the evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and the lack of novel insecticidals. Understanding the processes at the bases of mosquito biology may help to roll back malaria. In this proposal, we will target mosquito reproduction, a major determinant of the An. gambiae vectorial capacity. This will be achieved at two levels: (i) fundamental research, to provide a deeper knowledge of the processes regulating reproduction in this species, and (ii) applied research, to identify novel targets and to develop innovative approaches for the control of natural populations. We will focus our analysis on three major players of mosquito reproduction: male accessory glands (MAGs), sperm, and spermatheca, in both laboratory and field settings. We will then translate this information into the identification of inhibitors of mosquito fertility. The experimental activities will be divided across three objectives. In Objective 1, we will unravel the role of the MAGs in shaping mosquito fertility and behaviour, by performing a combination of transcriptional and functional studies that will reveal the multifaceted activities of these tissues. In Objective 2 we will instead focus on the identification of the male and female factors responsible for sperm viability and function. Results obtained in both objectives will be validated in field mosquitoes. In Objective 3, we will perform screens aimed at the identification of inhibitors of mosquito reproductive success. This study will reveal as yet unknown molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive success in mosquitoes, considerably increasing our knowledge beyond the state-of-the-art and critically contributing with innovative tools and ideas to the fight against malaria.",0,0

It will proceed by the investigation of selected occurences for: -assessing the presence and type of radionuclides in the primary and wastes products, and their parameters -analysing and identi fying the pathways for dispersion of radionuclides (erosion, dust re-suspension, surface water, groundwater) in the neighbourhood of the wastes, and defining the impact of the wastes on the ecosystem. -assesing the impact on health of the population i n the plants and in the vicinity of the wastes from the presence of radionuclides (gas-emission, inhalation) -defining the risk from the use of by-products of the wastes (building material that contais fly ash, disposal in engineered surface impoundement s and landfills, industrial product based on waste material). Based on the results of these case studies, the project will: -examine the radiation protection management and the monitoring practice for the investigated test-sites, -it will develop recom mendations for each type of tailing dump in order to optimise the existing protection and remediation practice -it will promote the adoption of existing legislation and regulations in the",0,0
