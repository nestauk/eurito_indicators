383,31002,No,Metallurgical control of filiform corrosion of aluminium rolled products,"BE95-1142 Metallurgical Control of Filiform Corrosion of Aluminium Rolled Products  The future of the aluminium rolling industry in Europe depends on large volume production and sale of coil treated painted products. The present market is mainly for architectural applications which is under serious threat in coastal areas of Belgium and Holland due to filiform corrosion experienced in service. The future market is in automotive sheet that has enormous market potential both for body panels and for automotive structures. Prevention of corrosion of painted sheet in automotive applications is therefore of paramount importance particularly as this market is in its infancy and confidence in the usage of aluminium must be maintained. In particular, filiform and other forms of underfilm corrosion, must be prevented irrespective of the metal source (primary, remelt or recycled), the casting technique (direct chill, electromagnetic or continuous), the fabrication practice, the surface treatment technology and the alloy system. In addition, all processes used, especially in surface treatment, must be environmentally friendly and economically attractive. The use of recycled metal is an important issue as the automotive industry will soon be faced with an EC law which will demand that car manufacturers take back used cars and ensure subsequent recycling and similar legislative measures are under consideration for the building industry.  The key need is to understand how the metallurgy of the aluminium substrate as determined by metal source alloy composition, casting, processing and surface treatment controls filiform corrosion resistance. Once this understanding is achieved composition control and modified production practices will be developed and instigated to ensure that irrespective of metal source the inherent resistance to filiform corrosion of coated aluminium substrates as determined by the underlying metal is maximised.  Substrates of alloys for architectural and automotive applications will be provided and filiform corrosion tested by the industrial partners using primary, remelt and recycled metal. The experience of the industrial partners as major European aluminium companies will be combined with the proven research expertise of the two university based partners who have shown how advanced and unique electrochemical and electron metallographic techniques can be combined to determine the role of the aluminium substrate in filiform corrosion of coated aluminium products.  The consortium comprises a manufacturer of coated aluminium sheet (AlcanD) and a manufacturer of mill finished aluminium sheet (Hoog) from primary and remelt metal using direct chill casting and-electromagnetic casting respectively, end-users and manufacturers (Hydro and HunterD) who are interested in extensive use of both recycled and primary metal and the use of roll-casters. The industrial partners Hoog and Hydro have already established strong links with the universities TUDelft and NTH respectively.",0,0
775,94544,No,Facilitate IT-providing SMEs by Operation-related Models and Methods,"The FACIT SME project addresses SMEs operating in the ICT domain. The goals are (a) to facilitate the use of Software Engineering (SE) methods and to systematize their application integrated with the business processes, (b) to provide efficient and affordable certification of these processes according to internationally accepted standards, and (c) to securely share best practices, tools and experiences with development partners and customers. The project targets (1) to develop a novel Open Reference Model (ORM) for ICT SME, serving as knowledge backbone in terms of procedures, documents, tools and deployment methods; (2) to develop a customisable Open Source Enactment System (OSES) that provides IT support for the project-specific application of the ORM; and (3) to evaluate these developments with 5 ICT SMEs by establishing the ORM, the OSES and preparing the certifications. The approach combines and amends achievements from Model Generated Workplaces, Certification of SE for SMEs, and model-based document management. The consortium is shaped by 4 significant SME associations as well as a European association exclusively focused on the SME community in the ICT sector. Five R&amp;D partners provide the required competences. Five SMEs operating in the ICT domain will evaluate the results in daily-life application. The major impact is expected for ICT SMEs by (a) optimising their processes based on best practise; (b) achieving internationally accepted certification; and (c) provision of structured reference knowledge. They will improve implementation projects and make their solutions more appealing to SMEs. ICT SME communities (organized by associations) will experience significant benefit through exchange of recent knowledge and best practises. By providing clear assets (ORM and OSES), the associations shape the service offering to their members and strengthen their community. The use of Open Source will further facilitate the spread of the results across Europe.",0,0
791,81189,No,Age-dependent inflammatory responses after stroke,"Problem: Ageing is associated with alterations of gene activities modulating the inflammatory and immune response. Stroke is a common health problem in the European Community and the leading cause of severe long-term disability. Inflammatory reactions within the brain as well as a systemic immune response are assumed to influence the outcome after stroke.  Hypothesis: The extent and the progression of the immune response after stroke is altered in elderly patients. The age-dependent inflammatory reaction is a major determinant of the outcome after stroke.  Aims: The age-dependent inflammatory reaction in brain following stroke will be characterised by functional genomics and proteomics in the ARGES-project. Furthermore, systemic markers of the inflammator y response after stroke will be identified in circulating leukocytes, which will serve as clinical indicators for potential therapeutical interventions. In addition to the genome-wide approach, we will specifically analyse the functional impact of a pre-selected pathway, the sphingomyelin-ceramide-cycle, considered to be critically involved in stroke-induced destructive processes.  Significance: The project will substantially contribute to our understanding of the age-dependence of the inflammatory react ion following stroke, which has as yet not been sufficiently investigated. We expect that ARGES will deliver indicators for therapeutical interventions whose application may considerable improve the outcome after stroke. We thus will make a significant contribution to basic scientific knowledge, therapy and diagnostics of stroke.",0,0
131,226748,No,"Decolonising madness? Transcultural psychiatry, international order and the birth of a global psyche in the aftermath of the Second World War","This project will provide crucial insights into the debate on the universality and cross-cultural applications of the notions of mental health and illness by offering the first and inter-disciplinary account of the historical origins and development of the concept of ‘global psyche’ and transcultural psychiatry. It will offer the first historical analysis of the colonial and post-colonial roots of the current global mental health movement, and the first systematic account of the decolonisation of psychiatry and mental health sciences. It will argue that the concept of universal, global psyche emerged in the aftermath of WWII and during decolonisation, when Western psychiatry strove to leave behind its colonial legacies, and lay the foundation for a more inclusive conversation between Western and non-Western mental health communities. In this period, leading psychiatrists across the globe set about identifying and defining the universal psychological mechanisms supposedly shared among all cultures (and 'civilisations'). I will explore this far-reaching psychiatric, social and cultural search for a new definition of 'common humanity', which developed in an increasingly inter-connected and culturally diverse global context, and examine the historical forces that drove it. I will also examine how the profession negotiated the tensions between researching cultural particularities and developing new, cross-cultural models of the mind.  The project will answer some of the core questions related to this transformative period: How did psychiatrists and anthropologists from all over the world re-define the relationship between culture, race and individual psyche following the end of the Second World War and colonialism, what was the role of experts from the Global South and Eastern Europe in this transformative process, and did this new global and transcultural psychiatry succeed in departing from the erstwhile colonial frameworks?",0,0
464,70975,No,Emissions Characterisation and Inventories,"Specific Objectives:  To contribute to the development of new/amended Directives for motorcycles (WMTC) and non-road engines (NRTC). To anticipate future needs by performing research related to fuel types, fuel consumption and emissions in fields of future importance. To provide technical expertise for the implementation of Community Strategy on dioxins in Candidate Countries and for the planned 2004 review of the Large Combustion Plants Directive. To set up and use a facility for the measurement of pollutants from co- combustion of waste in household furnaces, fireplaces and heating systems. The facility will then be used for the characterisation of non-regulated industrial emissions by means of advanced techniques with the view of introducing new standards/limit values. To improve the compilation of emission inventories from mobile and stationary sources, with focus on the contribution of small combustion sources to the dioxin inventories in the EU and CC. To contribute to the improvement of the evaluation of the methodologies and the process of preparation of emission inventories in Member States and Candidate Countries. To act as training site for Member States, Candidate Countries, Balkan and Mediterranean States. To collect particulate matter data at an urban to regional scale through ad-hoc campaigns and measurement networks in order to determine the impact of sources on PM over Europe. The first measurement campaigns will be organised under controlled test conditions and in large metropolitan and background areas by means of mobile laboratories to chemically and physically characterise emissions from stationary and mobile sources.

Procedure for advanced chemical/physical fingerprinting of emission sources. A source apportionment approach through the Chemical Mass Balance Receptor Modelling and the use of chemical and isotopic markers (Progress Report). Summary of the Action:  The action investigates emissions in terms of their physical/chemical characteristics and their contribution to air pollution. The main objectives in 2003 are the assessment and harmonisation of emission measurements, the contribution to the development of new regulations, improvement of emission inventories and the development of new source apportionment methods. The available test facilities and the chemistry lab will be used for training of young scientists. Keeping in mind the cross- border character of emissions and the special conditions in the Candidate Countries (CC), activities on emissions from small sources and most vehicle emission activities will be carried out in cooperation with Candidate and Balkan Countries, the new neighbours of an enlarged European Union. Rationale Transport, energy and industry contribute to most major air pollutants. Research on short- and medium-term development of combustion propulsion technologies, fuels and the related emissions will support the Commission's work on new or amended Directives for vehicle emissions. Long-term objectives, like the life- cycle analysis for future fuels and technologies will support technology foresight in transportation. Harmonisation of the emission measurements, methods development and standards validation are open topics related to emissions characterisation of large as well as small stationary sources. Research will support the work on Directives for incinerators and large combustion plants. The characterisation of emissions from mobile and stationary sources will be completed by field studies: source apportionment and emission inventories identify the sources contributing to the emission burden.",1,0
588,196151,No,Structure of a large non-crystalline multiprotein assembly by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance with ultra-fast magic-angle spinning,"Extrapolating from protein structure to function is an operation difficult to accomplish, as most functions in the cell are not carried out by single proteins, but by macromolecular complexes containing multiple subunits endowed with specific functions. Despite the many advances in structural and biochemical studies of isolated molecules, a comprehensive portrait of cell biochemistry must thus include insights of the supramolecular network of interactions among the individual constituents. The structure determination of large and dynamical protein ensembles presents a great deal of challenges for X-ray diffraction techniques, and for solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) due to the large size of these objects. Consequently, there is little information available today on the overall organization of the assembly subunits, their interactions, and sometimes their precise function within the cell. High-resolution solid-state NMR (ssNMR) has recently developed as a powerful structural tool for studying structure and dynamics of solid biological samples at atomic resolution. A number of issues remain however to be addressed before ssNMR is ready to cope with large-sized multi-domain functional assemblies. The proposed project aims to capitalize on new concepts recently introduced by the host institution, to implement innovative solid-state NMR methodologies. Sophisticated experimental approaches will be introduced at high magnetic field, in combination with ultra-fast magic angle spinning (MAS), enabling the structure characterization of non-crystalline assemblies that cannot be currently carried out by any other experimental technique, and notably, the determination at atomic level of the structural details that govern protein-protein interactions in functional assemblies. As a benchmark, we will tackle the interaction mode of the ring-shaped hexameric DnaB helicase with its partner DnaC, an assembly that controls the origin of the DNA replication in E. coli.",0,0
953,209249,No,Modelling Tree Response to Aridity Increase with Traits,"The changes in precipitation patterns that are projected for the coming decades are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts. Despite the potentially dramatic impacts on wood and forest-based ecosystem services, the effect of these changes in the hydrological cycle on European forests is still highly uncertain. One reason for this gap in the knowledge is the inadequacy of the tools currently used to address large-scale land-atmosphere processes at continental scales, the land surface models (LSMs). Indeed, the predictive power of LSMs is hampered by their heavy parameterization of empirical hydrological modules, with parameters fixed per broad plant type irrespective of the environmental conditions. This representation is contradictory to the ecological processes of acclimation and selection and makes the LSMs unsuitable outside of their calibration range especially under extreme conditions. Ecologists have now made progress in describing traits – tree characteristics that define plant growth strategies. Plant traits vary as much within species as between species, as individuals and communities adapt to their environmental conditions. M-TRAIT will bring the latest ecological findings together with a state-of-the-art LSM to model large-scale forest response to droughts. The trait determinants to the drought response of trees will be determined from analysis of worldwide trait databases. The relationships between traits and with the environment will be formulated. The key traits will then be integrated into a forestry-enhanced LSM with an individuals-sampling approach in which a large number of plant growth strategies are initialized and allowed to interact with environmental conditions. The outcome of M-TRAIT will be 100-year simulations of the drought effect on forests under different climate change scenarios, as well as an analysis of the consequences for forest-based ecosystem services based on proxy ecological variables.",1,0
837,4800,No,Brass-board integration of a reformer/fuel cell/battery/electric motor system for electric traction,"Fuel cell driven electric vehicles are expected to achieve efficiencies which are 2 to 3 times higher than petrol or Diesel engines. Two options for fuel exist: hydrogen and methanol. This project deals with a stationary test facility which simulates a fuel cell driven electric vehicle which uses methanol as a fuel. The objective is to develop the technology needed to integrate key components for a reformer/fuel cell/battery hybrid electric vehicle, to perform this integration as well as to assess the performance of the system using realistic drive patterns.  The integration of the components of a fuel cell/battery hybrid power source for an electric vehicle will be carried out in the laboratory, in a 'brass-board' set-up. The system should be able to provide the power needed for van of 5 tonne gross weight, used for delivery services in an urban area. Except for the periodic refuelling with methanol, the brass-board will be completely self supporting in terms of sustaining all internal use of electricity and compressed air. The project will not be aimed at developing fuel reformers, fuel cells or batteries.  The methanol reformer will be constructed by Tecnars (I). It will be a scaled-up version of the reformers developed and built by Tecnars. Only modest modifications will be applied in order to enable the application on the brass-board. The fuel gas will contain trace components that are detrimental to the functioning of the fuel cell. The removal of these by-products of the reforming process will be the responsibility of the Loughborough University of Technology (LUT), thereby assisted by Tecnars.  LUT is also responsible for the initial modelling during the design phase, for the acquisition of realistic drive patterns, for the selection of control strategies as well as for the comparison of test results and model predictions.   The solid polymer fuel cell stacks will be purchased. The design and construction of the system around the stacks will be the responsibility of the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECG). This system will comprise an air compression system to provide the pressurized oxidant flow for the stacks. ECG is also responsible for the final integration and will carry out part of the performance tests. ECG is co-ordinator of the project.   The selection and purchase of the batteries and the testing in combination with an permanent magnet type motor will be done by TNO (Delft, NL). TNO is also responsible for testing of the complete brass-board on a dynamometer test bed, using realistic drive patterns.   Holec Machines & Apparaten BV (NL), is responsible for the design and construction of a supervisory control unit and the communication network needed for the data-acquisition and the control of the various sub-systems.   The brass-board project will result in new knowledge and techniques pertaining to the integration of reformers and fuel cells in an electric vehicle. This knowledge will be useful for setting the goals for the application specific development of fuel cells, reformers, batteries and super-capacitors. The brass-board facility could in future be used to test such new components in an integrated environment resembling that of an electric vehicle.",0,0
456,198734,No,ERC = ScienceSquared,"The ERC is a great success scientifically, and now wants to broaden its popular and political support. But it has a problem: Most EU citizens don’t care about some Brussels agency they never heard of. The solution is in the ERC’s mandate: frontier research. It has science – the cutting edge variety, that can capture the imagination, change the world and stimulate curiosity. We have seen the power of a fundamental science story elsewhere, and how it can focus attention on the institution behind it: the Higgs boson and CERN.  It takes high scientific achievement, great story-telling, a tight focus, creative communications and a sustained effort to build a mass following in science. We believe the ERC can achieve this – to matter as the source of cool science, to students, investors, policy makers, researchers, and all citizens generally, in all 28 EU member-states and beyond. The ERC can invent science and mirror it back to society. In short, ERC = ScienceSquared.  To convey this message, the ERC = ScienceSquared campaign will promote ERC projects and grantees through a cluster of innovative, popular and high quality content packages – punchy videos, long-form ‘snowfall’ articles, tiny Tweets, augmented reality, ‘pop-up’  displays – which will be adapted to a new research theme every six months. The content packages will be used in ten science museums, 34 universities, hundreds of online media channels and many other outlets covering 37 countries. These will be sustainable communication channels, which the ERC can continue using when the contract is over, targeting key audience segments: more than 40 million people. This campaign – as ‘cool’ as the ERC itself - will stir interest in science, raise awareness of the ERC as a science power, build broader political and societal support for the ERC – and encourage grant applications from a new generation of researchers, especially in countries under-represented among ERC grantees.",0,0
1010,106167,No,Terrestrial Gamma Flashes-the Most Energetic Photon Phenomenon in our Atmosphere,"'Only 20 years after the discovery of Cosmic Gamma-ray Bursts from the universe another completely unknown phenomenon involving gamma-rays was discovered by coincidence the BATSE instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. Short-lived (~1 ms) and very energetic photon emissions (>1 MeV and later: >40 MeV) were found to originate from the Earth’s atmosphere and were named Terrestrial Gamma Flashes (TGFs). These flashes are the most energetic natural photon phenomenon that is known to exist on Earth, in which also anti-matter is produced. Based on the few datasets available to date we believe that TGFs are related to electric discharges in thunderstorm systems and that electrons accelerated to relativistic energies are involved to produce bremsstrahlung of such high energies. However, it is not known how frequent TGFs are, the altitude range and the spatial extent of their source region, to what kind of thunderstorms and lightning they are related or the implications of relativistic electrons and positrons ejected into space. There is no consensus on how TGFs are produced. All these questions need to be answered before we understand how important they are and how they may affect the Earth’s electrical circuit and atmosphere.  The goal of the TGF-MEPPA project is to attack these questions by combining modelling of electron acceleration in thunderstorm electric fields, X- and gamma-ray production and propagation, lightning development with unprecedented measurements of TGFs from three different altitudes: 350 km, 30 km  and 20 km to obtain the most comprehensive and detailed dataset needed to make significant advances in the TGF research. I will also perform electric discharge experiments in the laboratory. The goal is to establish a consistent model for the TGF-production and answer the question ‘How common are TGFs?’ to determine their implications for the Earth’s electrical circuit, atmosphere and outer space.'",0,0
3,198651,Yes,Atmospheric dynamics Research InfraStructure in Europe,"It has been robustly demonstrated that variations in the circulation of the middle atmosphere influence weather and climate throughout the troposphere all the way to the Earth’s surface. A key part of the coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere occurs through the propagation and breaking of planetary-scale Rossby waves and gravity waves. Limited observation of the middle atmosphere and these waves in particular limits the ability to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of the middle atmosphere in numerical weather prediction and climate models. ARISE2 capitalizes upon the work of the EU-funded first ARISE project combining for the first time international networks with complementary technologies such as infrasound, lidar and airglow. This joint network provided advanced data products that started to be used as benchmarks for weather forecast models. The ARISE network also allows enhanced and detailed monitoring of other extreme events in the Earth system such as erupting volcanoes, magnetic storms, tornadoes and tropical thunderstorms. In order to improve the ability of the network to monitor atmospheric dynamics, ARISE2 proposes to extend i) the existing network coverage in Africa and the high latitudes, ii) the altitude range in the stratosphere and mesosphere, iii) the observation duration using routine observation modes, and to use complementary existing infrastructures and innovative instrumentations. Data will be collected over the long term to improve weather forecasting to monthly or seasonal timescales, to monitor atmospheric extreme events and climate change. Compared to the first ARISE project, ARISE2 focuses on the link between models and observations for future assimilation of data by operational weather forecasting models. Among the applications, ARISE2 proposes infrasound remote volcano monitoring to provide notifications to civil aviation.

For both purposes development of methodologies will be conducted with the goal of reassessing the safety margins using less conservative approaches and considering the new risks that rose from the original design or design extension phases. This will reinforce the confidence on these safety margins for conditions up to the extended design domain, will allow the identification of new accident management measures and devices and will support the optimization of the potential associated emergency population protection measures. Improvement of evaluations tools will be supported by the reassessment of the existing experimental and analytical databases. The efficiency of the approach will be demonstrated by comparing at start and then at the end of the project the results of the evaluation of a series of reactor cases selected by a senior expert group among two main categories: loss of coolant accidents and steam generator tube rupture accidents.   Detailed analyzes of these reactor cases simulations will suggest the development of harmonized evaluation methodologies.

In a recent case report, epidural electrostimulation combined with an intense training enabled some highly variable conscious motor control of legs in four motor complete spinal cord injured volunteers. The aim of understanding the mechanisms behind these improvements can help define more effective pharmacological and electrical stimulating protocols with breakthrough technology to restore functions after a SCI. Experiments will be performed on adult rats, with an experimental SCI closer to human chronic lesions, on which I will apply the novel enabling protocol with epidural electrostimulation associated with an intense motor training. Outcome will be evaluated with innovative combinations of electromyographic and kinematic assessments of locomotion and standing posture, in vivo terminal intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons and histological examination of spared axons across the lesion. Then, I will employ carbon nanotubes to devise nanostructured innovative stimulation arrays for a more specific and focussed epidural stimulation to enhance recovery.  The unique experience of Prof. Edgerton and Prof. Ballerini will allow me to acquire new skills on both preclinical SCI models and assessments and nanotechnologies, to increase my international collaborations, support my research through greater funds and a new in vivo research line, with the aims of obtaining a professorship and a greater visibility in the field.

258,210962,No,"Family ties that bind: A new view of internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes","Internal migration (long-distance moves within national borders) is generally assumed to be beneficial to individuals and households. This FamilyTies project has been designed to make a decisive contribution to a much more comprehensive explanation of internal migration and its labour-market outcomes than current, mainly economic, explanations have achieved thus far. It introduces a novel perspective on internal migration and immobility, which focuses on the role of family outside the household in deciding on whether and where to relocate, and which takes into account contemporary family complexity: the family ties perspective. The aim is to identify the role of family ties in internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes. The objectives are: 1. Identifying the role of family ties as a deterrent of migration and key determinant of immobility. 2. Explaining migration towards family in relation to migration in other directions. 3. Determining to what extent and for whom family-related motives drive migration and immobility. 4. Unravelling how individual labour-market outcomes of migration versus immobility differ between (im)mobility related to family ties and (im)mobility due to other factors. Geo-coded register and census data containing micro-links between family members will be used for Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as survey data for Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA and New Zealand. These will be analysed using advanced applications of hazard regression, logistic regression, OLS regression and structural equation models, which take into account the multilevel and multi-actor structure of the data and issues of endogeneity and self-selection. The project will provide major new insights into migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes, and input for better predictions and policies concerning migration, population growth and decline, ethnic segregation, labour-market flexibility and family support.",1,0

946,92572,No,Development of an Antibacterial Cloth Based on Microfibre,"In the CleanCloth project, we propose to develop a superior cleaning cloth with constant and continuous antibacterial effect, ensuring that no bacteria is left in the cloth and making bacterial re-growth impossible, without need for special and time-consuming hygiene procedures. This will be accomplished by a unique technology with antibacterial agent integrated into the microfiber of the cloth. The advances in this technology will allow significant reduction of cross-contamination and bacterial regrowth.   Infectious diseases arising in the home setting are a significant concern. A significant amount of infections, not only food-borne but also person-to-person, relate to cross contamination via hands, surfaces or other bacteria containing objects such as the kitchen-cloth. Pathogenic and potentially pathogenic species are introduced as microbial contamination into the home and public places such as hospitals, day care centres, offices and hotels on a regular basis via people, pets and insects as well as in food, water and via air. Wet sites, such as kitchen areas, toilets and bathrooms are most commonly associated with heavy contamination and potentially harmful species. However, other wet sites such as dishcloths and cleaning utensils have also been found to be heavily contaminated. Contamination in the kitchen is most frequently caused by raw food, but the sink, waste trap and surrounding areas can also act as semi-permanent sources or reservoirs of bacteria. Gram negative species such as E. Coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonads have been shown to grow to substantial numbers in sink U-tube and toilet water, as well as in contaminated wet cloths. The reservoir/disseminator sites such as wet cloths and cleaning utensils have a high risk of germs being present, a constant risk for spread of germs and are always in need for adequate hygiene procedures",0,0

Most research focusses on one or two of these challenges at a time; there is a major scientific gap in understanding synergies and inevitable trade-offs between the development principles of environmental sustainability, equitability, efficiency and resilience.  This project aims to analyse synergies and trade-offs between environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social equity and social-ecological resilience in the context of land and water use for food and energy supply. We consider production, consumption and trade patterns globally, at high spatial resolution, analyse past developments, and develop alternative future pathways, based on coherent sets of assumptions regarding demographic and economic developments, technological innovation, changes in local diets and energy mixes, and climate change.  The project team will pioneer in integrating methods and computational tools from the fields of Environmental Footprint Assessment, Life Cycle Assessment and Input-Output Analysis, applied at unrivalled high level of granularity. Coherent perspectives on handling uncertainty and risk from cultural theory will be used in a unique approach to develop alternative futures. Finally, an original framework will be developed to analyse synergies and traded-offs between competing development principles.  The project will revolutionize our understanding of different pathways to food and energy security given limited land and water resources, and particularly how each pathway will make trade-offs between environmental sustainability, fair sharing, efficient resources use and resiliency. This knowledge is key in understanding how to achieve UN’s Sustainable Development Goals with limited land and water resources and reveal synergies and trade-offs embedded in specific strategies.",1,1
835,3612,No,MANGANESE RECOVERY FROM ORES BY BIOLEACHING PROCESS,"The overall aim of the project is to develop low cost, environmental consistent biometallurgical technique for the exploitation of community manganese resources.  A low cost and environmentally friendly process has been developed for the exploitation of domestic European manganese resources which involves biometallurgical procedures.  The research covered the following steps: localization, collection and preparation of the manganese ore samples from selected deposits and mines; chemical, mineralogical and petrographic characterization of the raw materials; identification of the liberation functions of the minerals in the various comminution classes; concentration by magnetic and gravimetric separation methods of the manganese ore; bioleaching tests at laboratory scale on the different ores by computerized factorial design of experiments. Various species of microorganism (in pure or mixed cultures) were tested for the dissolution of manganese. Heterotrophic microorganisms (Aspergillus niger) have proved to be robust and effective (40% yield after 7 days) unlike autotrophic (Thiobacillus species) that have shown only reduced manganese dissolution (20% yield after 15 days). The best results have been generally achieved when using mixed cultures, where the most active species was represented by Agrobacter radiobacter.  The chemical reactions involved in the process were identified and a factorial design of experiments was applied to the bioleaching tests using mixed cultures. The behaviour of manganese oxide was easily detected by the disappearance of the typical brown colour. The leached manganese was distributed partially in the solution (30%), on the microorganisms (20%) and the remaining 50% in the precipitated manganese carbonate. The influence of the particle size, medium composition, sucrose concentration on the dissolution of manganese has been evaluated. Manganese extraction was greatly affected by a decrease of particle size in the range 65 to 200 um. Sucrose and ammonium nitrate and yeast extract had a remarkable positive effect on manganese dissolution. Significant differencies have been experimentally as certained when comparing the shaken flasks system with the biofermentator. In fact more high recoveries have been obtained in the first type of reactor. Whilst manganese dissolution occurs in reducing conditions, it has been emphasized that the biochemical reduction of manganese if favoured in aerobic conditions. At present, there are only 2 EEC countries with manganese resources large and rich enough to be of commercial interest namely, Italy (Northern Lazio and Sardinia) and Greece (Drama area in Macedonia). The economic assessment of the overall results of the process will be evaluated together with the possible impact that this new process can bring about to other manganese deposits.   The work will involve the following stages.  Indispensable personnel, materials and means will be disposed for the appropriate collection and preparation of the manganese ore samples from the selected mines to be used in the project.  A complete minero-petrographic and chemical analysis of the ore will be performed by means of inductive coupled plasma spectrophotometry and plasma mass spectroscopy. Mineralogical analysis will utilize X-ray diffractometry and surface analysis will use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and fourier transform infrared(FTIR).  Identification of the liberation function of the minerals in the various classes of the comminution products.  Design of bioleaching experiments for the 2 manganese ores will be performed by means of computerized fractional factorial designs of experiments. Different microorganisms from several bearing ores will be collected, cultivated and isolated to perform a preliminary study for the identification of the most capable and efficient manganese ore leacher. Different bioleaching tests will be performed in order to identify the best operation conditions of such process. The overall process will be optimized by taking advantage of the statistical analysis (computerized variance analysis, evaluation of single and cross factors contribution) of the data obtained experimentally. Mechanism of manganese dissolution during bioleaching tests as well as kinetic aspects will also be investigated.  Samples from occurrences or from the existing plant will be treated by gravimetric and magnetic separation methods.  Both the residues and the head samples will be treated by microorganisms.  After completion of laboratory scale bioleaching experiments, pilot plant tests will be scheduled to be run on the installations at the University of L'Aquila on 300 kg samples.  According to the pilot plant tests, a preliminary economic evaluation of the overall results of the method (conventional and  bioleaching or bioleaching) will be undertaken in order to assess the economic feasibility of such a process.",0,0

718,194369,No,Grey and green in Europe: elderly living in urban areas,"The EU has to face many challenges in achieving a more balanced regional development and sustainable economic recovery. Many of those challenges have to do with the ageing population trend, urbanization and environment under distress. More liveable and efficient communities is a target to be reached in Europe, where the “silver hair” trends can become a challenging opportunity, from a social, economic and cultural perspective. Despite those challenges are strongly interlinked, solutions provided in urban contexts not often pay due attention to the social process underlying urban trends and to the needs and behaviour of elderly citizens.  GRAGE intends to contribute to fill this gap, developing winning ideas to promote an active, harmonious and inclusive citizenship for elderly people living in urban contexts. The consortium gathers ground-breaking expertise from different scientific background (legal, economic, humanities, engineering), from academic and non academic institutions, belonging to several countries (from EU and Ukraine). Using a mix of methodologies, the research and innovation programme of the project will evolve around the idea of citizenship as a collector of interest, healthy environment and suitable urban solutions for an aging society. Main themes will be: green buildings, food and urban agriculture, information and language technology. Researcher will analyze their role in transforming cities in environments that support green and healthy lifestyles for elderly people. GRAGE intents to boost dialogue through Europe, both strengthening the academic and non-academic collaboration and a practical understanding of elderly living across Europe. Such a cooperation can have a series of returns for Europe, ranging from a more effective solution to strategic challenges (sustainable cities and demographic change) to new business opportunities for European firms, offering solutions and products for smart/inclusive/ageing societies at global level.",0,0
295,206905,No,Tackling the Achilles Heel of Immunotherapy: Validating imaging biomarkers and targeting the immunological niche of tumour hypoxia,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide with 1.59 million deaths annually and it places the highest economic burden of all cancers on the EU at €18.8billion. These figures call for a major transformation of the therapeutic management of lung cancer. The recent developments in immunotherapy give new hope. At present a significant minority of patients benefit from immune therapy, which remains not curative when delivered alone. It is thus clear that improving the efficacy of immune therapy is needed as well as the identification of predictive biomarkers. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy improves effectiveness, but resistance is still common, most probably because of hypoxia. In HYPOXIMMUNO, we will open up a new paradigm in treating metastatic NSCLC. I will provide for the first time (pre)clinical proof of concept of (i) highly innovative CT-based radiomics and PET-hypoxia imaging patient stratification tools and (ii) a tri-modal curative hypoxia-targeting treatment strategy that complements current immunotherapy and radiotherapy approaches. This tri-modal curative treatment strategy is based on (1) high precision Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SABR) to kill cancer cells and trigger the immune system, combined with (2) a hypoxia-activated prodrug to target the hypoxic tumour cells resistant to immunotherapy and (3) a promising and innovative tumour specific antibody (Ab)-based immunotherapy (immunocytokine L19-IL2 to “push the accelerator” with or without a checkpoint inhibitor to “release the break”) to form a powerful synergistic immuno-oncology strategy. In HYPOXIMMUNO, I envision to lay the foundation for the next breakthrough in oncology, by improving patient selection and developing highly innovative cancer therapies that target hypoxia, to improve the quality of life and prolong survival of cancer patients, in particular patients with metastatic NSCLC (watch the animation summarising the project: https://youtu.be/oP9Gp4a0b_Q).",0,0

152,215004,No,Warrior Elites: Assessing their Presence and Organisational identity in Neolithic Europe,"The origins of human conflict, up to and including warfare, lie not in historical documents but in the prehistoric archaeological record. While some evidence is ambiguous, injuries to the skeleton are the indisputable result of real incidents. Neolithic (6000-3000 BC) graves of the Mid-Upper Ebro and Mid-Upper Rhine valleys (northern Spain and northeastern France, respectively) contain skeletons with skeletal trauma and/or arrowhead injuries. Some of these may represent massacres involving many individuals. Moreover, emerging isotopic evidence suggests the existence of specialised warriors among them – potentially the first such in Europe. This reflects a rise in social unrest and provides an outstanding opportunity for investigating almost intangible cultural aspects. The WEAPON (Warrior Elites: Assessing their Presence and Organisational identity in Neolithic Europe) project proposes an unprecedented interdisciplinary approach to explore the identity and life-histories of those involved in the violence observed in this pivotal period. A combination of analytical methods will be used to this end, including stable carbon, nitrogen and sulphur analysis of bone collagen and tooth dentine, strontium and oxygen analysis of tooth enamel, and radiocarbon dating. The research aims to confirm the existence of ‘specialised warriors’, as well as to investigate if violence, whether regular or not, may relate to the emergence of inequalities and/or population movements across Neolithic Europe.",0,0
536,211496,No,"A unique life-saving smart-watch for high quality, not-invasive, continuous blood pressure monitoring.","Human body tries to keep blood pressure as stable and constant as possible, so its instabilities are indicators of systemic problems. Among 1 B people affected by hypertension, however, blood pressure monitoring is ineffective at least in 47% of them, leading to 9 M deaths/year globally. Current monitors for self blood pressure monitoring show main drawbacks: they interfere with daily activities, often lack of reliability and standards, and only allow to measure the blood pressure intermittently, so information on the blood pressure trend is not available. BP24 is a wearable medical device for noninvasive, continuous and highly accurate blood pressure monitoring, specifically targeting patients with hypertension and inpatients. Vita Sentry’s proprietary core technology enables a unique approach that takes into account the vascular tone to compute the value of BP, instead of simply estimating it from the measure of the blood flow. By detecting the diameter of arteries and arterioles with an accuracy of 0.5 μm over a measurement range, BP24 is the unique wearable intended for highly accurate -golden-standard comparable- BP monitoring. Therefore, not only it can be used by patients with hypertension, but in the future it will be used in patients undergoing surgeries – and the company’s efforts are directed towards that objective. Vita Sentry’s technology is enabling: being vasodilation and vasoconstriction in a number of physiological processes, knowing the arteries and arteriole diameters will allow to measure the metabolic rate and the stress level of a person. While this is a long-term objective, going to the market with BP24 for self-monitoring of people with hypertension is the goal of the innovation project.

437,193862,No,Postgraduate Research on Dilute Metamorphic Nanostructures and Metamaterials in Semiconductor Photonics,"Photonics, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing technologies have been identified as key enabling technologies (KETs) for the EU. Today the photonics global market alone is around €300 billion and Europe has established a strong position with a total share of 20%, directly employing about 290,000 people. However, the shortage of sufficient skilled labour and entrepreneurs capable of handling the highly multi-disciplinary nature of KETs remains a major problem in the EU. Tailoring of semiconductors at the nanoscale is an important enabling technology for a wide range of photonics and electronics applications in diverse areas. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 15 early stage researchers will be trained in the full range of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures.

Among those, malignancies associated with human papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and human T-cell leukemia virus are of significant clinical importance, and particularly as secondary infections in immunosuppressed patients. We plan to analyze the molecular basis for the pathogenic effects of these viruses, which is largely unknown. There is evidence that infection by these viruses' influences a number of regulatory pathways, which control proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the host cells. Several cellular targets have now been identified for each of these viruses: Viral oncoproteins have been shown to interfere with various signal transduction pathways, to inactivate growth-suppressive nuclear proteins by direct binding, and to modulate the expression of key cell cycle regulatory genes. Furthermore, some viral oncogenes act by modulating the function of pS3, thereby influencing the apoptotic response of their host cells. Although some of these interactions have been analysed in considerable detail, a systematic analysis of these interactions is lacking. It is a major objective of the present proposal to analyse the possibility that common pathways are used by the different viruses to override growth control.  Special attention will be devoted to a molecular analysis of the interaction of viral proteins with nuclear targets, including pS3, the pRb family, and the transcription factors E2F, NF-kB and RBP-Jk. Similarly, the modulation of cellular signal transduction pathways by viral gene products will be analysed. By comparative analysis of the pathways used by each virus, it should be possible to obtain an integrated view of how human tumor viruses override growth control in their host cells, and determine whether these pathways are common to different viruses, or whether they are restricted to certain virus families. As a major benefit from these studies we anticipate a significant increase in our knowledge about the pathogenesis of the diseases associated with infections by these viruses in both healthy and immuno-suppressed patients. The work proposed here should lead to a better understanding of viral oncogenesis, and help to design novel diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for the virus-associated diseases.",0,0

Most funding organisations in Europe participate, either directly or as associated members. The project also fosters international cooperation with funding organisations outside Europe. FLAG-ERA thus offers a platform to coordinate a wide range of sources of funding towards the realization of very ambitious research goals.FLAG-ERA contributes to the construction of the two Flagship initiatives on Graphene and Human Brain research, and also offers support to the four non-selected pilots to progress towards their goals with adapted means. It does so through a range of activities. In order to enable researchers funded through various sources to work in tight cooperation with each other in the context of the two Flagships, the funding organisations in FLAG-ERA coordinate their funding framework conditions. In order to enhance complementarities and synergies of regional, national and European research programmes and initiatives, the funding organisations share information on these programmes and initiatives, identify gaps and overlaps, and can thus adapt their thematic program and launch new initiatives according to the identified needs. In particular, they can launch transnational calls enabling researchers from different countries to propose joint contributions to the Flagships. Additionally, in order to encourage the actual construction of the Flagships and take-up of their results, the funding organisations organise networking sessions for the research communities and other stakeholders, including industry.The activities in FLAG-ERA are organised around periodic events gathering all stakeholders and structured in sessions dedicated to the various objectives and related tasks of the project.

308,40067,No,Maximum oxidation rates in the free troposphere,"There are still severe limits to our understanding of processes which control tropospheric ozone and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and hence also the air quality at the earth's surface. The aim of this proposal is to employ a well integrated combination of airborne measurements with state-of-the art statistical and deterministic models to address some of the uncertainties related to resolving the relationship between pollutant emissions and the concentration distribution of ozone and other species related to the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere.  The main objective of the project is to investigate how the annual cycle of ozone in the troposphere is influenced by atmospheric pollution on a continental and hemispheric scale from the surface and up to the upper troposphere. Specifically, it will be investigated if there  is a chemical cause for the spring/summertime ozone maximum in background air over Europe and the North Atlantic. It will be investigated if there is major ozone destruction in the free troposphere in summer outside of the polluted layers which are often found throughout the troposphere over the North Atlantic. The concentration contrasts in ozone, precursors and intermediate species including free radicals, between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free troposphere will be measured over the European continent, including the Iberian Peninsula, and over the adjacent ocean. The data will be applied to assess the strength of the exchange of pollution between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free troposphere starting in February and continuing until July. It will furthermore be investigated if comprehensive chemical measurements in the atmospheric boundary layer and the free troposphere can show that a concentration range exists for oxides of nitrogen where the oxidation rates of precursors have maxima, as indicated by theoretical calculations, and also, where there is a shift from net photochemical production of ozone to net photochemical destruction.  The project is centred around measurements from the Meteorological Research Flight C- 130 aircraft with a range of 5000 km and a ceiling of 10 km equipped with very extensive and advanced instrumentation for a complete set of measurement of chemical precursors, photooxidants and intermediate products including radical species.  The measurements will allow the calculation of the hydroxyl radical concentration and the net chemical formation rate of ozone in near real time, allowing a very detailed mapping of their variability in space and with time. Measurements will be carried out in late winter, during spring and early summer in a range of weather situations outside of major cloud systems, with vertical profiles from the ground to the upper troposphere in combination with horizontal trancepts in the free troposphere over Europe including the Iberian Peninsula and over the North Atlantic. In support of the aircraft measurements and to address the scientific questions in the project, 3-dimensional numerical models will be used including an advanced state of the art three-dimensional coupled numerical weather prediction-chemistry model. Algorithms and statistical relationships will be employed to screen the measured results and derive preliminary answers to the scientific questions related to the objectives of the project. Later the numerical models will be applied to assimilate the measured results into the model calculations in order to enhance the diagnostic as well as predictive capability of the models.  In this way their reliability as tools for assessing the consequences for air quality of planned abatement measures will be enhanced. The project therefore will contribute significantly to the combat of air pollution. The instrumentation and the methodology for interpretation draw heavily on the development, investment and experience in previous projects funded by the Commission and by other international and national research agencies (OCTA, TACIA and others) and the concortium includes six well-known partners in four European countries.",1,0

Recently, Xf was introduced into Italy, where it is causing severe damage to olive crops, and in France, where so far it is limited to ornamental plants and some landscape trees. The overall goal of the research program is to assess Xf potential to spread throughout EU territory, while maximizing its impact through a multifactor approach, based on a seamless integration amongst the 29 partners involved. Proposed actions will be complementary to those carried out under the Project POnTE - 635646, thus ensuring an unbroken continuity with currently ongoing efforts. Specific objectives have been outlined following a step-by-step route, from preventing its introduction into pest-free areas to the establishment of successful eradication strategies in infected zones. Preventive measures against Xf will be strengthened by implementing EU certification programs and developing a plan for establishing a EU Clean Plant Network. EU policy makers will be supported through the development of pest risk assessment tools, focused on current outbreaks and forecasting potentially threatened regions. Surveillance will be properly implemented, supporting the development of early detection tools for field use, remote sensing technology and predictive modelling. Critical information on the pathogen biology, epidemiological traits and hosts under threat, will be gathered with the guidance of the American research groups with long-established research. At the same time, the insect-bacteria interactions will be determined, for developing strategic control measures. The final overall objective is a comprehensive integrated management strategy for diseases associated with Xf, applicable both IPM and organic farming systems, to prevent Xf spread, control its economic, environmental/social impact, when an outbreak would occur.",0,0

572,32011,No,Transnational Environmental Management Support and Information System,"TEMSIS will employ telematics to help public authorities in a cross-border region inform citizens of ongoing policies to upgrade its environment in the wake of industrial transformation. The project will provide tools to gather already available data into a transnational network where opinions on environment matters can be fed into decision-making early on. Information to facilitate such participation will be available at central public locations, or at home on the Internet. The longer-term aim will be a complex distributed support and information system giving communities a substantial say in regional policies for a better environment.  The demonstration region for the TEMSIS project is the Saar-Rosselle Region, which consists of the urban agglomeration of Saarbrücken and Moselle Est. The whole region shares a common industrial history. For over a century its industry was shaped by coal, iron and steel. For the past 25 years radical structural changes have been taking place. This has left the region with a number of serious environmental problems. The communities on both sides of the border have been meeting for a number of years to discuss their common problems. Any decisions concerning new industrial development on one side of the traditional border, like a new public transportation systems or the SMART Car Production near Sarreguemines, will have environmental as well as social impact on the region as a whole, without respecting the national frontier. Environmental impact statements are usually necessary in preparing decisions by local authorities. The participation of citizens is required by national laws and European guidelines. Local authorities will inform their citizens about the various projects and their impact. Because general interest in environmental problems has been increasing, the TEMSIS project will develop tools to help citizens as well as experts in administrations in their discussions about how sustainable development can be achieved. It will inform citizens about the day-to-day changes in their local environment, presenting it either in central places like the City Hall or in their homes through Internet if they have access to it. These measures require efficient tools to gather information quickly from diverse sources, e.g. from local or regional environmental information systems. TEMSIS will provide a trans-national environmental information network, where environmental views can be introduced into decision processes at an early stage. Applying advanced telecommunication technology to environmental problems will increase the strength and quality of the decision-making process and have a considerable social impact as a result. The demonstrator prepares the basis for a complex distributed support and information system which provides users with access to a large reservoir of environmental information backed by interpersonal desktop collaboration services. Thus the TEMSIS project will be a good starting-point for the communities in the user group to improve the environmental quality in the region.   Major Validation Sites Stadtverband Saarbrücken, DE Ville de Sarreguemines, FR   Users The inter-communal work group managed by the Stadtverband Saarbrücken and Ville de Sarreguemines comprises over twenty Cities and local government associations ('Kreise' or 'Districts'). In addition, organised citizen groups, regional and national authorities and industrial enterprises are represented.  Approach Use will be made of existing standard GIS, standard market relational DBMS accessed via ODBC, UNIX based products like GDB-x to store Geo-Data on the server, viewer systems like WinCat for Geo Data visualisation, with a product like InfoDesk being customised for a common user interface.  Expected Benefits - easier access to more up-to-date environmental information (knowing about changes in environmental conditions in the shortest time is especially important in regions with high levels of environmental pollution) - help with administrative and political decisions, especially in regions with environmental problems - help in clarifying complicated facts, by means of multimedia presentation in the form of maps, pictures etc. - clearer comparisons between similar or different regions - improved decision-making through greater cooperation between administrations - use of Info.Kiosks to inform citizens, thus reaching a wide segment of the public: there are more then 60,000 communities in the EU with this potential, which enterprises are using increasingly.

466,74768,No,lightning protection for structures and systems on aircraft utilising lightweight composites.,"The European Aviation Industry has been quick to use lightweight composite materials, especially Carbon Fibre, for primary structures and flight control surfaces. Composites are lightweight, stiff, and provide smooth, aerodynamically efficient surfaces.C arbon Fibre is particularly attractive because it has good corrosion and fatigue properties. This results in enhanced efficiency and performance and a significant weight reduction.However,lightning protection is d ifficult to incorporate into a composite aircraft compared to a conventional aluminium one. Composite airframes also give less electromagnetic shielding compared to aluminium, making it more difficult to protect avionic systems. Both aspects are worse for light aircraft because of their small size and low weight.This proposal addresses the nee d to optimise lightning protection systems for aircraft withlightweight composite structure. It will allow manufacturers to make safe use of the performance advantage provided by such materials.Work will include: The identification of lightning protection solutions for lightweight composite structure.

This continues efforts of the previous FCH JU supported HyLIFT-DEMO project. In the HyLIFT-EUROPE project the partners demonstrate fuel cell systems in material handling vehicles from the partner STILL and from non-participating OEMs. STILL purchases fuel cell systems from suppliers according to the FCH JU purchasing rules (“principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness”). Fuel cell vehicles from other non-participating OEMs are also demonstrated due to identified customer needs. The high volume combined with the FCH JU support is enabling a cost-neutral demonstration operation for vehicle-users. Dialogues have been established with 33 vehicle-users with a combined fleet of 2,097 vehicles of the types targeted for demonstration. At the vehicle-user sites 2 hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) are to be deployed (initially the deployment of 5-20 HRS was planned) using the latest technology by Air Liquide. To arrive at the target hydrogen price of 8-12 €/kg (average target < 10 €/kg) dispensed at the pump, vehicle deployment locations are to be chosen close to hydrogen production locations whenever possible in order to arrive at the lowest hydrogen supply cost.

Society also expects from agriculture to be more environment-friendly in several issues such as climatic change, declining biodiversity, fossil energy depletion, and water shortage. To overcome these limitations, CANTOGETHER will design innovative sustainable mixed farming systems (MFS). A design-assessment-adjustment iterative cycle will be adopted to ensure continuous validation and improvement of the innovative investigated MFS through a participative approach involving stakeholders and researchers across Europe. It will bring together a European network of 24 existing experimental and commercial farms covering a wide diversity of natural and socio-economic conditions in which the most promising MFS will be implemented in order to verify their practicability and to perform an in-depth integrated assessment (economic and environmental). The MFS will be designed for individual farm level or collective implementation at the territorial level. At the same time, CANTOGETHER will define recommendations for a common agricultural policy promoting the development of these MFS. The innovative analysed MFS will be based on the simultaneous utilization of crops (cash, feed and energetic) and various rearing animals with full recycling practices of animal wastes in view to ensure high resource-use efficiency (notably of nutrients), reduction in dependence on external inputs (fertilisers, pesticides, concentrated feeds), and acceptable environmental and economic performances.

The efficient energy generation and use of clean energy are the effective pathways for solving these problems. This project promotes a cutting-edge research collaboration on the development of the late-model multi-junction nano-materials for energy applications in relation with solar energy driven production of hydrogen from water and rechargeable battery for renewable energy storage. Using a modified electrochemical atomic layer deposition method, multi-junction materials with large specific surface areas or complex shapes can be produced with a formation mechanism of atom-by-atom growth. Based on this, the narrow-band-gap semiconductors are conformally deposited onto TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTs) to form a coaxial heterogeneous structure with atomic-level control. Such structure can greatly improve the separation efficiency of photo-induced electrons and holes, resulting in a highly active photocurrent generation. On the other hand, both sulphur and carbon atomic layers are deposited alternately on the TiO2 NT walls in the atom-by-atom contact form. The resultant sulphur-carbon/TiO2 NTs multi-junction positive electrodes demonstrate properties useful for resolving these bottleneck problems that exist in the current Li-S battery. Furthermore, the relationships among the optimizing designs (including micro-geometrical structures, compositional control, and atomic-level interface properties), the charge transfer mechanism, and electrochemical performance are studied. On the basis of these results, the high-performance multi-junction photocatalysts and rechargeable Li-S battery are carried out for hydrogen generation and energy storage application.

799,91306,No,Engine Representative Internal Cooling Knowledge and Applications,"The goal of ERICKA is to directly contribute to reductions in aircraft engine fuel consumption with a targeted contribution of 1% reduction in SFC relative to engines currently in service.  The fuel efficiency of a jet engine used for aircraft propulsion is dependent on the performance of many key engine components.  One of the most important is the turbine whose efficiency has a large influence on the engine fuel consumption and hence its CO2 emissions. The turbine must operate with high efficiency in the most hostile environment in the engine.   The design of turbine cooling systems remains one of the most challenging processes in engine development. Modern high-pressure turbine cooling systems invariably combine internal convection cooling with external film cooling in complex flow systems whose individual features interact in complex ways.  The heat transfer and cooling processes active are at the limit of current understanding and engine designers rely heavily on empirical tools and engineering judgement to produce new designs.   ERICKA will provide a means of improving turbine blade cooling technology that will reduce turbine blade cooling mass-flow relative to that required using existing technology.  A reduction in cooling mass-flow leads directly to improved component and engine efficiency.  The improved technology for turbine cooling developed by ERICKA will also enable low NOx combustion chambers to be included in future engines.   ERICKA will undertake research to furnish better understanding of the complex flows used to internally cool rotating turbine blades. This will be achieved by:-  1) Acquisition of high quality experimental data using static and rotating test facilities 2) Development of cooling design capability by enhancement of computer codes that will exploit these experimental data   ERICKA groups 18 partners representing the European aero engine industry, five SMEs and a set of leading academic institutions.",0,0

This research will focus on safety in design from a user-centred perspective, and will apply human factors knowledge and structured risk management methods to the equipment design process. It will build on the applicant’s previous work in the industrial and transportation domains. In these domains, new technologies are too often designed and deployed without full consideration of the human element in equipment operation and maintenance, often with resultant safety issues.  Firstly, a ‘Safety in Design Ergonomics’ (SIDE) technique will be developed and applied to mobile equipment in the industrial domain. This domain is proposed as it builds on the Applicant’s contacts where he currently works (Australia) plus his existing contacts in Europe (particularly the UK). In addition, the safe design of such industrial mobile equipment has long been a key issue in mining, manufacturing and construction.  Second, the SIDE technique will be evaluated, adapted and applied to new equipment and technologies in another field, most likely in the transportation domain. Third, safety in design for older workers will be considered; considering their strengths and limitations, the SIDE technique will be extended to include this growing (and valuable) workforce sector. This will build on the existing contacts of both the host (such as, their inclusive design research) and the applicant (such as, his transportation work).  The outcome of the research will be a robust SIDE technique that focuses specifically on the human element.

138,222983,No,Resolving Effects of particle Shape and Inertia in Scalar Transport,"When small, rigid particles are immersed in a turbulent fluid, they tumble, slip, concentrate and re-orientate themselves amidst a chaotic flow. Simultaneously, material or heat (passive scalars) may be transferred from the surface by convection and diffusion. Nature and engineering are replete with examples: planktonic osmotrophs absorb nutrients from turbulent ocean waters, and industrial processes grow crystals in agitated suspension, to name but two. Such particles are rarely ever spherical. Yet, present approaches overlook this, neglecting the convective transport mechanisms governed by shape and inertia and fail to predict their consequences, for example, in the adaptation strategies of marine diatoms. To address this problem, this project pairs a researcher with experience of fundamental turbulence physics from working in Germany with an expert in applied experimental fluid mechanics at a UK university, achieving a mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge. The Fellow will parametrically survey the effects of aspect ratio and inertia in the mass transfer to ellipsoidal particles, by reacting deformed ion-exchange resin beads in a turbulent solution to determine transport rates as a function of turbulence, fluid and particle properties. This will be followed by a detailed investigation of the underlying flow physics using state-of-the-art laser induced fluorescence and velocimetry techniques, allowing cause-and-effect mechanisms to be established between macro- and micro-scale effects.

377,203725,No,Cancer treatment and monitoring through identification of circulating tumour cells and tumour related nucleic acids in blood,"Blood-based biomarkers such as Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), circulating free tumor DNA (cfDNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to improve the development of personalized medicines for cancer patients. This is of particular importance when biopsies of the primary tumor or metastases are not accessible (e.g. at early disease stages or in minimal residual disease) or possible and the associated risk of adverse events when taking a biopsy is high. Furthermore, a longitudinal follow-up of disease markers is desirable to improve prognosis or to monitor treatment efficacy. CANCER-ID aims to validate technologies for CTCs, cfDNA and miRNAs to determine the absence/presence of drug targets and assess the response to treatment.  Important challenges for all circulating biomarker development are assay sensitivity, specificity and assay standardization and validation. In three project phases (pre-evaluation, technical assay validation and clinical validation) the CANCER-ID consortium aims at the development and validation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for technologies assessing blood-based biomarkers. In the pre-evaluation phase, four working groups will be established that will evaluate biomarker technologies and set the criteria to be met for any technology before moving to the next phase. In the Technical Evaluation Phase, the technologies identified as promising in the pre-evaluation phase will be implemented and tested at the sites of the consortium members using blood samples taken from patients with metastatic carcinomas and healthy controls.  In order to prove broader applicability and clinical utility of the consortium’s technologies and protocols, the validated assays will be deployed in controlled clinical studies (TRACERx, NVALT-17, SPECTAlung; patients under SoC treatment) in 1) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and 2) anti-Her2-resistant metastatic breast cancer (Her2RMBC). The two indications were chosen based on medical need and economic impact, technical considerations and access to clinical samples. The combination of 17 academic groups (ten large clinical trialsites), 6 EFPIA companies with extensive experience in the use of blood-based biomarkers in clinical trials, 5 SMEs with unique technologies for CTC isolation (Vycap, Leukocare, Gilupi) or for creation of databases, analysis of complex molecular information and data management (Alacris, TATAA) and two non-profit organizations (IBBL, a Biobank with extensive experience in the validation and execution of plasma assays; EORTC, the European organization that aims to develop, conduct, coordinate, and stimulate translational and clinical research) comprises a unique network of experts in the fields of tumour biology, biomarker development, clinical sciences and bioinformatics. In addition, regulatory agencies and patient advocacy groups are involved from the beginning of the project.  The academic leaders of this consortium, Klaus Pantel, who published more than 300 reports and high impact review articles on disseminating tumor cells, and Leon Terstappen, leader of the FDA-approved benchmark CellSearch CTC detection system, are the pioneers of this field. In addition, both have extensive experience with coordination of EU projects in the field (Pantel: DISMAL, CTC-SCAN; Terstappen: CTCTrap). This is complemented by the IMI and FP7 project management experience of the EFPIA project coordinator, Thomas Schlange (Bayer Pharma AG). He will be supported by Barbara Baggiani from Menarini/Silicon Biosystems (developer and vendor of the DEPArray).",0,0

By combining scanning tunnelling microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, an atomic level understanding of the role of nanochemistry and nanostructure are possible to achieve.  This will allow detailed electronic and chemical characterizations of the surface/interface properties of selected biomolecules/SiC systems and also be utilized for characterization of surface structures and nanostructure evolution that are of fundamental interest as well as of importance for device applications. The feasibility of the project is ensured by the expertise of the host institution (MPI, Stuttgart) that has successfully applied this approach to the growth of biomolecular layers before, and by the familiarity of the applicant and host with SiC surface analysis and preparation.

825,209252,No,Behavioural Economics in Network Games,"Three aspects of social interaction shall be combined, namely the diffusion of information in a social network, the formation of social networks, and behavioural (i.e. irrational) aspects in decision making. These three areas are crucially interdependent:  1) unwelcome information and irrational behaviour may lead to a change in a person’s circle of friends and thereby to a change in the social network; 2) the network itself and the (potentially irrational) processing of information influences the information diffusion in a society; 3) the decisions that have to be made with respect to network formation can be influenced by the disutility of unwelcome information rather than the utility of being correctly informed and thereby lead to irrational behaviour. This shall allow for an integrated approach in the analysis of social dynamics. While the three parts of this project already form an ambitious project that will provide considerable academic impact, they will also lead to interesting follow ups and spin-off research that is highly relevant in the upcoming years, such as the analysis of information diffusion in social networks prior to the European Election in 2019, and to applications outside academia, such as optimising product placement and advertisement in social networks, or the development of measures that prevent vigilantism in social networks. The combination of network formation, innovation diffusion, and behavioural economics is not only a novel approach to these rather young research areas with potential impact in economics, psychology, social sciences, and even computer sciences; it is also a highly relevant topic for modern societies where social media play a crucial role in daily communication and information aggregation. This project will therefore not only add to our understanding of social dynamics and  thereby push the academic boundaries, it will also have clear practical implications that allow for a broad exploitation of the research results.",0,0

The objective of the second part is to develop a stochastic modelling approach to account for elements of 'uncertainty' in many forms and to introduce a probabilistic dimension to the structure of the model as well as its results.   The world energy system will be described, in the POLES model, according to a three level structure:   international energy markets  national or regional subsystem   techno-economic subsystems for sectoral consumption models.   During this research project, the following tasks will be achieved:   1) Integration of the supply functions for petroleum and natural gas by producers countries.  2) Integration of synthetic demand functions for energy products.  3) Integration of the prices-functions for coal, petroleum and natural gas.  4) Linkage of the elements with transformation blocks, especially the electrical production system.   The stochastic modelling approach, defined in the second part of the project, must achieve a number of objectives among which are mainly:   Add a whole new dimension to the information provided i.e. instead of producing just points (means) including measures of dispersion or even full distributions.   Enable a proper definition and measurement of risk leading to quantitative assessments of security aspects thus eventually extending to a quantitative valuation of security in the context of externalities.   Provide the essential elements in strategic thinking which avowedly is expected to deal precisely with questions of risk.

441,51252,No,"Tropospheric ozone and precursors - trends, budgets and policy","Problems to be solved One of the fundamental questions at the heart of the air quality problem is 'how much has ozone changed by abatement measures in the past and how much more will it change under the current and future emission reduction plans? In recent years the European Union has put forward and implemented a number of different policies and legislation aimed at improving air quality. It is clear that the chemical composition of the atmosphere over Europe is changing and it is vital to regulate, monitor and understand these changes. Many different factors affect the composition of the troposphere of Europe and these factors act on a range of scales. It is widely recognised that photochemical oxidant production is a problem on the local, regional and global scale. The research within the TROTREP project provides a vital insight into the complex processes leading to ozone formation over Europe and consequently to the contribution of emissions to ozone concentrations. The prime objective of TROTREP is to evaluate, validate and predict the effectiveness of past and future EU air quality legislation with respect to ozone and its precursors. The project increases our knowledge on the extent to which abatement strategies implemented on European emissions will have an effect on ozone concentrations in Europe. TROTREP provides an integrated and strategic study of pollution abatement strategies and their effectiveness based on both measurements and models. TROTREP has a clear scientific and policy orientated role. The main outcome of the project is an analysis of the proportion of ozone in Europe controllable by further emission reductions and the development of a policy instrument to evaluate the success of emission reduction measures taken in the framework of national and EU policy. Scientific objectives and approach In order to evaluate, validate and predict the effectiveness of past and future EU air quality legislation with respect to ozone and its precursors an integrated measurement and modelling approach is being used. Particular areas being investigated include the trend analyses of ozone and precursor concentrations (chemical species associated with the formation and control of ozone) over the last 100 years in relation to changes in emissions. The shape, form and variability of seasonal cycles of ozone and its precursors, a proxy for changing atmospheric composition will be determined. The interrelationships of photochemistry, emissions, atmospheric circulation and land-use in controlling ozone and precursor trends/seasonal cycles will also be evaluated. The role and sensitivity of photochemistry to changing atmospheric composition will be addressed. In order to investigate the aspects of the controllable ozone problem, data taken from national and European monitoring networks are being coupled to intensive field data and models to build an integrated picture of the factors affecting the control of ozone and its precursors over Europe. Detailed and focussed analysis of the data is leading to a clear picture of the effectiveness of EU and national pollution abatement strategies and could lead to more effective monitoring strategies for atmospheric composition over Europe. To date, many of the EU and national abatement strategies have been formulated mainly on the basis of models. TROTREP is providing a careful observational verification of pollution abatement strategies to verify and supplement this approach in a holistic manner. Expected impacts The major impacts of this work will be a quantitative analysis of the proportion of ozone in Europe controllable by further emission reductions coupled to the development of a policy instrument to evaluate the success of emission reduction measures taken in the framework of EU policy.",1,0
389,205171,No,AMBER - enhAnced Mobile BiomEtRics,"Over recent years the ubiquity of mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets devices has rapidly increased. These devices provide a range of untethered interaction unimaginable a decade previously. With this ability to interact with services and individuals comes the need to accurately authenticate the identity of the person requesting the transaction many of which carry financial/legally-binding instruction. Biometric solutions have also seen increased prominence over the past decade with large-scale implementations in areas such as passport and national ID systems. The adoption of specific biometric sensors by mobile vendors indicates a long-term strategy as a means of authentication. This adoption is is at critical point – users need to be confident of biometrics in terms of usability, privacy and performance; compromise in any one of these categories will lead to mistrust and a reluctance to adopt over and above conventional forms of authentication. The design, implementation and assessment of biometrics on mobile devices therefore requires a range of solutions to aid initial and continued adoption. The EU needs to have experts trained specifically in the field to ensure that it participates, competes and succeeds in the global market.   AMBER comprises 11 partners with recognised expertise from across the EU. The specific objectives are to:  • Address a range of current issues facing biometric solutions on mobile devices requiring timely research and development. • Collate Europe-wide complementary expertise to investigate these issues and provide a structure and environment to effectively facilitate training. • Train and equip the next generation of researchers to define, investigate and implement solutions, and provide transferable skills to enable effective planning, management and communication of research ideas and outcomes. • Develop solutions and theory to ensure secure, ubiquitous and efficient authentication whilst protecting privacy of citizen.",0,0

After a pre-phase connected with an internal kick-off meeting, the first phase analyses policy instruments, measures and actions and the gained experiences in WP 2 'Basic' instrumental overview'. The instrumental overview is intended to be of a broader nature to collect insights into existing, but also discussed, proposed and/or rejected tools which have lead or could lead to a greening of the markets by addressing supply and/or demand.

109,111009,Yes,Regional climate-air quality interactions,"'Air quality is strongly dependent on weather and is therefore sensitive to climate variability and climate change. On the other hand, air pollution affects the atmospheric composition which in turn affects the earth's radiative budget and the earth's climate. Hence the climate and the air quality are intimately interactive parts of the earth's system and the feedbacks between them can act to amplify or dampen climate sensitivity. These complex interactions are not well understood but are critical to the behavior of the system as a whole and should be taken into consideration into the design of effective policies. The REQUA project aims at strengthening the research partnership through staff exchanges and networking activities between research groups in Europe, USA and China working in the field of regional climate-air quality interactions. The general scientific goal is to advance the current understanding of interactions between different components of the earth system. The project will be based on two regional chemistry-climate models, one developed in USA and one in Europe: (i) WRF-CMAQ, a well established online modeling system, and (ii) RegCM-CHEM, an integrated regional climate model with a reduced chemical scheme. The consortium consists of a team of 8 partners, namely 4 EU research teams (from Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and UK) and 4 from third countries (USA and China). All participants have extensive experience in different aspects of air quality/climate interactions, combining different aspects expressed by different skills, tools and equipment. Most of the partners have already developed some collaboration, however the consortium is novel. The planned activities include joint research work, workshops, training courses and seminars. All activities are designed to exploit complementary expertise of the participants and to create synergies between them. They are also planned to create additional benefits for the participants in terms of transfer of knowledge.'",0,1
539,209826,No,French-English bilinguals' processing of morphosyntactic structures: the case of cross-linguistic transfer,"One question central to both bilingual first language acquisition (2L1) and second language development (L2) research is to understand the mechanisms that lead to systematic interaction between the languages, i.e. cross-linguistic influence (CLI). To-date, we know that bilinguals’ two languages are continuously co-activated to some extent at the lexicon and sentence level. Bilinguals need to map different syntactic forms, i.e. one or more for each language, onto the same discourse function, which occasionally leads to the entrenchment of the non-targetlike form. Yet, little is known about how the age of acquisition (2L1 vs. L2) and language dominance (expressive abilities, language exposure) affect the processing mechanisms governing this phenomenon.  This project focuses on an aspect of morphosyntactic development (the article system) known to be particularly challenging for both bilingual children and adults. It adopts a unique comparative approach to investigate whether simultaneous French-English bilingual children’s and L2 adult bilinguals’ sentence comprehension is affected by the parallel activation of the article system in specific and generic contexts in two studies using the self-paced moving window method. French is a very restrictive language and requires the projection of a determiner in argument position. In contrast, English allows bare mass nouns and bare plural nouns in non-specific and generic contexts. These cross-linguistic differences will allow us to test (i) whether the co-activation of distinct morphosyntactic forms (article system) depending on the semantic context (specific vs. generic) leads to language interference in French-English bilinguals’ comprehension of sentence structure; (ii) the role of language exposure vs. productive measures of the relative language dominance on the direction and magnitude of cross-linguistic transfers; (iii) to what extent this phenomenon operates differently depending on the age of language acquisition.",0,0

Diagnosis require extracting tissue samples via invasive and expensive biopsy, followed by laboratory analysis, which are subject to significant levels of discordance.   SDS Optic presents a revolutionary opto-biological methodology that allows for instant cellular processes studies including in-vivo cancer diagnosis with single-cell resolution. SDS-OmiProbe detects presence and measures concentration levels of the HER2\ cancer cells in breast tumours.

It is particularly prevalent among elderly and obese cohorts and is a lifelong disease, with acute and chronic health impacts. It is linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and associated with increased risk of heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, daytime sleepiness, depression and poor neurocognitive performance. Estimated annual economic costs of the disease are €60-150b. Established therapeutic options are uncomfortable with unpleasant side effects and/or ineffective; they can also require invasive surgery. Compliance is a major problem with the first line treatment, CPAP: 50% of users refuse it outright or fail to continue use after 1 year. Nyxoah's disruptive neurostimulation device responds directly to these needs and drawbacks. Central to the system is a tiny device implanted under the chin that - compared to other neurostimulator implantations - is smaller, less invasive and has lower risk of infection. The device is powered wirelessly by an activation chip, which is attached to a disposable smart patch and stuck under the chin before sleep. No mask, no noisy machine, no unpleasant side effects. The chip has a closed feedback loop with the implant, which detects tissue resistance and tells the chip to adjust the pulse to keep constant pressure on the nerve, to avoid burnout; it also communicates wirelessly with an app, which displays useful information (synced with the cloud) for use by patients, physicians and social security agencies; this is a key development to allow treatment compliance monitoring and therefore for reimbursement.

Despite its established clinical relevance, the pathogenicity of this nosocomial superbug is poorly understood. The biphasic amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii is a cellular infection model broadly used to decipher the virulence mechanisms of human pathogens, as bacterial resistance upon amoebal predation (grazing) are often correlated with their pathogenicity potential in human. However, high-throughput screening approaches to investigate the virulence mechanisms of A. baumannii using this amoeba in an infection context are still lacking. This project aims at applying original large-scale screening approaches to identify A. baumannii virulence factors using the amoeba A. castellanii as host-pathogen system. The proposed experimental set up allows monitoring the outcome of the bacteria-amoebae interactions in qualitative and quantitative manners, at both population and single cell levels. Virulence induction of A. baumannii, as well as the use of successful clinical isolates will be tested using several complementary grazing assays. Precise localization of A. baumannii reporter strains will be done on both trophozoite and cyst stages of A. castellanii, complemented with (i) real-time and live-cell fluorescence imaging as well as (ii) electron microscopy techniques. Viability assays for both bacteria and amoebae will be done to understand the symbiotic outcome of this interaction. The global resistance potential of A. baumannii will be assessed by (i) Tn-seq analysis and (ii) high-throughput screen of individual mutant strains, followed by in depth mechanistic studies on validated attenuated strains. This project will shed light on the yet unknown global virulence mechanisms of A. baumannii by generating original screening methods using A. castellanii as an infection cellular model.",0,0
107,98983,Yes,Chilean Lake sediments as archives for climate variability during the past 1000 years,"'Currently much effort is put into answering the question: ‘Does the magnitude and rate of 20th Century climate change exceed natural variability over the last millennium? This is important since it provides information on the influence of e.g. anthropogenic forcing of climate, which is highly relevant for the general public and policy makers. However, climatic reconstructions of a sufficient quality and resolution are very scarce in the Southern Hemisphere. In addition, most climatic proxies are biased towards the warm growing season; reconstructions for the winter season are typically scarce. Recent studies have highlighted though that the amplitude and direction of climate change differs for each season. In addition, it is mostly the seasonal (or shorter) climatic events which have greater environmental and socio-economic impacts. Therefore there is a particularly strong need for data representing seasonally resolved temperature variability for the Southern Hemisphere. This project aims to develop high-resolution, quantitative reconstructions of summer and winter temperature variability in the Chilean Andes during the past 1000 years based on novel methods; chrysophyte stomatocyst analysis and scanning in-situ reflectance spectrometry. These records will be used to put recent climatic changes in a long-term context, study changes in seasonal contrasts/extremes and to study forcing factors in the greater study area by comparison to GCM ensemble runs. The basic costs of the CHILE1000 project are covered by a prestigious grant obtained by the applicant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (covering the applicant’s salary and a contribution to other project costs). The ERG grant will form an essential contribution to the applicant’s career since it allows carrying out all required fieldwork and analysis and will greatly enhance the applicant’s visibility and independence in a novel, promising field of research.'",1,1
399,73382,No,Cytochrome c biogenesis in higher plant mitochondria,"Abstract: The research program aims at studying a mechanism specific of land plant mitochondria: the biogenesis of c type cytochromes. This mechanism taking place in the mitochondria inter membrane space is performed by a multi-submits protein complex composed of subunits encoded in both the nuclear and the mitochondria genome. The first goal of the research will be to purify this complex and to characterise its subunits. This project also fits in the wider problematic of gene expression coordination between the nucleus and mitochondria. This study was initiated during the post-doctoral training course financed by a Marie Curie fellowship. The particular case of the cytochrome assembly complex and its relation with the rest of the plant cell will preferentially be used as a model during this study. The study of cytochrome c biogenesis is also very interesting in the context of the recent discovery of the involvement of cytochrome c in the triggering of programmed cell death (PCD). It is possible that this metabolism could act as a regulator in some PCD mechanisms involving cytochrome c. DNAmicroarray technology will be used to investigate the expression regulations of cytochrome c biogenesis genes and the relations of this mechanism with other mechanisms in the plant cell, particularly PCD. This research project, with its purpose of answering precise biological questions, will use biochemicals well as genetic techniques. It will also allow the implementation and adaptation of advanced technologies in the laboratory of origin, in particular polemics and DNA micro arrays, to the research field of plant mitochondria.",0,0
904,208830,No,Novel application targets and products derived from wild arctic berries,"Novel application targets and products derived from wild arctic berries (WILDBERRY)  The demand for nutraceuticals and functional foods is on the rise due to increased consumer interest in convenient, safe and healthy foods. One of the solutions to meet this demand are wild arctic berries, many of which contain significant amounts of anthocyanins. Anthocyanins act as antioxidants and are known for their beneficial effect to cardiovascular health, vision and prevention of diabetes, among other benefits. We (Extrx Oy) are a company established in 2016 with aim to produce high quality anthocyanin extract, alongside with other novel products, from local berries. We are located in Sotkamo, Finland, in the area where anthocyanin concentrations of bilberries have been scientifically shown to be highest in the world. With the significant resources of wild berries available, our focus on high quality and our contacts abroad give us a good chance to be successful and in the forefront of the industry in the future. Project focus will be on adsorption chromatography process and product development as a part of the company's R&D team. Although the process itself is straightforward, there are still areas where novel ideas are needed to enhance the cost-efficiency of the process and economical potential of the products. These are  1) potential uses for the solid berry fraction, 2) potential uses for the sugar fraction and  3) anthocyanin extraction process optimization.  For the applicant we are offering the opportunity to further their skills and conduct interesting research while working at a company with great ideas and prospects for the future. The aim is to use the findings of the project to improve the process and to deliver new products to global market, as well as to either patent or publish the novel findings.",0,0

The overall aim of the project is to create a DIH widening network that supports the collaboration of new DIHs (proto-hubs) in regions where SAE and I4MS technologies are underrepresented and well-established DIHs that are highly experienced in these technologies (mature hubs). BOWI takes the first step towards creating a fully sustainable post-project network by: 1. Strengthening proto-hubs by carrying out actual experiments and facilitating the collaboration between proto-hubs and mature hubs; 2. Ensuring sustainability of BOWI network by developing a blended financing accelerator and membership model; 3. Creating the BOWI community, initiating the participation of proto-hubs, mature hubs, regional stakeholders, and investors. The mechanism will be first tested by supporting 6 pioneer proto-hubs (pioneer stage), which will be later extended to 9 proto-hubs in the second full-fledged strengthening stage, allowing new members of the EU DIH community to participate, including the proto-hubs and mature hubs that are currently not part of the consortium. The post-project BOWI network business model is to be explored, including service and funding needs. To ensure practical experience, all 15 proto-hubs will be supported to conduct 60 (15x4) SAE/I4MS uptake experiments with SMEs in total. For this purpose, an extensive FSTP approach will be used. The consortium includes experienced partners that participate intensively in the SAE/I4MS strategies (Civitta, FBA, VTT, and RWTH). They are complemented by 6 proto-hubs from various countries that act as pioneer hubs to test and validate approaches (TIT, LITC, UWB, KTP, NTNU, ICT).",0,0
941,51007,No,VOC-FUEL (VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS USED AS FUEL ONBOARD OIL TANKERS),"VOC-fuel will provide utilisation of energy which today is wasted into the atmosphere and causing a serious environmental problem. The objectives are :  a) To develop a prototype system for recovering and condensing hydrocarbon gas (VOC) emitted from the oil cargo during loading and transit and to use VOC-condensate as replacement of conventional fuel for the vessel propulsion engines.  b) To build a sufficient experience from such a prototype system to be able to decide implementation of a first-generation commercial system on several ships.  c) To verify and document the potentials of reductions of VOC-emission, heavy fuel oil consumption and the related exhaust gas emission. Use of condensate (VOC) as engine fuel is verified through engine tests in Copenhagen. 1. Innovative technology of the project : Instead of emitting substantial amount of VOC vapour to the atmosphere during loading of crude oil, it is condensed, stored and injected as additional fuel to the ship propulsion engines.Up to approx.95% of the energy can be supplied from the VOC whereas the rest is supplied from HFO (Heavy fuel oil) or diesel oil required for the ignition of the VOC gas. The engines are able to operate on any combination of HFO and VOC in dual fuel or in single fuel (diesel) mode. 2. The context in which the technology is operating : The project shall result in a working VOC-fuel demo processing plant at full scale based on condensation. The VOC-fuel shall be used for dual fuel combustion in one of the two MAN B&W diesel engine installed onboard a Statoil buoy-loading crude oil carrier operating in the North Sea. The system's performance during operation shall be monitored. 3. Economic aspects of the technology i.e. overcost compared to conventional equipment, cost of energy produced if appropriate : A reduction of 95% of the fuel oil consumption for a North Sea shuttle tanker can be obtained. HFO expenses amounts to about 30% of total operating expenses on a tanker. Environmental considerations are the real objection for this project, but due to the potential energy savings, it may be possible to have a good payback on the investment dependant upon the siling route of the ship and how much VOC can be trapped and utilised. 4. Monitoring if of particular note : Operating experiences and recorded data shall give a firm basis for deciding if a broad implementation shall take place for VOC-fuel systems on crude oil carriers.",0,0
977,93448,No,Exploring the dark matter of the human brain transcriptome: The origin and function of long non-coding RNAs,"Genome-wide transcription maps of different model species [1-5] reveal an unforeseen number of transcribed DNA segments lacking protein-coding potential [1, 2, 4, 5]. These non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are frequently expressed in the brain [6] and, although generally acknowledged as functionally relevant, the biological role of most long ncRNAs remains unclear mainly due to the lack of prediction tools and testable hypotheses. Recent work in the host institution indicates that some brain-expressed ncRNAs regulate the transcription of adjacent protein-coding genes thus providing a criterion to target long ncRNA for further characterization (Ponjavic, J. et al submitted). We propose to compile and analyze a catalog of human long ncRNAs and use it to understand when and how these transcripts emerged during evolution. Using a combination of in silico and in vitro experiments we will identify and functionally characterize long ncRNAs in the human genome, and test the recent hypothesis that some of these transcripts are involved in the transcriptional regulation of their adjacent protein-coding genes. We will particularly focus on transcripts that are specific to primates, as these are more likely to contribute to recently emerged features of the human brain including their relative increase in brain size and complexity. The proposed identification and functional characterization of young brain-expressed ncRNAs is timely and combines the applicant’s expertises in protein-coding gene evolution and the computational and ncRNA competences available in the host institution.",0,0

113,94748,Yes,Predicting eutrophication and climate change impacts on shallow lake ecology and biodiversity: disentangling the effects of temperature and nutrients,"Increased nutrient concentrations in freshwater ecosystems have had profound impacts on their biodiversity, perhaps none more so than in shallow lakes. It may be that impacted systems such as these are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Increasing temperature and eutrophication are not only linked, but their impacts are similar and thus it has proven very difficult to disentangle their effects. It may be that analysis of rate of change may elucidate the effects of climate change and nutrient enrichment on shallow lake biodiversity, species turnover and ecosystem function. PRECISE seeks to determine the extent and rate of change in shallow lake biodiversity and ecosystem function resulting from eutrophication and climate change. To do this a longer-term perspective is vital, PRECISE consists of three approaches which encompass distinct combinations of climate and nutrient effects at a range of temporal scales. These are: large-scale mesocosm experiment; contemporary time series analysis; and palaeolimnogical analysis. The overarching aim is the determination of the effect of temperature and nutrient concentration on the extent and rate of change in the balance of benthic to pelagic production and biodiversity. This will be achieved by complementing on-going research generating biodiversity data with both direct measurement of algal crop (benthic and pelagic) and the determination of pathways of production by the analysis of stable isotopes. This will be done both in the mesocosm experiment (nutrient and temperature separate) and through time series analysis of observational data (temperature and nutrient together). A meta-analysis of an existing data from sediment cores will compare contemporary change (nutrients and climate together) with change associated with a rapid increase in temperature after the 8.2K cooling (climate alone). These integrated analyses will elucidate on unique climate and nutrient impacts on shallow lake biodiversity and function.",1,1

The integrated improved cabin ADS is one of the key contributors to the environmental challenge of the ITD Airframe activities in reducing the structural weight by 4% to 6%, the CO2 and NOx, footprint by 3% to 5%, while enhancing passenger comfort by reducing noise and vibration. NADiA will significantly improve the ADS by 15% in weight, 3dB in acoustic and 20% in cost.  Development, manufacturing costs and assembly times will be reduced, and production rates will be increased. To achieve the overall goals, ‘beyond state of the art’ technologies will be developed and verified in dedicated tests up to TRL6.  The key end goal of NADiA will be to fully integrate and test the novel ADS in the cabin demonstrator located at Fraunhofer IBP in Holzkirchen (Topic Manager), as well as to provide support for the Environmental Control System (ECS) testing performed by Fraunhofer IBP.

177,102957,No,Molecular and cellular imaging of membrane interactions in pathogen attack and immune defense,"'The immune system and pathogens both use membrane pore-forming proteins to penetrate cellular membranes, in order to kill target cells or to allow passage of pathogenic organisms such as malaria parasites, listeria, or toxoplasma. For both fundamental and practical reasons, it is important to understand the biological actions of the 'arms race' underlying virulence, pathogenesis and immune defense. The key weapon in this membrane attack is a class of proteins that upon activation undergo a dramatic conversion from water-soluble monomers to a large, membrane-inserted assembly. Both the human immune response and microbial pathogenesis rely on membrane disruption by perforin-like proteins for attack and counterattack. This protein superfamily encompasses perforin and complement pore-forming assemblies in the immune system, as well as the more distantly related bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. With recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy, tomography and correlative fluorescence microscopy, it is now possible to relate the workings of protein machines in model systems such as liposomes to their actions in the cellular context. I wish to capitalize on these technical advances and visualize membrane interactions at the moment the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii bursts out of its host cell, as well as the delivery of lethal cargo from the cytotoxic lymphocyte to its target cell through the immune synapse. These studies will correlate 3D spatial information at cellular and molecular levels to reveal the operation of dynamic cellular machinery. I have chosen a well-ordered system that can bridge the gulf between cell biology and atomic structure. Innovations in sample preparation combined with state-of the art imaging methods will lead to the molecular definition of a fundamental process in “hostile” communication between cells and will broaden the landscape for drug design for immune disorders and major infectious diseases.'",0,0
294,214090,No,Quantum speed limits in thermodynamic processes and coherent control,"Recent years have seen remarkable strides taken in the understanding, simulation, and control of complex quantum systems, evidenced by the fact that so-called second generation quantum technologies are becoming viable and a global concerted effort to exploit quantum systems is steadily progressing. To maximise the potential of these emerging technologies we must both understand their underlying working principles and be able to manipulate them effectively. In regards to the former, the quickly growing field of quantum thermodynamics is, and continues to, develop the basic framework to understand work, heat, and efficiency when quantum systems are used. Regarding the latter, a plethora of techniques to control quantum systems have come to the forefront of research, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. From a practical standpoint we normally seek to achieve this control in the shortest possible time. In this regard, one of the most intriguing aspects of quantum systems emerged from the clarification of Heisenberg’s energy-time uncertainty relation when Mandelstam and Tamm showed that it sets a minimal time for a quantum system to evolve: the quantum speed limit time.  The main goal of the proposed action will be to exploit the recent developments in understanding the thermodynamics of quantum systems in order to develop control techniques for complex quantum systems that operate as quickly as physically possible, while requiring the minimal resources. This will be achieved by establishing connections between the quantum speed limit and other fundamental bounds, determining the achievability of the quantum speed limit using state-of-the-art control techniques, and designing new protocols that require minimal experimental resources, yet achieve a desired task.",0,0
48,193233,Yes,Ultra Low emission Technology Innovations for Mid-century Aircraft Turbine Engines,"With the ULTIMATE project five experienced research groups and four major European engine manufacturers will develop innovative propulsion systems to fulfill the SRIA 2050 key challenges. One of the most challenging targets is the 75% reduction in energy consumption and CO2-emissions. Technologies currently at TRL 3-5, cannot achieve this aim. It is estimated that around a 30% reduction must come from radical innovations now being at lower TRL. Thus, European industry needs synergetic breakthrough technologies for every part of the air transport system, including the airframe, propulsion and power.   The ULTIMATE project singles out the major loss sources in a state of the art turbofan (combustor irreversibility, core exhaust heat, bypass exhaust kinetic energy). These are then used to categorize breakthrough technologies (e.g. piston topping, intercooling & exhaust heat exchangers, and advanced propulsor & integration concepts). This classification approach gives a structured way to combine and explore synergies between the technologies in the search for ultralow CO2, NOx and noise emissions. The most promising combinations of radical technologies will then be developed for a short range European and a long range intercontinental advanced tube and wing aircraft.  Through the EU projects VITAL, NEWAC, DREAM, LEMCOTEC, E-BREAK and ENOVAL, the ULTIMATE partners have gained the most comprehensive experience in Europe on conception and evaluation of advanced aero engine architectures. Existing tools, knowledge and models will be used to perform optimization and evaluation against the SRIA targets to mature the technologies to TRL 2. Road maps will be set up to outline the steps to develop the technologies into products and bring them onto the market. These road maps will also provide a way forward for future European propulsion and aviation research.",0,1
275,188053,No,The role of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers in replication stress,"Accurate DNA replication is an essential prerequisite of genome stability, and nature has evolved numerous mechanisms to ensure precise and complete genome duplication. Subversion of these protective mechanism results in genome instability, the hallmark of cancer and many human developmental syndromes. Paradoxically, recent evidence suggests that pharmacological interference with these mechanisms represents a promising therapeutic strategy, because cancer cells show a pronounced dependency on these pathways for their survival. One of the most important requirements for faithful DNA replication is the maintenance of replication fork stability under conditions of stress. A number of proteins involved in this process have been identified to date; however, our understanding about their post-translational regulation is rather vague. In particular, although their indispensable role in DNA damage signaling is firmly established, the role of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers responding to DNA replication stress has so far not been addressed. We propose to combine high-content microscopy with reverse genetics to identify ubitiqutin-related factors and pathways in the response to DNA replication stress. To this end, we will set up a dual labeling protocol for the quantitative detection of DNA synthesis – an approach never exploited for high content studies. To realize the full potential of this approach, comprehensive expertise in high-content microscopy and RNAi based screens are essential – both of which are among the core competencies of the host institution. We will characterize novel regulators by a combination of basic and highly specialized, biochemical, molecular and cellular biology and physicochemical techniques. We are confident that the results of this study will reveal novel aspects of DNA replication and genome surveillance and their role in human disease, and provide new opportunities for cancer therapy.",0,0
995,82898,No,Enhancement of motor learning by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) after chronic stroke,"Chronic motor disability, present in two thirds of stroke survivors pose tremendous personal and social burden. There is no universally accepted treatment for motor disability resulting from stroke. Recent studies demonstrated that rehabilitative training can improve motor function and relearning after stroke. However, these approaches lead only to partial amelioration.  It is crucial to develop novel strategies to enhance functional recovery after stroke. It has been proposed that cortical stimulation can enhance brain plasticity. New understanding of mechanisms of plasticity led to the preliminary finding that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive cortical stimulation, can safely enhance motor performance of the paretic hand in patients with chronic subcortical stroke.  These findings suggest that tDCS, in association with motor training and through Hebbian principles, could enhance recovery processes. The two main hypotheses of this proposal are - that tDCS can improve performance/learning of a finger motor sequence by the paretic hand after both subcortical and cortical stroke relative to sham; and - that the mechanisms and neural substrates underlying this effect will include reorganisation within ipsilesional primary motor and premotor cortices.  During the outgoing phase, anodal tDCS and sham will be applied in chronic stroke patients over the motor cortex, in synchrony with motor training consisting of performance of finger motor sequences in a double blind, sham control led experimental design.  Endpoint measures of the study will be - performance of newly learned motor sequences, - reorganisational changes in motor and premotor cortices identified by functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation associated with the sequence learning processes.  During the return phase, tDCS will be applied - to patients in the subacute stroke stage and - during rehabilitation training.",0,0

The competition is increasing in this area both for the full launching systems and the key subsystems. Cost-effectiveness becomes the main driving factor. HYPROGEO ambition is to study a propulsion module based on Hybrid chemical propulsion. Hybrid propulsion is not a new technology but its application to a transfer module or to a re-ignitable upper stage is very innovative. It is an interesting alternative for the GEO transfer, between the chemical propulsion (bi-liquid) and the new trend of Electrical Propulsion (EP).  There are very good synergies and complementarities with the other propulsion activities. The proof of concept (specific impulse, thrust) has been demonstrated. The main technical challenge is the long duration firings. The future development of an operational system, already identified in the current roadmaps, requires advanced R&D work on 4 critical technologies: - Combustion chamber. - High endurance nozzle. - Catalytic injector. - Production, storage and use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.  These R&D activities structure 4 main work packages. A system study ensures the global vision in coherence with an economic analysis, the identification of technical challenges and the consolidation of scientific results. A last work package performs the dissemination of results. An innovative aspect is the fact that the R&D activities are directly driven by the ecvolution of market needs and system requirements. Main expected benefits are: - Green and simpler design (compared to bi-liquid). - Shorter transfer time and reduced cost of operations (compared to EP)  A TRL 3-4 level is expected at the end of the project.

Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrests remain are highly lethal, with 9 out of 10 of the 350,000 EU cases ending in death. When a person’s heart stops, fast response is needed. Many times, fluid such as vomit clog up a person’s airway during a cardiac arrest, and so it is standard practice for ambulances to carry suction devices to clear airways. Prompt airway clearing can increase survivability in trauma cases by as much as 10%, yet current portable suction devices are not designed with a paramedic-centric view. Instead, they are heavy, bulky, difficult and time consuming to use, requiring both hands for operation and extensive cleaning afterwards. Resultantly, paramedics do not carry them to the scene at first response, thereby compromising the patients’ lives.  Having worked for the world’s largest supplier of emergency care pre-hospital medical devices for decades, we were disappointed by the lack of innovation and user-centric design. We imagined a scenario were paramedics would enjoy using portable suction devices. After widely consulting with paramedics, physicians and Emergency Services operators, we created a completely new handheld design applying advanced mechatronics to deliver a suction device that is 85% lighter than current products whilst achieving the required life-saving performance.  We have received the support of the largest private ambulance providers in Europe and the US and are currently creating a global distribution network. The market for medical suction devices is growing to just under €1bn by 2024 with one of the key drivers being the demand for compact portable medical devices.

GHG (mainly carbon dioxide) emissions and removals in forests considerably vary from one region to another due to the different forests characteristics (bioclimatic zones, plant type, age, soil type, etc.). Spatial inventory of emissions and sinks in forestry at local scale significantly reduces uncertainty in inventory results. The proposal comprises the advantages of using spatial approaches to analyze emissions/removals of carbon dioxide in forestry at different spatial levels (from individual to national forest land). The georeferred integrated forest carbon accounting system will be based on mathematical models of forest carbon account and emissions/removals in forestry and information system for the analysis of scenarios of emissions/removals for various commercial demands for wood, energy and international measures to reduce emissions. It will contain a database of forest parameters, including geographic information to communicate with digital maps, models of carbon balance and algorithms for automatic estimation of forest parameters and a convenient user interface.

Despite good progress, it is still difficult to create a stable renewable energy generation mix, and to provide solutions that can reach all locations and communities in Europe, including remote communities. Significant parts of rivers worldwide remain an untapped energy resource, due to the lack of appropriate technology for hydro power extraction from remote/environmentally sensitive locations, or those with low-head, current velocity, or depth. Eel Energy, a French hydrotech startup, has developed a 1MW tidal energy converter based on biomimetic principles. Eel’s solution is an undulating membrane producing energy via linear converters, which significantly outperforms turbine-based technology in terms of simplicity, reliability, efficiency and environmental footprint. Eel Energy is now developing the ELVER (baby eel), a small (80kW), riverine-adapted version of their tidal generator. Compared with standard turbine solutions, ELVER will be able to reach higher efficiency and reliability, operate at lower heads and current velocities, and require far less civil works: reducing installation, operations costs, and environmental impact of installation. This technology has an unprecedented range of potential installation sites, and can play an important part in the sustainability of rural/remote communities. ELVER allows the development of new hydrokinetic resources, in both mature markets, and the developing world.

The multidisciplinary PICCOLO team proposes a new compact, hybrid and multimodal photonics endoscope based on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multi-Photon Tomography (MPT) combined with novel red-flag fluorescence technology for in vivo diagnosis and clinical decision support. By combining the outstanding structural information from OCT with the precise functional information from MPT, this innovative endoscope will provide gastroenterologists immediate and detailed in situ identification of colorectal neoplastic lesions and facilitate accurate and reliable in vivo diagnostics, with additional, grading capabilities for colon cancer as well as in-situ lesion infiltration and margin assessment. With the development of compact instrumentation, the cost of the components and thus the system will be significantly reduced. Human representative animal models will be used to generate imaging biomarkers that allow automated detection, assessment and grading of disease. The developed system will be tested in operating room conditions.  The consortium comprises the whole value chain including pre-clinical and clinical partners, technology providers, photonics SMEs and endoscopy market leader company. The project will permit these companies to enhance their competitiveness and leadership in the diagnostics sector as well as exploiting new market opportunities. The new endoscope will significantly impact clinical practice allowing in vivo optical biopsy assessment via the automatic analysis of images allowing accurate and efficient characterisation of colorectal lesions.",0,0
920,4682,No,The impact of NOx emissions from aircraft upon the atmosphere at flight altitude 8-15 km,"The objective of this project is to determine the emissions of NOX from aircraft engines and global air traffic at cruising altitudes, the resultant increase in NOX concentrations, and the effects on the composition of the atmosphere, in particular with respect to ozone formation in the upper troposphere.  A set of values for the effluent temperatures and concentrations at the exhaust of an engine has been established, in order to start the hot jet modelling. The work is then interactive between the different phases of the models. The first phase concentrates on the near field and the expansion of the hot jet. Preliminary results of the instantaneous values of the parameters along the first 25 meters are obtained with a simplified reaction scheme. The second phase looks at the mixing between the jet and the vortex. The adaptive grid algorithm has been developed and tested on a 2-dimensional test case for which it performs very well. Possible transformations along the wake, from short to long lifetime and from hot to cold temperatures are investigated. Preliminary measurements using gas chromatography corroborate the hypothesis that gas solid interaction may play an important role in the wake of an aircraft. A preliminary 3-dimensional database of nitrogen oxide emissions from aircraft has been provided. With this 3-dimensional input data transport simulations were performed with a spectral general circulation model with parameterizations of radiation, cloud formation and precipitation, convection, and vertical and horizontal diffusion. A similar numerical experiment was performed using a transport model including convection. The results of both models are qualitatively similar. The flight emissions also served as input for a 2-dimensional transport model with a simplified nitrogen oxide chemistry which was used to study the impact of aircraft emissions on the ozone concentration. First results have been obtained with respect to the dynamics of the jet flow and heterogeneous reactions on soot particles. Numerical simulations indicate large temperature fluctuations in the jet flow with possibly strong importance for the chemistry. Considerable progress has been made in developing global transport and circulation models including simple chemical cycles for both the tropo sphere and the stratosphere.  The AERONOX project investigated the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from aircraft engines and global air traffic at cruising altitudes, the resultant increase in NOx concentrations, and the effects on the composition of the atmosphere, in particular with respect to ozone formation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The project was structured into three subprojects: engine exhaust emissions; physics and chemistry in the aircraft wake; global atmospheric model simulations. A complementary programme of work by aviation experts has provided detailed information on air traffic data which was combined with data on aircraft performance and emissions to produce a global emissions inventory.  The work resulted in improved predictive equations to determine NOx emissions at cruise conditions based on available data for aircraft/engine combinations and NOx emission measurements on two engines in cruise conditions. This information was combined with traffic database to provide a new global NOx emissions inventory. It was found that only minor chemical cahnges occur during the vortex regime of the emission plume. However this result does not exclude the possibility of furthur changes in the dispersion phase. A variey of global models was set up to investigate the changes in NOx concentrations and photochemistry. Although aviation contributes only a small proportion (about 3%) of the total global NOx from all anthropogenic sources, the models show that aviation contributes a large fraction to the concentrations of NOx in the upper troposphere, in particular north of 30 degrees north.  For the analysis of the impact of aircraft emissions on the chemical composition of the troposphere, a 2-dimensional model was developed to describe photochemistry and transport processes in the upper troposphere at northern mid latitudes. The model included a simplified chemistry of nitrogen oxides and nitric acid and transport of trace species by advection, vertical eddy diffusion and convection. The nitrogen oxide sources considered were emissions at the Earth's surface, lightning, input from the stratosphere and aircraft emissions. The model when applied to the latitude band of 40 to 50 degrees north indicated an increase of nitrogen oxide in the upper troposphere on the order of 30 to 40% due to aircraft emissions. These calculations showed also the importance of fast vertical transport, for example, by deep convection for the budget of nitrogen oxides in the upper troposphere. To examine the change of concentration of ozone and hydroxyl radicals induced by aircraft emissions, reactions of hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxy radicals (HO2), ozone, carbon monoxide and methane were included in the model. The calculations for the latitude band 40 to 50 degrees north showed a summertime increase of ozone and hydroxyl radical concentrations on the order of 3% and 10% repectively in the upper troposphere as a result of the increase of nitrogen oxides originating from aircraft.  For the study of the heterogenous conversion of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen acids on aerosol surfaces a large aerosol chamber was constructed with a double wall system: aluminium box (outside) and a Teflon-FEP bag (inside) Teflon-FEP is a perifluorinated copolymer of tetrafluorethene and hexafluoropropene. The chamber has a volume of 250 m{3} and a surface/volume ratio of 1 m{-1}. First experiments show half lives of about 21 days for the reactive gases ozone and nitrogen dioxide. The lifetime is limited by wall uptake and diffusion through the FEP walls. These long residence times enable slow reactions on aerosol surfaces to be studied.   The large aerosol chamber with a favorable surface to volume ratio of 1 m{-1} is operational, although clearly in a test phase. Contamination of the aerosol chamber is prevented by the double wall system and the permanent purging of the space between aluminium wall and the FEP bag. The long residence time of inert gases and the long half life of reactive gases are promising for future experiments. Experiments of typically 5 days duration will not be dominated by diffusion through the walls or wall reactions. The project intends to set up a data base for the air traffic emissions. To achieve this, it is foreseen to combine engine emissions, measured and determined within this project, with an air traffic register, which will be established under the coordination of ECAC/ANCAT with DG XI. The influence of these emissions on the atmosphere will be determined by studying the physical & chemical processes within the aircraft wake and by calculating the 3D NOX concentration change with general circulation and chemistry models.  The project is divided into three major subprojects:  1. Engine Exhaust Emissions 2. Physics and Chemistry in the aircraft wake 3. Global atmospheric model simulations  Objective of Subproject 1 is to establish internationally acceptable reference data on aircraft engine emissions throughout the entire flight cycle up to 15 km. This is to be achieved by emission measurements on both engines and combustion rigs at altitude and ground level conditions in order to determine the correction factors, primarily for pressure, temperature, air mass flow and humidity effects. The emissions data will be combined with information on aircraft movements obtained from the air traffic register leading to a 'Flight Emissions Data Base'.  Objective of Subproject 2 is to study the fluid dynamics and the chemical kinetic processes in the wake and to find out the chemical composition of the wake after its size reaches the grid scale of the atmospheric models used in Subproject 3. It is intended to give a description of the gaseous and solid phase of the emissions in the jet and in the vortex regime and to study the mechanisms of interaction between the solid and gaseous phase and to determine the kinetic reaction constants involved in these mechanisms.  Aim of subproject 3 is to determine the three-dimensional NOX concentration change due to emission from aircraft, including both the climatological annual cycle of the concentration change and its long and short variability. Dispersion of airborne NOX will be simulated with two types of models: general circulation models and three-dimensional chemistry models.",0,0

885,100859,No,High Temperature Electronics,"The migration of electronic control units from the engine fan-case to the core would be considered a huge benefit for the engine designer, reducing interconnection complexity and system weight, simplifying assembly and maintenance and providing key nacelle aerodynamic and bypass flow improvements.  However, today’s engine control electronics, typically mounted on the engine fan-case, operates to a maximum temperature in the order of 125 deg C. If the control electronics were to be migrated to the engine core environment, it would be subjected to steady-state temperatures in the order of 2500C, rising to 3000C during transient engine behaviour. In this environment, today’s electronic control units would exhibit inferior performance, reduced reliability and extremely short lifetimes.  The prime aim of the HiTME project is therefore to develop a safety-critical electronic system which can operate reliability when installed in the severe engine core environment. Central to this objective, will be the development, to TRL6, of electronic components and material technologies along with smart thermal and packaging designs that make the concept feasible.  In order to design a product capable of withstanding the high temperatures associated with an engine core installation, whilst still maintaining performance (accuracy) and life, fundamental advancement in key technological areas will be necessary. The following areas are seen as the underpinning building blocks that will ‘enable’ a new generation product that will form the core of the research activity.  •    Component Enhancement (HTSOI, SiC & Passive Components) •    Thermal Design (Cooling Technologies) •    Material Selection (Material Technologies) •    Packaging / Installation Design (Novel Packaging) •    Develop Test Methods (and Analyses)",0,0

The consortium consists of European key organizations from the International Association for Hydrogen Safety HySafe with the relevant background related to LH2 safety research and will be coordinated by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology KIT. The work program duly refers to the outcomes of Research Priorities Workshops commonly organized by IA HySafe, EC JRC, and US DoE. Via HySafe and IEA HIA it will be aligned with other international activities also dedicated to safety issues of LH2, in particular with current research done at Sandia National Laboratory SNL. The results will help to improve the knowledge base and state-of-the-art, which will be reflected in appropriate recommendations for development or revision of specific international standards.  So, the main objectives of PRESLHY are to identify critical knowledge gaps and to close these by developing and validating new appropriate models. Based on these results and with the better understanding of the relevant phenomena, specific engineering correlations will be derived which will help to evaluate mitigation concepts and safety distance rules for LH2 based technologies. The derived models and correlations could be directly implemented in new standards ans/or will fill current gaps in risk assessment tools, like the US supported hydrogen risk assessment toolkit HyRAM, and increase their validated scope of application. In general it will remove over-conservative requirements for innovative solutions, allows for cost-efficient safer design and for internationally harmonised, performance based standards and regulations.

927,195351,No,Geothermal Technology for €conomic Cooling and Heating,"The Drilling technology that is currently used for installation of vertical borehole heat exchangers requires capital-intensive equipment that is expensive to mobilize, leads to deteriorated working conditions and requires experienced teams of specialist operatives. Drilling operations also often require significant quantities of drinking quality water and dispose of dirty water and mud. GEOT€CH will employ a different drilling concept that is based on dry auger methods that requires less capital-intensive equipment, enhances safety and avoids the environmental risks, complexity and costs of dealing with water supplies and contaminated waste. Another key concept of GEOT€CH will be a better integration between heat exchange elements during installation by developing an innovative heat exchanger allowing to achieve high levels of thermal performance with low pressure loss. This device employs a co-axial configuration and spiral fluid flow pathways to achieve low thermal resistance compared to conventional U-tube devices. Furthermore, GEOT€CH aims to implement cost-effective geothermal systems by alleviating the costs associated with drilling boreholes in large size buildings. The GEOT€CH’s approach seeks the maximum use of the foundation structures that are otherwise required, exclusively, for structural and geotechnical purposes in tertiary buildings. Foundation structures such as piles, screen walls and basement slabs will become effective geothermal heat exchangers in GEOT€CH. GEOT€CH will develop optimized hybrid solutions that will integrate the different geothermal systems in small and large buildings market.

124,104259,Yes,Modelling Residential and Transport Energy for Downstream Policies,"'Energy consumption and thus carbon emissions in the domestic sector is responsible for more than 50% of UK carbon emissions (and between one-thirds to one-half in most EU countries) and presents a significant challenge to reducing GHG emissions from  the EU. The overall goal of the proposed 'ModeRATED Policy' project is to understand the impact and distributional burden of downstream policies, especially carbon trading at the personal or household level, in order to mitigate carbon emissions from the domestic sector (personal transport \ in-home) of the economy, through developing an econometric demand model for joint consumption of in-house and transportation energy. The proposed project intends to make contributions to modelling in-house and transportation energy demand through developing an econometric demand model allowing for substitution between the energy consumptions in-house and for transportation needs of the households. Special focus will be on personal carbon trading as a policy to reduce emissions, and incorporation of an additional carbon budget in the theoretical microeconomic demand model. In addition, intermediate to long term trade-offs in energy saving/carbon saving behaviour will be investigated and incorporated in the model. Since there is no existing 'real' world example of carbon capped behaviour, the project will also seek to understand potential behavioural responses through potentially similar real world examples (e.g. vehicle lease for a given cap in km per month). Ultimately, the distribution of burden will be analysed for a carbon tax and a personal carbon trading policy. The results will significantly contribute to the current policy debate on the potential of downstream policies to help reduce carbon emissions from the households and thus reduce overall carbon emissions.'",1,1
858,210278,No,Towards Submarine Landslides and Their Consequences,"The last decade has witnessed a boom in offshore infrastructures, including not only oil and gas platforms and submarine pipelines due to the shift of energy exploration from onshore to offshore but also offshore wind farms, offshore electricity grid infrastructure, and submarine communication cables and routes. This boom significantly enhances the importance of the estimation of potential submarine landslides and their consequences. It is true that submarine landslides may have a unexpectedly long travel distance and damage infrastructure thousands of kilometers away. However numerical modelling of the entire process of submarine landslides is a long-standing challenge. In addition to constitutive models for describing both solid-like and fluid-like behaviour of sediments, it requires also advanced numerical approaches capable of tackling extremely large deformation experienced by materials as well as interactions between structures, seawater, and sediments. This project is motivated by these challenges and aims to develop innovative continuum models and numerical approaches for simulating submarine landslides and their consequences. A unified mixed Lagrangian finite element formulation will be derived for handling solid mechanics (infrastructure), fluid dynamics (seawater), and poromechanics (sediments). Viscoeplastoplastic constitutive models will be developed for capturing the solid-fluid transitional behaviour of sediments. The proposed formulation and models will be implemented on a high performance computing based numerical platform within the framework of the particle finite element method for fully coupled analyses of submarine landslides. The intended outcome is a computational tool that can simulate the complete process of real-world submarine landslides, ranging from the initiation of failure through the sliding process to the final deposition and predicting their impact on offshore infrastructures.",0,0

In this context new Mission and Trajectory Management (MTM) for regional aircraft is recognised to give a significant contribution to reduce environmental impact in term of noise emissions and fuel consumption reduction. New MTM functionalities will be defined through the use of flight simulators for new optimised missions and trajectory evaluation of typical missions taking into account new air traffic management concepts. The SICTA’s consolidated experience in defining the most suitable operational technical solutions in the ATM world will be used to investigate methods supporting change in the trajectories and techniques for providing air traffic management in a GRA simulation environment. Current and future ATM requirements and data will be collected as well as the available regulations and procedures, safety requirements and future expected ATM features.

Special attention will be dedicated to the relevant world wide activities in the field of ATM innovation, to keep in line with possible innovations introduced by SESAR Research and to build on its findings. The evaluation of the MTM requires trials to be performed on the GRA simulation platform. The trials to be performed on the GRA simulation platform will rely on appropriate simulation methodology and the GRA simulation platform will use hypothetical fleet assumptions, consider aircraft operation and regulatory and certification issues, flight safety, air traffic and regional airline requirements.

584,195964,No,NANO-FIBEROUS CATALYSED FILTERS FOR DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSION CONTROL,"Reducing diesel particulate matter (DPM) is a key research area for automotive OEMs in order to meet the more and more stringent emission regulations. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used in separation of carbonatious particles by mechanical filtration and subsequent burning of the DPM in order to avoid pressure drop by filter plugging. Since these materials burn at high temperatures (more than 550°C) with oxygen while diesel exhaust gases temperature lies between 200 and 400°C, a suitable catalytic material is required to promote the soot or DPM combustion. Thus, it is very important to develop suitable catalytic materials which are active enough to ignite the DPM at low temperatures.  This research proposal is aimed to 1) design and develop a nanofibrous structured catalytic material (Pr2O3 and Mn2O3) using a novel synthesis method to have functions of trapping and combustion of DPM, 2) perform detailed characterisation of the nanofibre catalyst, and 3) demonstrate the emission reduction potential of nanofiber catalyst coated DPF by engine testing. The special morphology of nanofiber structure catalysts will increase the contact point of the DPM and help in burning of the soot. Thus the catalysed DPF can reduce the exhaust particulate emissions and exhaust back pressure there by improving the engine performance as well. These will be demonstrated in running a legislative emission driving cycle on a transient dynamometer engine test facility at the University of Birmingham (UoB). The experienced researcher will bring a new research area in the development of nanofiberous catalyst for DPF to the UoB and the latest advancements in engine testing and emission measurement techniques in the Future Engine and Fuels group will be transferred to the experienced researcher as part of the knowledge transfer.

172,73063,No,Singularities near a moving contact line: from sliding drops to avalanches,"The goal of this project is to theoretically study the singularities near the moving contact line of a sliding droplet in relation to the problem of avalanche fronts in granular media. A droplet flowing down a window displays fascinating behaviours; involving bifurcations between singular shapes drop emission and coalescence, which have only recently been characterized experimentally. To describe these phenomena theoretically, one has to overcome a fundamental problem: In classical hydrodynamics the flow naiad moving contact line develops infinite stress and energy dissipation. It remains highly disputed how to couple the microscopes near the contact line to the large-scale dynamics of the drop. Though this has remained scarcely noticed up to now, the same singularity occurs at the tip of an avalanche ingrains flowing down an immobile pile. In this context, there have been promising advances to tie the microscopic grain dynamics near the avalanche front to the long-range fields. We will develop a common framework describing moving contact lines for both sliding drops and granular avalanches. We will employ so-called depth-averaged equations that have successfully been applied tcavalanches, and which are very similar to the lubrication theory for thin fluid layers. The latter will be used custody the drop shapes both analytically and numerically. To couple the continuum description to themicroscopies near the contact line we perform molecular dynamics simulations for both systems. In this multidisciplinary project, we benefit from the rapidly evolving fields of wetting, hydrodynamics and granular dynamics. The project provides a unique opportunity to combine these efforts; there will be a close collaboration with the granular lab at the Cole Normal Superior.

245,37118,No,External costs of transport in EXTERNE,"Objectives  Recent trends in economic thought, in particular the emphasis on sustainable development and the use of market mechanisms in environmental regulation, have given prominence to environmental externalities. Studies have shown that transport is a source of considerable environmental external costs. A comprehensive, consistent accounting framework for estimating energy related external costs of transport activities will be developed and applied. By means of the impact pathway approach-using exposure-response relationships-marginal impacts due to road, rail, air and waterway transport will be quantified and monetised.  The project focuses on impacts related to the use of energy (above all air pollution and global warming), but other impacts due to transport (e.g. accidents, noise or congestion) will be easy to integrate into the accounting framework.   Technical Approach  One of the main ideas of this project is to build up a system of building blocks. A 'building block' is characterised by a transport object (e.g. 1 person, 1 tonne of goods), a transport location (e.g. motorway Stuttgart-Munich) and a transport technology (e.g. car, 3way catalyst, emission standard EURO 2, engine displacement 1.4-2 l). Transport tasks (e.g. a journey from Stuttgart to Paris) can be assessed by combining different building blocks.  According to the impact pathway methodology, reference technologies have been defined which can be used to perform the transport tasks. The priority impacts, caused by the technologies under analysis have been identified. Required models (for dispersion, exposure-response relationships and monetary valuation) have been compiled and will be applied for implementing the impact pathways. Case studies for the UK, France, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy and Germany are carried out, taking into account urban, regional and trans-European transport tasks. Thus, a set of values for different building blocks will be provided. As studies in the transport sector have shown as well as the previous ExternE project, some of the impacts cannot be quantified with the currently available knowledge. If the quantification of a physical impact is impossible, other methods of assessment, such as sustainability or pressure indices are reviewed and applied.   Expected Achievements and Exploitation  An accounting framework for assessing the environmental externalities of the transport sector will be developed. As this framework is based on a system of building blocks it will be possible to provide data on different levels of aggregation. The results, marginal costs for selected transport tasks and technologies of road, rail, air and waterway transport, can be used for including environmental damage into models like energy-, transport-, E3-models. The results will allow to compare energy related impacts of current and future transport technologies. Completion of the accounting framework and aggregation will be the objective of a further project. The complete accounting framework will aid policy and decision makers in the E3-area to make optimal choices towards internalisation of transport externalities. Results can be integrated into activities of 'green accounting' at the national and European level.",1,0

373,97421,No,European Research Infrastructures for Nuclear Data Applications,"Different concepts involving critical (fast) reactors or subcritical accelerator-driven systems are being studied in view of their transmutation capabilities. These design studies imply high demands on the underlying nuclear database. The need for improved nuclear data has been expressed in the Strategic Research Agenda of the SNE-TP ( Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform). The accurate knowledge of neutron and proton induced nuclear reactions in the fast, intermediate- and high- energy domains (En = 1keV to 500 MeV) is of crucial importance for predicting the capabilities of reducing the inventory of plutonium, minor actinides, and long-lived fission products. In the past, this energy domain was not investigated with high priority because of minor importance for conventional light-water reactors. An additional challenge is the tightening demand on the accuracy of the data, especially for assessing criticality safety aspects and designing fuels for very high burn-up. The ERINDA project aims for a coordination of European efforts to exploit up-to-date neutron beam technology for novel research on advanced concepts for nuclear fission reactors and the transmutation of radioactive waste. Such waste is already existing in appreciable quantity due to the year-long operation of existing nuclear reactors and it will eventually also be generated during the running of new reactor types – albeit they can be optimized to produce much less of it. Research to the aim of finding techniques optimized for a strong reduction of nuclear waste can already be performed at existing nuclear facilities from the consortium proposed in this proposal. The main objective is to provide adequate transnational access to the infrastructures. The consortium will also provide funding for scientific support of experiments by short term visits of scientist to the participating facilities and  foster the communication and disseminaton of the results by organising scientific workshops.",0,0

To determine the sink strength of European forests for carbon and analyze the variables that determine the gains and the losses of carbon from forests of differing vegetation composition and in different climate regions.  To analyze the response of European forests water and carbon fluxes to climatic factors in order to aid regional scale modelling designed to predict impacts of global environmental change on forest ecosystem function.  To provide a common data-base of objective data for the validation of forest models, related to growth, partitioning of primary production, water cycling and hydrology.  To recommend management strategies for the conservation of carbon stores in forests.  Long-term measurements of the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy exchange are  carried out at 15 representative forest sites encompassing the entire range in European climate,  species distribution, and site conditions. The selected sites are representative of the regional  features of the European basin (Mediterranean, Boreal, Continental, Atlantic) and form a unique  integrated system for the analysis of climate related ecosystem processes, their impact on  hydrological and carbon cycles and test cases for validation of ecosystem models.  The methodology used by the 12 participating teams for the measurement of ecosystem fluxes  is eddy covariance, which has been standardized in terms of hardware and software among the  groups to obtain reproducible and comparable results.  Ecological processes including soil and biomass respiration, hydrological components and plant  physiology are ancillary measurements available at the sites to interpret ecosystem fluxes.  Long term series of continuous flux measurements will flow into a common data-base which will be available to the external community. The analysis of results, particularly in terms of carbon sequestering potential of forests will be  scaled to a European dimension and management strategies for conservation of carbon will be  indicated.",1,1

ABUITSS is a TBP Dissemination Action addressed to the Domain 7 of the Esprit Programme.  This project development will be based on the experience of the consortium partners and the results of previous EC projects which have highlighted great differences regarding TBP awareness between Southern Europe and Central & Northern Europe. These projects (PEPITA and COBRA), have also shown an important lack of awareness between SMEs in these regions and a different perception of real needs (metrics, methods, processes, etc;) between technology providers & consultants and end users. At the same time, there exists great expectations on BPO and IT for improving business practices in the target SMEs audience.  ABUITSS will carry out three activities in parallel; a survey and analysis to determine properly the understanding of the users concerning TBP (1000 SMEs will be mailed), an awareness action of BPO, BPR and TBP by developing and organising a set of training seminars (6 training seminars will be held), and a dissemination activity of the results of the ABUITSS analysis and other current TBP pilots of previous Esprit calls.  The dissemination activities will be also supported including the results of the TBP analysis in the CORDIS database, letting the Value Relay Centre Network know what is available, providing these results to the TBP Networks to be built up in Esprit, and by organising 4 workshops in Southern countries.  The consortium is composed of 4 partners from 5 different Member States with significant experience in TBP, dissemination and awareness actions and surveys, which are the core background technologies involved in the project.

It will do this by creating a transportable manufacturing cell consisting of a team of a team of cooperating climbing robot work tools whose activities are coordinated and integrated through a central intelligence. Unlike factory based cells the robot work tools must be mobile and able to climb over long distances, to great heights and over curved surfaces and surfaces with ridges or protrusions such as nodal joints, providing additional problems to be solved. Each robot will be dedicated to a different task to optimise overall system performance, hence there will be a surface profiler and navigator, welder , bolt and rivet placer, hot weld quality inspector, and cold weld inspector on separate platforms. The cell will be deployed through every stage of a product life cycle, during construction where the system will perform instant weld quality diagnostics and repairs, in service inspection and repair, and final lifetime assessment. Presently large fabrications on construction sites suffer from long fabrication times prescribed by traditional methods. The proposed mobile manufacturing cell will greatly reduce these times with economic benefits estimated at 630 MEuro per annum in save time and Labour and 2000MEuro in equipment sales taking EU export markets into account.

63,108117,Yes,Green Energy for Islands,"'Anthropogenically induced climate change is one of the most important problems the world faces today. Harmful greenhouse gas emissions must be decreased significantly in order to account for increases in the population and energy demand. Under the Europe 2020 flagship initiative for a resource-efficient Europe the Energy Efficiency Plan was adopted with the following priorities: (1) an economy that agrees with the planet’s resources, (2) low carbon systems, (3) improvement of EU energy independence and (4) improvement of the security of energy supply. Renewable energy resources satisfy all goals set by the European Union. They are abundant in nature and can provide energy generation with minimum emissions, while contributing towards energy independence and better security. Nevertheless, their application and adoption in communities is relatively slow. Social awareness can induce the active participation of the public in the reduction of energy consumption and the promotion of new technologies that can lead to more sustainable living. In Green Energy for Islands (GENERGIS) social issues will be coupled with local politics, energy policies with engineering practices and environmental benefits with economic considerations. This project aims to analyze the energy situation of an island in the Mediterranean and plan its transition towards energy sufficiency based on renewable resources. In contrast to most projects realized until today, GENERGIS will (1) greatly involve the people of the community in the decision-making process and raise public awareness, (2) involve local regulative authorities of the community, (3) perform more detailed technical calculations through simulations, as well as exhaustive economic and environmental analyses, and (4) propose a concrete energy plan for transitioning to 100% sustainable living.

Countries around the world are betting on EVs to meet sustainability targets. Battery cells are considered as the heart of EVs, and currently EU OEMs import around 90% of the battery cells from Asian companies. New materials and processes are needed if the EU wants to catch up with Asian battery manufacturers. SAFELiMOVE will gather key European actors in the battery sector, from industrial materials producers, to R&D centers and automotive industry, covering the complete knowledge and value chain. SAFELiMOVE will not only strengthen the R&D in the energy and automotive sectors but especially the European industry in these fields. SAFELiMOVE project aims to support a market-driven disruptive technology change towards high energy density batteries (450 Wh/kg or 1200 Wh/L) and improved safety in a cost-effective manner.

455,221907,No,Sustainable development Transition through Regulation-Induced technological Change,"The transition toward a sustainable economy has become an urgency rather than just a challenge. Rising to it demands a deep reconsideration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. The rapid degradation of the environment requires a swift and deep transformation. Our diverse team of researchers experienced in different, yet complementary disciplines, aims to provide rigorous scientific evidence on how regulation induces sustainable technological change? We build on expertise in economics, statistical modelling, computer programming and environmental law, and apply cutting-edge methods that have yet to be used to answer this important question. The Porter hypothesis claims, with mixed evidence, that environmental regulation may result in a win-win for the regulated firms through innovation offsets. By contrast, the regulation-induced technological change model we develop posits that stringent regulation will stimulate entry of new players. These are more likely to rise to the challenge with disruptive innovations, instead of incremental improvements by incumbent firms (Schumpeter’s creative destruction). We use the case of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program as an instance of regulatory shocks that are stringent enough to be qualified of technology forcing. We begin by calibrating a micro-founded model of regulation-induced technological change. We then investigate empirically the impact of the regulatory shocks on the economy by analyzing innovation and competitiveness; on workers by analyzing the effect of environmental policy stringency on labor skills; and on the environment by analyzing the effect of regulation on air quality. STRICt will thus deliver a comprehensive analysis of the impact of regulation-induced technological change on all three pillars of sustainable development. The evidence will improve the acceptability of ambitious policies and the achievement of international goals connecting economic and environmental gains.",1,0

A key objective of the ‘7-MW-WEC-by-11’ project is to introduce a new power class of large-scale Wind Energy Converters, the 7MW WEC, onto the market which has the potential to significantly contribute to higher market penetration levels for wind electricity in Europe. The new 7MW WEC will be designed and demonstrated at a large scale: eleven such WECs will be demonstrated in a 77 MW wind park close to Estinnes (Belgium). The wind park will be the first large-scale on-shore wind park in Belgium and the first in the world that will consist of this ‘mega’ turbine power class.  Key challenges related to wind power will be addressed in this demonstration action ranging from technical issues (network stability and security), to financial aspects (cost effectiveness) to environmental issues (landscape pollution). First, the ‘mega’ turbines will be developed and installed ‘in series’; this is envisioned to significantly reduce costs and increase the market value. Second, new power electronics technology and improved wind forecasting will be used to stabilise the grid in the high capacity wind park. “Improved forecasting” is envisioned to furthermore improve the cost-effectiveness of the high capacity wind park (reduced imbalance costs, improved commercial value). Third, the 7MW turbines will be used to maximize wind energy capacity, while reducing landscape pollution and environmental impact: such a WEC generates more than double the energy in the same given area when compared to conventional 2MW turbines and requires the placement of fewer turbines when compared to conventionally used wind turbines.  “Lessons learned” in developing the high capacity Estinnes wind park will be adapted to a different national context with a weak grid system, Cyprus.",0,0
607,189108,No,VIMSEN: Virtual Microgrids for Smart Energy Networks,"The subsidy feed in tariff policy, which has recently been adopted for accelerating renewable energy investments, cannot be retained as a sustainable business model for the future smart energy grid. This is mainly because this policy increases the energy cost, especially when the amount of the energy generated by renewable sources is not negligible compared to that generated by traditional ones, as is expected to be the case in the near future. Additionally, the current centralized electricity market prevents small or very small energy producers, who usually generate energy by renewable means (e.g., photovoltaic units or wind turbines), to participate. VIMSEN addresses the aforementioned difficulties by transforming the current centralized electricity market framework into a distributed one, introducing the concept of virtual micro-grid networks. Virtual micro-grids (VMGs) are associations of distributed energy generators and/or micro-grid networks that have agreed to operate on a common basis. VMGs provides flexibility to small or very small energy generators, since, i) they can re-distribute energy resources with each other to compensate energy production-distribution, and ii) they can directly participate in the electricity market through the respective association, which acts similarly as a big power generator unit. VIMSEN researches i) on an intelligent data metering techniques suitable for the VMG distributed network, ii) on information and decision making technologies for the dynamic VMG creation in a way to optimize the participants' benefits and macro-grid perspectives, iii) on a reliable communication infrastructure that permits Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for data exchange in the VMG network and iv) on an active energy management and control tool for the operation of the virtual micro-grid as a common virtual power unit. Business models to investigate the trade-off between the benefits of the association and the cost of the technologies needed to establish the VMGs will also be developed.",0,0
976,96385,No,The role of Rab7 in axonal retrograde transport and human pathologies,"Neurons are highly polarized cells that depend on anterograde and retrograde transport for survival, differentiation and maintenance of their morphology. Recently, impairment of axonal trafficking has been implicated as a causative agent in a number of human neurodegenerative disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B (CMT2B) neuropathy. CMT2B is characterized by the selective loss of motor and sensory neurons due to mutations in the small GTPase Rab7. Rab7 is a key component of the endocytic pathway in all eukaryotic cells and plays a major role in regulating long-range retrograde transport in motor neurons. However, we know very little about the cargoes and signalling components that enter this route, and how their transport is regulated. Furthermore, no animal model for the in vivo study of Rab7 is currently available. Therefore, the initial focus of my research project will be to generate novel mouse models, in which the activity of Rab7 is impaired. I will generate and characterise these mutant strains together with experts in the field, who kindly agreed to collaborate to this project. Furthermore, these mutant animals represent an invaluable tool to characterize the molecular and cellular role of Rab7 in axonal retrograde transport and its involvement in human neurodegeneration.",0,0
143,201698,No,Eye fundus colour images enhancement service for Diabetic Retinopathy diagnosis,"Diabetic retinopathy (“DR”) is considered as a priority eye disease by the World Health Organisation, as one of the main causes of visual impairment. It is a complication of the eye that can affect anyone who has diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy causes damage to the blood vessels supplying the retina – the “seeing” part of the eye. Because retinopathy generally has no obvious symptoms until it is advanced, early detection is essential. Detection is made by retinal screening. This is a straightforward procedure which includes assessment of visual acuity and eye fundus photography. Then a medical specialist, who looks for signs of diabetic retinopathy, gives a grade allowing a further diagnosis. This makes the diagnosis heavily dependent on the image quality. iPRI, which current activity is based on consulting expertise in public health, has identified a need for delivering a practical solution to the DR diagnosis challenge. iPRI has created a new prototype of software to enhance the quality of colour eye fundus exams. Several tests on representative databases have shown to DR experts that there is an important medical interest to introduce this service in the diagnostic procedure. IPRI’s international network of Key Opinion Leaders in Diabetes has confirmed this interest. Through the EYE-LIGHT project, iPRI aims to integrate this proven technology into a medical device. It will be provided as a professional application software service in order to facilitate the DR diagnosis, improve the image quality, allow comparisons and make images sharable through telemedicine. In order to address the unmet medical need, iPRI has to scale up, industrialise and sell this medical device.

532,226542,No,Impact of exposome on the course of lung diseases,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are two very debilitating non-communicable diseases that are of particular interest to consider in parallel in a human exposome study. Their roots are opposite: COPD is currently considered to be mainly related to the external exposome, while factors outside of the exposome play a major role in CF. However, COPD and CF share common characteristics such as high phenotypic variability of unknown origin, which prevents good therapeutic efficacy. It is therefore clear that the overall picture must be supplemented by taking into account additional components of the exposome than those currently considered in COPD and CF. Thus, the overall objective of the REMEDIA project is to extend the understanding of the contribution of the exposome, taken as a complex set of different components, to COPD and CF diseases. We will exploit data from existing cohorts and population registries in order to create a unified global database gathering phenotype and exposome information; we will develop a flexible individual sensor device combining environmental and biomarker toolkits; and use a versatile atmospheric simulation chamber to simulate the health effects of complex exposomes. We will use machine learning supervised analyses and causal inference models to identify relevant risk factors; and econometric and cost-effectiveness models to assess the costs, performance and cost-effectiveness of a selection of prevention strategies. The results will be used to develop guidelines to better predict disease risks and constitute the elements of the REMEDIA toolbox (global unified database, sensor device, versatile atmospheric simulation chamber, machine learning supervised analyses, causal inference model, Pan-European multi-criteria risk assessment tool, econometric models, cost-effectiveness models, new guidelines and recommendations). Deciphering the impact of environmental components throughout life on the phenotypic variability of COPD and CF could represent a major breakthrough in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with these two non-curable diseases and would lead to the identification of modifiable risk factors on which preventive action could be implemented.

The District of the Future (DoF) project is a project funded by the European Union (EU) with the objective to increase energy efficiency in a city district using innovative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) approaches. It will help city leaders to achieve quantifiable and significant reduction up to 30 to 40% of energy consumption and CO2 emissions and will improve citizen awareness and people involvement.The project will be executed by a consortium formed by a world leader in integrated telecommunications, technological consultancy firms, ICT software and equipment providers, SMEs, a Research and Development organization, energy companies and the public authorities of the cities of Sabadell (Spain), Orléans (France) and Corby (UK) that will provide the real life environment for the project.DoF will use ICT to collect, register and monitor energy data and bring this to a cloud-based software platform. This platform will analyze energy patterns in each city district. That will allow predicting energy consumption and energy production behavior in each district. DoF will provide a system based upon standardized state-of-the-art communications, that will support city authorities and citizens in taking the right decisions in order to optimize energy systems and improve energy efficiency in the involved city districts.The project will contribute to the adoption of green ICT technologies by city authorities. Just by reapplying the DoF approach in other European city districts the project will make a sustainable contribution to the objectives of EC 2020 Energy and Climate Change, 20% of energy from renewable, 20% increase of energy efficiency, 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990.",1,0
610,200197,No,"High Nature Value Farming: Learning, Innovation and Knowledge.","'High nature value (HNV) farmland designates “those areas in Europe where agriculture is a major land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both”. They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure. For national and local authorities, the European Union and the Common Agricultural Policy, and for stakeholders, the challenge is twofold:  •  to avoid further degradation and disappearance of HNV farming and increase their socio-economic viability: this could be done by collating, evaluating and disseminating innovations as tools for their development;  • to maintain their “natural value”, i.e the environmental services they provide to the society.  For these reasons, our consortium, an EIP Agri Focus Group and new partners, propose a network dedicated to supporting HNV farming, networking HNV areas covering a range of different farming systems across the EU, and to focussing on innovations improving simultaneously “socio-economic viability” and “environmental efficiency”.  Conceived as a “support service” for knowledge and innovation exchanges, the HNV-Link network will give a decisive new impetus to this sector, and will provide tools to organisations, actors and networks supporting HNV farmlands. The marginality of HNV areas in conventional research and development means that HNV farming-related innovation is rarely discussed in academic exchanges. Our thematic network, both grassroots-based and transnational, can really make a difference, by connecting farmers and innovation actors in line with the vision of the EIP-Agri “operational groups'.

863,213328,No,"Production of renewable methanol from captured emissions and renewable energy sources, for its utilisation for clean fuel production and green consumer goods","Headquartered in Reykjavik, Iceland, Carbon Recycling International (CRI) is the world leader in power to methanol technology. The company has accumulated a decade of experience in solving the problems of economical CO2 capture and valorisation as well as reliable and cost effective large-scale production of hydrogen by electrolysis.  CRI invented a new integrated process for sustainable low-carbon intensity fuel production. CRI’s Emissions-to-Liquids (ETL) technology has been scaled up from a laboratory scale pilot to an operating industrial scale plant with a capacity of 4,000 tons/year methanol production.  Low carbon intensity methanol production with CRI technology reduces carbon emissions by more than 90% compared to fossil fuels. ETL is a sustainable process of renewable fuel production which has no impact on our food chain or land use. Methanol produced by CRI can also be directly used in the chemical industry for the manufacturing of sustainable goods such as paints and plastics. CRI aims to up-scale its current plant scale and offer a standard, modular ETL plant design with nominal 50.000 t/yr methanol production capacity. The improved ETL technology achieved with the current innovation project, will enable CRI to efficiently operate using variable power sources or stranded energy assets. One of the defining characteristics of renewable power sources such as wind and solar is their interment and variable production levels. High capacity factor production sites are often untapped or under-utilized due to the lack of adequate transmission line access or capacity. CRI will provide a means to valorise under utilized renewable energy sources. Our mission is that by 2022 in total 1million tn/yr methanol capacity is commissioned. This corresponds to 1.45 million tonnes of CO2 recycled per year. With a proven and scalable technology, based on predictable costs, limited competition and vast market potential, CRI has a strong foundation to achieve its mission.",0,0

New directives push for deep retrofitting efforts, in order to achieve energy efficiency and RES adoption targets for 2020 and beyond. These require acting both on envelope and on energy use systems, mainly heating and DHW equipment that representing 51% of energy use in this sector. Frequently the upgrade of the envelope insulation is subject to constraints (i.e. historical centres, availability of space, need to relocate the tenants, costs and time issues) and acting on the heating plant is the only viable option. Currently solutions are not always suitable or cost effective in existing buildings (radiators, DHW, solar radiation in winter). Therefore to accelerate the improvement in energy efficiency and in the use of renewable energy in the residential building, a specifically designed solution needs to be made available. HEAT4U is an Industry led project whose main objective is to develop a Gas Absorption Heat Pump (GAHP) solution with efficiency on primary energy of 165% (EN12309) to allow a cost-effective use of renewable energy in existing residential building for heating and DHW services. The project is conceived to overcome a number of technological and non-technological barriers which currently prevent GAHP application in single family houses or small multi-storey buildings. HEAT4U main objectives are: -i) Development of Appliance with specifications suitable for the residential market (10 – 25 kW); ii) integration of the technology in existing heating and DHW architectures; iii) Development of a decision support system, enabling the optimal design in different building operating conditions; iv) Dissemination activity to promote the awareness of the benefits of the GAHP technology.

Due to its point source characteristics an LED requires a means to collimate and shed the emitted light onto larger areas. Diffractive optics (DO) elements consisting of highly complex micro structured surfaces provide a solution to this problem, allowing the controlled collimation and distribution of point source light. However, there are significant challenges associated with the production of DO-elements making them expensive and limit size as well as achievable illumination performance. In order to exhaust the vast potential of LED illumination, an economic solution of the production of high performance DO-elements is required.  Therefore, in the proposed project a new technology will be developed, providing a high throughput, highly flexible process for the patterning of large area complex micro structures, thus allowing the low cost, high volume production of large area micro structured surfaces for the use in diffractive optics elements. The proposed work will result in a novel technology for high volume production of DO-patterned surfaces, answering to an ever increasing demand for advanced light management and illumination solutions. More importantly even, this technology will bridge the gap between conventional micro manufacturing technologies and industrial scale, cost effective production of a new generation of innovative, high value added products. The proposed project will contribute directly to the creation of new capabilities at the European level, enabling the transfer of laboratory scale manufacturing processes to an industrial scale production of high quality, large area DO-elements for use in a variety of advance lighting solutions, thus strengthening Europe against Asian competition in the lucrative high end consumer products market.",0,0

There remain significant research challenges before a high efficacy, high lumen output, retrofit lamp with high quality white light can be made at an affordable price. In mainstream LED lighting, white light is obtained from a phosphor layer which is placed on top of a blue light-emitting LED. OPERA will place the LEDs in a highly-reflective light-mixing chamber with the phosphor at the exit surface, reducing phosphor temperature to 80oC and light intensity 1000x less, inexpensive and wavelength-tunable organic phosphors used instead of costly and export-restricted rare-earth based inorganic phosphors. We introduce two new innovations improving the system efficiency: 1) Introduce a new set of organic phosphors with significantly higher efficiencies and long lifetimes (50000hrs). 2) Increase the efficacy of the LED light engine by replacing state-of-the-art inefficient light diffusers with efficient diffractive optics complemented with an improved reflectivity of the mixing chambers. OPERA will demonstrate a breakthrough in LED light engines which will DOUBLE the luminous efficacy of the state-of-the-art direct phosphor-converted LED modules. Resulting in two demonstrators: 1) LED engine with efficacy of 130Lm/Watt CCT 2700K with CRI 90 Incandescent 2) LED engine with efficacy of 150Lm/W at CCT 4000K with CRI 80 Fluorescent tube. The consortium addresses the research challenges associated with the remote phosphor optical configuration, efficient stable organic phosphor definition and components for light engine construction.  We give European industry an important role in design and manufacturing of optical components based on alternative phosphors for light conversion and light engine construction.

The Strominger system arises in the theory of heterotic supergravity and has been proposed by Shing-Tung Yau as one of the fundamental perspectives of complex geometry, in relation to the moduli problem for Calabi-Yau manifolds. The goal is to complete four research tasks, designed, on the one hand, to make progress on Yau's conjecture for the Strominger system and, on the other hand, to understand rigorously, in one simple example, a conjectural, fundamental, symmetry of the underlying physical theory, known as (0,2)-mirror symmetry.

The main goal of beAWARE is to provide support in all the phases of an emergency incident. More specifically, we propose an integrated solution to support forecasting, early warnings, transmission and routing of the emergency data, aggregated analysis of multimodal data and management the coordination between the first responders and the authorities. Our intention is to rely on platforms, theories and methodologies that are already used for disaster forecasting and management and add the elements that are necessary to make them working efficiently and in harm under the same objective. The overall context for beAWARE lies in the domain of situational awareness and command and control (C2). The first phase concerns the forecast of the extreme condition and the relevant preparations. Once a disaster occurs, an initial assessment needs to be conducted as soon as possible to determine the scope, geographical distribution, and scale of the incident. Situational awareness means being able to accurately determine what has happened, what is happening now, and what will come next, all in order to plan and coordinate the most effective response possible with the resources available. This observation phase will lead to an orientation phase suggesting both an individual as well as collective “cognition” orientation to data that is sensed and communicated. Once orientation to the data (or the lack of it) occurs then a decision is made, ultimately resulting is the final step, which is “act”.

Neutrinos can lead us on the trail to new physics, together with experiments at the LHC, flavor physics and cosmology. The best time for carrying out this project is now. Neutrino physics is more vibrant than ever as a renewed flow of key data has just begun. First evidence that the hitherto unknown value of the third neutrino mixing angle theta(13) is sizeable raises concrete hopes of observing CP-violation in the lepton sector, triggering new ideas for model building. Moreover, the entire neutrino community is intrigued by several experimental anomalies that hint at unexpected neutrino properties. This animated scenery provides an ideal stage for the 'NuTrails' project, having neutrinos as its main actors. Following the trails of these elusive particles to the smallest scales will serve as a formidable guide to new discoveries.  More specifically, this project will focus on two different classes of standard-model extensions. First, signs for new physics originating from heavy mediators at the TeV scale will be studied. Second, manifestations of a new low-energy scale will be sought, hunting for light 'sterile' neutrinos with mass in the eV range.  Theoretical questions related to neutrino flavor conversion in the presence of such new properties will be addressed.  Furthermore, observable consequences for present and future experiments will be quantified. These results will have far-reaching implications, extending from particle phenomenology to astrophysics and cosmology. Most importantly, the quantitative simulations will decisively influence the next round of experimental strategies.'",0,0
214,222906,No,Eschatological time as women’s time? Gendered temporality and female holiness in Early Christianity and Byzantium,"This proposal investigates the nexus between time and the construction of the feminine in Late Antique and Byzantine hagiographical discourses. By looking both at ways time is experienced through the body and construed by society and religion, GenTime engages with a highly debated problem in Byzantine studies: why did female saints progressively disappear over the Byzantine millennium? GenTime argues that this trajectory has to be understood against the eschatological expectations shaping early Christian ideals of female holiness. In the 2nd and 3rd century the impending end of times subsumed any other temporality and led to the subversion of traditionally construed “women’s time”. Once the Roman Empire became Christian, the eschatological horizon was reinforced in Byzantium by the widespread circulation of apocalyptic motives, adopted by the Imperial power for political and moral purposes. Eschatologically-motivated narrative patterns about women saints became entrenched and their ongoing success made it hard to accommodate new experiences of holiness when other models of lay temporality eventually emerged during the Middle Byzantine era. GenTime looks at stories about women saints produced between the 2nd and the 13th century CE by adopting a longue durée perspective and using narratology to analyze how patterns of temporalities are inscribed in the text. It builds on feminist phenomenology to highlight the persistence of strategies used to control women’s time within patriarchal social orders. GenTime works with medieval sources and it reflects on the dialectics between integration/assimilation, minority/majority cultures, gender/societal values, all of them of major concern in modern societies. In doing so, it raises awareness about the ways gendered discourses of time have historically been used to promote lifestyles that, ultimately, have less to do with women’s empowerment and more with power struggles between competing social groups.",0,0
115,220674,Yes,Altered eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a future climate,"Current scenarios predict an accelerated biodiversity erosion with climate change. However, uncertainties in predictions remain large because the multitude of climate change effects from genes to ecosystems and their interdependencies are still overlooked. This incomplete vision hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies to sustain biodiversity.   Climate change can directly modify the phenotype and performance of individuals through phenotypic plasticity and evolution on contemporary time scales. The microevolution of keystone species can spread throughout the whole ecological network due to changes in species interactions and further translate into an altered ecosystem functioning. Conversely, direct impacts on communities and ecosystems can have ripple effects on the phenotypic distribution and evolution of all species of ecological networks.  Climate-driven changes at individual and population levels can shape community composition and ecosystem functioning, and vice versa, altering eco-evolutionary feedbacks, namely the reciprocal interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes. Climate-driven ecological and evolutionary dynamics are yet often investigated separately. The role of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in climate change impacts on biological systems therefore hinges on little concrete empirical evidence contrasting with a profuse theoretical development. ECOFEED will investigate climate-dependent eco-evolutionary feedbacks using a 6 year-long realistic warming experiment reproducing natural conditions and thus allowing for both evolutionary and ecological dynamics to occur under a predicted climate change scenario. Complementary laboratory experiments will quantify reciprocal impacts of climate-dependent evolutionary and ecological changes on each other. ECOFEED will provide unprecedented insights on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a future climate and will ultimately help refine predictions on the future of biodiversity.",1,1
411,208083,No,Analog Quantum Simulation using Superconducting Qubits,"AQSuS aims at experimentally implementing analogue quantum simulation of interacting spin models in two-dimensional geometries. The proposed experimental approach paves the way to investigate a broad range of currently inaccessible quantum phenomena, for which existing analytical and numerical methods reach their limitations. Developing precisely controlled interacting quantum systems in 2D is an important current goal well beyond the field of quantum simulation and has applications in e.g. solid state physics, computing and metrology. To access these models, I propose to develop a novel circuit quantum-electrodynamics (cQED) platform based on the 3D transmon qubit architecture. This platform utilizes the highly engineerable properties and long coherence times of these qubits. A central novel idea behind AQSuS is to exploit the spatial dependence of the naturally occurring dipolar interactions between the qubits to engineer the desired spin-spin interactions. This approach avoids the complicated wiring, typical for other cQED experiments and reduces the complexity of the experimental setup. The scheme is therefore directly scalable to larger systems. The experimental goals are:  1) Demonstrate analogue quantum simulation of an interacting spin system in 1D & 2D. 2) Establish methods to precisely initialize the state of the system, control the interactions and readout single qubit states and multi-qubit correlations. 3) Investigate unobserved quantum phenomena on 2D geometries e.g. kagome and triangular lattices. 4) Study open system dynamics with interacting spin systems.   AQSuS builds on my backgrounds in both superconducting qubits and quantum simulation with trapped-ions. With theory collaborators my young research group and I have recently published an article in PRB [9] describing and analysing the proposed platform. The ERC starting grant would allow me to open a big new research direction and capitalize on the foundations established over the last two years.",0,0

For developing this strategy, hydrogen quality risk assessment is used to define the needs for hydrogen impurity gas analysis, system level PEMFC contaminant research as well as needs for purification needs in hydrogen production, especially produced by steam methane reforming (SMR).  The use of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment enables identification of critical needs for gas analysis development and guides the research work on those issues, which require most attention. The development of quantitative risk model enables implementation of data from other parallel activities in USA, Japan and Korea.

167,71152,No,Integrated secure platform for interactive personal devices,"More than other IT domains, the smart card industry is facing the challenge to reinvent itself in the fast moving high-tech area where seamless connection, mobility and security are key aspects. This breakthrough is only possible by changing the fundamentals of the smart card and by creating a new and open technology platform. The smart card has been successful in providing a first generation of secure, personalized and portable device to millions of users principally in off-line applications such as bank and telecom. INSPIRED will develop the second generation called Trusted Personal Device (TPD) to provide Trust and Security to users and on-line services in the future ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing environments.  The concept of an individual object representing the root of trust is the paradigm which definitely made the success of the smart card. INSPIRED intends to rely on it and to extend it to the next generation of secure communicating devices. These devices will have different form factors and features depending of the targeted applications. INSPIRED aims at defining the common technical foundations to allow cost-efficient product developments of devices with extended features and performances that can better be integrated in heterogeneous networks.  The INSPIRED consortium gathers the large majority of the stakeholders in the European smart card arena including the major smart card manufacturers, vendors of chips and sensors for smart cards and leading research institutes. The consortium also includes companies representing Users from dynamic market segments such as Telecom, electronic ID, on-line services and digital rights management for requirements, concept definition and validation of the project results.

757,90066,No,Production and perception of emotion: An affective sciences approach,"Emotion is a prime example of the complexity of human mind and behaviour, a psychobiological mechanism shaped by language and culture, which has puzzled scholars in the humanities and social sciences over the centuries. In an effort to reconcile conflicting theoretical traditions, we advocate a componential approach which treats event appraisal, motivational shifts, physiological responses, motor expression, and subjective feeling as dynamically interrelated and integrated components during emotion episodes. Using a prediction-generating theoretical model, we will address both production (elicitation and reaction patterns) and perception (observer inference of emotion from expressive cues). Key issues are the cognitive architecture and mental chronometry of appraisal, neurophysiological structures of relevance and valence detection, the emergence of conscious feelings due to the synchronization of brain/body systems, the generating mechanism for motor expression, the dimensionality of affective space, and the role of embodiment and empathy in perceiving and interpreting emotional expressions. Using multiple paradigms in laboratory, game, simulation, virtual reality, and field settings, we will critically test theory-driven hypotheses by examining brain structures and circuits (via neuroimagery), behaviour (via monitoring decisions and actions), psychophysiological responses (via electrographic recording), facial, vocal, and bodily expressions (via micro-coding and image processing), and conscious feeling (via advanced self-report procedures). In this endeavour, we benefit from extensive research experience, access to outstanding infrastructure, advanced analysis and synthesis methods, validated experimental paradigms as well as, most importantly, from the joint competence of an interdisciplinary affective science group involving philosophers, linguists, psychologists, neuroscientists, behavioural economists, anthropologists, and computer scientists.",0,0

6,106592,Yes,Enhancing risk management partnerships for catastrophic natural disasters in Europe,"The main goal of the ENHANCE project is to develop and analyse new ways to enhance society’s resilience to catastrophic natural hazard impacts, by providing new scenarios and information in selected hazard cases in close collaboration with stakeholders, and by contributing to the development of new multi-sector partnerships (MSPs) to reduce or redistribute risk.  Innovation in MSPs is essential, as (ineffective) cooperation between public, private and civil society institutions often leads to failures in risk management. The ENHANCE proposal is unique as it studies the potential for new MSPs for managing different catastrophic hazards, related to heat waves, forest fires, flood, drought, storm surge, and volcanic eruptions. Key to successful partnerships is a common understanding of risks and the implications of proposed risk reduction instruments. Therefore, ENHANCE facilitates a participatory process to develop MSPs in cases studies at different geographical- and spatial scales in Europe. The main products of ENHANCE are a) a harmonised dynamic scenarios of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard at the pan-European scale, using existing information and new probabilistic approaches for multi-hazards, heat-waves, forest fires, floods, droughts, storm surges, and volcanic eruptions; b) guidelines and key features for enhancing MSP interaction in successful resilience enhancement and risk reduction, pre-tested via participatory workshops on risk-based scenarios; c) methods for linking MSPs to novel scientific risk scenarios and assessments; d) a toolbox of economic instruments and non-structural mitigation measures at the national, regional, and local levels developed in a participatory manner and aimed at assessing risk and increasing societal resilience; and e) policy recommendations to the EU and HFA signatories delivered through a dissemination platform for enhancing resilience from high political levels to local communities. ENHANCE offers a team that consists of scientific research institutes, public policy organisations including UNISDR, private sector specialists and an NGO that ensure societal relevance and the feasibility of implementation of our deliverables. Within 10 case studies public and private partners will be approached to develop MSPs and to test our methods.

The overall objective of ZAS is to enable the use of distributed and intermittent renewable energy sources by further developing this type of battery technology. The new battery is expected to have an energy density higher than 250 Wh/kg and 300 Wh/L, and reversibility of more than 1000 cycles at 80 % DOD, good safety performance and a cost lower than 300 €/kWh.  Through close interaction between computer simulations and experimental testing, ZAS will select and develop nanostructured electrode and electrolyte materials used in an innovative cell design. Modelling materials, structures, and dynamics on different length scales will contribute to a rational cell. After generation of the materials and validation of our full cell model, we will predict cell performance for a variety of cell designs and operating conditions, providing data into the technology validation by simulating different scenarios including hybrid systems in which zinc-air batteries are used as storage devices. The synergy with other technologies will be obtained through the strong experience the members of the consortium possess towards other types of metal-air batteries and in related technologies e.g. hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers. The involvement of an end user in the consortium will ensure that the developed technology meets the requirements for hybrid constellations of energy storage. The exploitation and business plan developed in ZAS will be based explicitly on energy system simulation and validation of the feasibility of using zinc-air batteries for energy storage by performing life cycle assessment (LCA).

556,39020,No,"Design and assessment of global, european and regional scale UV irradiance maps based on satellite data and ground measurments.","The main objective of MAUVE is to establish maps of surface W radiation, derived from satellite data, as a recognised source of information for a variety of applications including trend studies, documentation of potential environmental changes and risks assessment for human health. Only satellite derived W maps can provide the needed global and synoptic information. Indeed, although the ground network of instruments will always retain its reference role in terms of accuracy, its density is and will remain limited, even in Europe but evidently in less favoured areas of the world. However, the use of satellite derived maps of surface W radiation is presently impaired by their poorly assessed accuracy. Therefore, key tasks in MAWE are to improve the existing products, customise them to the users needs and validate them against reference ground measurements.  The MAUVE products will be based on methodologies developed in the framework of several national ongoing activities. The Institutes conducting these projects are Partners in MAWE and aim at integrating their approaches into two validated products: global and high spatial resolution. Five of the MAUVE Partners are also future users of the surface UV radiation maps and other end users are associated to the project.  A goal in terms of accuracy is not easy to define because the achievable result will depend on the meteorological conditions (clouds, aerosols) and other environmental factors such as e.g. the presence of snow. The accuracy will also be very different for instantaneous observations or, for instance, monthly averages. Therefore, instead of trying to define the products on an abstract basis and risking to issue requirements which will rapidly prove to be impossible to fulfil, the project starts by building and assessing a demonstration data set. The requirements are then defined using this initial information.  Apart from the accuracy, other characteristics of the products have to be defined such as the geographical and temporal coverage, the map content (spectra, dose rates, extrapolated doses, temporal averages), etc. . The first phase of the project will result in the definition of a 'pilot data set' to be produced and assessed.  The necessary improvements are the object of the second main work package. Although the precise goals for these improvements will be defined in the first phase, we already know that the main issues will be a better assimilation of data on clouds, aerosols and surface albedo. Tasks have been planned on these topics. The final phase of the project will consist in a thorough assessment/validation of the achieved results and in the definition of requirements to possible operational services for providing satellite derived surface UV radiation maps.  A WEB page (linked to the CEO ES/EWSE) will include a comprehensive description of the project, news about the project, links to download the electronic versions of the reports and examples of the produced UV maps.

Objectives and content  This project is concerned with the problems of heat  transfer and fluid flow within gas turbine internal  cooling air systems, with the aim of improving the design  of the latter for both advanced aircraft and electrical  power generation gas turbines. Participants in the  proposal are ten major European engine manufacturers and  four Universities specialising in this type of work.  The approaches will include; (a) advanced experimental  work to obtain much improved data under representative  operating conditions, (b) evaluation of flow and heat  transfer models and CFD codes, (c) development of  improved 3D models and correlation's for design purposes  and (d) establishing a more standardised European  approach to these problems.

838,215556,No,Probing and controlling the three-dimensional organoid mechanobiology,"Interaction between cells and their mechanical microenvironment plays a key role in the regulation of development, physiology and disease. Cell behaviour is also regulated by the dimensionality of the microenvironment: 2D cultures display biological traits that generally differ from those of 3D tissues, thus limiting their potential in biomedical research. This limitation has been addressed by the recent development of Organoids, which faithfully preserve a number of distinctive tissue traits. Still, current biophysical tools and conceptual frameworks are not yet suitable to probe and understand the mechanobiology of 3D organoid systems.  This project aims to study and manipulate the mechanobiology of normal gut and colorectal cancer organoids. We will develop tools to quantify the 3D stresses applied by an organoid embedded in a gel. By measuring its 3D surface stresses and Young’s modulus we will quantify its interstitial pressure and contractility, key parameters in organ growth and tumour progression.  Pressure and contractility will be related with key biological parameters such as geometry, cell adhesion and proliferation. We will fluorescently tag proteins in the organoids that will allow us to track individual cells, as well as monitoring their polarization and adhesion. The relationship between mechanics, geometry, and cell function will be further assessed by chemically reducing proliferation, mechanical stresses and adhesion.  We will also modify the mechanical state of the organoids through optogenetic means. We will express proteins in the cells to control Rho-GTPases upon illumination, thereby steering the local stresses at will. We will modify organoid pressure, contractility and geometry and study their influence on the phenotype.  As organoids emerge as novel tools in biomedical research, we expect that studying and manipulating their mechanobiology will bring key insight into disease and development processes, and potential new therapeutic targets.",0,0

Literature on urbanization in China focuses mainly on traditional large metropolitan or industrial cities in the center with Han majority population, and examines either the structural or the subjective features of urban development. The complex dynamics of urbanization and power relations in the new cities in the periphery remain understudied. The project fills this knowledge gap, by exploring how urbanization intersects with tourism growth and in-migration and affects ethnic relations in Jinghong, a fast-growing city in China’s south-western borderlands. In Jinghong, the Han, China’s ethnic majority, have become the city’s drivers of urban and economic development, competing over land, resources and political power with long-term Dai/Tai minority ethnic residents.

1003,103692,No,The autonomous assessment of aircraft sound power and position,"'Noise is a main pollutant of airports. At present there are two main tools used to manage the impact of airport noise – computer simulated noise contour maps (NCM) and aircraft noise monitoring systems (NMS). Currently both systems have shortcomings. The aim of this research project is to overcome these and improve the accuracy of both systems. NCMs describe the area around the airport affected by a given noise level (allowing the straightforward calculation of the exposed population) while NMSs provide discrete information on the noise level at individual locations near the airport. NCMs rely on noise data extrapolated from aircraft certification tests, which often do not represent accurately the noise encountered on the ground. NMSs overcome this by measuring the actual noise levels. However, NMS data may be influenced by the background noise at measurement sites. The objective of this project is to develop an improved NMS that can supply accurate and timely data to noise simulation software. By combining the two methods, it would be possible to design a comprehensive tool for managing the noise impact of airports. There are three key advantages of the improved NMS: the provision of accurate aircraft sound power data for the entire aircraft trajectory, the removal of background noise influence on measurements, and independence from airport radar systems. This project will place European research on the acoustic impact of airports in a leading position by improving European aircraft noise prediction models.  In addition, it will have an economic impact on the industry, allowing European vendors to offer such an enhanced system to airport management entities globally.  Finally, it will have an effect on European airport noise policy by providing a reliable method of detecting high noise flyovers.  On this basis, the application of noise charges can be properly used as an incentive to follow pre-determined minimum noise flight paths and use quieter aircraft.'",0,0
434,220280,No,high capacity planet BEAring Technology for High Efficiency  gearbox,"The Ultra High By-pass Ratio (UHBR) engine provides environmental benefits through a high power gearbox decoupling fan and turbine speeds. To implement such engine different technological issues raise: the increase of the i) rotational speed, ii) harsh lubrication conditions and iii) power density. The design of the rolling bearing, crucial component, can affect the gearbox and engine efficiency, performance and reliability. The aim of BrEATHE is to develop, design, model and test a rolling bearing to be mounted in a high power gearbox, including investigation for new high loaded materials, development of models to predicts bearing behavior, producing samples and test them in dedicated test bench.  Specific project objectives are: - To define the geometry and perform the design of the bearing. To predict heat generation and transfer in the planet bearing through interactions between dynamic and thermal behaviours.  - To demonstrate a -30% in power loss & oil flow and a 15% increase in rolling contact stress capability in comparison to the current baseline solutions and without any detrimental effect on reliability. - To assess the benefits of different process technologies and materials in reaching the efficiency and stress capability required by the gearbox and engine architecture. Including design optimization, comparison of different case hardened steel grade coupled with ceramic rolling elements. - To produce a sufficient number of bearings to sustain the test plan based on a dedicated test bench.  To demonstrate their enhanced performances, the BrEATHE new bearing technologies will firstly assessed through modelling and then testes in full-scale testing, with full duty cycle representing the real flight spectrum.

676,186816,No,Cyber Security and Resilience of Networked Critical Infrastructures,"'Modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCIs), e.g. the electrical grid, rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for their operation since ICT can lead to cost reduction as well as greater efficiency, flexibility and interoperability between components. In the past NCIs were isolated environments and used proprietary hardware and protocols, limiting thus the threats that could affect them. Nowadays, with the adoption of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) ICT, NCIs are exposed to significant cyber threats that can lead to economical and human losses.  To address the aforementioned issues, this project aims at elaborating novel holistic methodologies for the design of security and resilience-aware ICT infrastructures for NCIs. The project will develop state-of-the-art techniques and tools to aid engineers in designing secure and resilient industrial ICT-based installations.  The novelty of the project consists in the fact that it will fuse together the cyber and physical dimensions of NCI, an important aspect that is missing from existing approaches. The project will create novel NCI network design techniques by solving multi-criteria optimization problems that take into account several aspects such as NCI design standards, e.g. NIST SP 800-82 and NERC CIP 002-009, resilient operation of physical process, but also installation-specific information, e.g. geographical aspects. The project will also provide more effective protection mechanisms, e.g. cyber-physical Intrusion Detection Systems, by combining data from cyber and physical sensors.  The proposed research lies in the context of the 'European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection' (EPCIP), the 'Critical Information Infrastructure Protection' (CIIP) action plan and the 'Digital Agenda for Europe' (DAE) by addressing key security and resilience issues of NCIs that will ultimately lead to the better protection of existing and future Critical Infrastructures.'",0,0
928,204299,No,Novel closed-cage system for high-value marine aquaculture,"The global demand for seafood is in a period of exceptional growth, making up 16% of all consumed animal protein, or 119m tonnes annually, expected to increase to 152m tonnes by 2030. Wild stocks, are near or beyond their sustainable limit, resulting in an annual production shortfall of ca. 30m tonnes by 2030. Farmed seafood provides a clear, viable alternative and consumer demand can thus drive a striking growth in aquaculture, if current technological and regulatory barriers can be overcome.  Currently marine aquaculture uses net-based open aquaculture systems (OAS) concentrating high numbers of fish in a confined area, leading to disease outbreaks (and transmission to wild stocks), pollution by fish sludge and chemicals used against diseases and algae growths, and from fish escapes, all threatening wild stocks and the local environment. The regulatory response varies but tends towards strict limits on production capacity, expected to tighten further in coming years, which, combined with the shortage of appropriate, sheltered in-shore seasites, act as a major barrier to further expansion and growth for European and global marine aquaculture.  To unlock aquaculture’s potential for Blue Growth and jobs creation, alternative technologies must be brought to market; technologies that limit or eliminate the environmental impact of OAS in a cost-efficient way to preserve the environment while boosting the competitiveness and profitability of European marine aquaculture by allowing expansion. With NEPTUN, we will bring to market a cost-effective, closed-cage aquaculture system that combines an impermeable and durable fibreglass enclosure with an innovative hatch technology, optimising day-to-day management and operational control. The durable construction eliminates fish escapes while enablning a far higher degree of control of pathogens thus significantly lowering the need for pharmaceuticals and pesticides as well as reducing the economic risks from disease outbreaks.",0,0
18,78896,Yes,"Interactions between fire, biosphere and atmosphere in a coupled vegetation-climate system","Fire plays an important role in vegetation dynamics, in biogeochemical cycles, and fire-related emissions have important impacts on atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing. The impact of fire-related trace gas and aerosol emissions on the atmosphere ha s been estimated using a variety of modelling tools. Progress in understanding the role of fire and fire-related emissions within the coupled vegetation-climate system clearly requires a full coupling between these various components. The proposal aims to couple an existing fire model into a vegetation-climate model, which can then investigate effects of fire on both, climate and vegetation dynamics. The coupled model will be validated against contemporary and palaeoenvironmental data. Palaeoenvironmental r econstructions reveal open scientific issues relating to the source/sink distribution of major trace gases from the last glacial maximum to the present. The role of fire has not been examined with respect to changes in the oxidization capacity of the atmos phere and potential climate feedbacks. During the project, simulation experiments will be conducted for three palaeoclimate time periods to better understand the behaviour of the Earth System under changing climate conditions. This knowledge is very import ant for projections about future climate change and their implications for the global carbon cycle as well as climate policy. The project will be conducted in cooperation with scientists from relevant fields at Bristol University, UK. Simulated estimates o f biomass burning will be provided with consistent climate data for future applications in Chemistry Transport Models, which until now cannot consider the influence of interannual climate variability and vegetation dynamics. This product will allow further investigations of transient climate changes since the Last Glacial Maximum as well as improve projections of future climate change.",1,1
32,38987,Yes,Low emission technology programme - Phase III Part 2: (LOWNOX III PART 2),"A major challenge is to respond to current and prospective public concerns regarding the pollution and physical changes to the environment caused by aircraft engine emissions. Indeed, one of the major problems that civil aeronautics will have to face over the next twenty to thirty years is to accommodate the predicted growth in demand of air transport without adverse effects on the environment. To overcome this problem will require both the development of advanced, environmentally friendly technologies and the conduct of scientific researches to increase the understanding of basic phenomena. A particular concern relates to the possibility that emissions of oxides of nitrogen (IsTOX) and other minor species from aircraft flying in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (8 - 25 km), whether from current subsonic or, in the future, from possible supersonic operations, may make a significant contribution to global warming and ozone generation or depletion. In the preceding phases of this Framework programme (Pilot Phase /1/ and Interim Phase 121) three major methods of Nitrogen oxide reduction were identified. These methods differ not only in their NOX reduction potential, but also in their complexity and technical feasibility.  The first concept with the lowest NOX reduction potential incorporates the lean combustion method without premixing in a staged - Double Annular Combustor  design. The second method also uses lean combustion but improvements in NOX reduction can be obtained by introducing a premix duct so that a Lean. Premixed and Prevaporized combustion system is developed. The third concept, applying the Rich burn Quick Quench Lean burn combustion seems to lead to a smaller technical risk than LPP still providing a substantial amount in NOX reduction work in the Interim Phase of the programme showed that Double Annular technology can offer an overall NOx reduction of 30% to 40% relative to conventional Single Annular Combustor. For the first time, LPP systems have been tested during the Interim Phase at pressure levels up to 20 bar (small engines) and 17 bar for large engines respectively, without experiencing any damage by operating with excellent homogeneity providing extraordinarily low NOx emission rates (more than 90% of NOx reduction at 7 bar/6:50K) RQL combustors were tested up to 40 bar and 900K entry temperature reaching a N'Ox r BE97-4420",1,1

This will give input to policy decisions.  An evaluation of the regional economic dimensions of change in a Community context. It will involve analysis of existing trends in land-use management caused by developments and changes in economy, technology and society. It will then look at implications for changes in water use caused by land-use changes, and the ways of preventing increasing land abandonment.

213,106614,No,Advanced Measurement and Control of Exciton Diffusion for Next Generation Organic Semiconductor Optoelectronics,"There is great interest in organic materials with semiconducting electronic properties.  This arises from both a scientific point of view (how can a plastic be a semiconductor?) and a technological point of view as these materials can be used to make light-emitting diodes, lasers and solar cells.  The performance of all these devices is strongly affected by exciton diffusion, a process that is little studied or understood (particularly compared with charge transport) largely because of the lack of reliable measurement techniques.  The purpose of this proposal is to make a breakthrough in the measurement, understanding and control of exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors, and so create a new generation of materials and devices with enhanced performance due to control of exciton diffusion.  The key elements of the study are first to develop and validate advanced measurements of exciton diffusion.  This will open up the whole topic of exciton “transport” and provide the tools for us (and others) to explore the physics of exciton diffusion and how it is affected by a range of factors relating to the structure of the materials and how they are processed.  The following phase of work will use information about the main factors affecting exciton diffusion to develop strategies for controlling it.  A particular challenge is to increase exciton diffusion which will then lead to improved efficiency of organic solar cells.  We aim to address this both by applying the structure-property relations we develop and by developing directional exciton transfer, including quantum coherent energy transfer.  This is an unconventional approach to improving organic solar cells, which could not only improve their efficiency, but also greatly simplify their structure, leading to a breakthrough in their manufacturability. Control of exciton diffusion arising from the proposed research will also lead to strategies for increasing the efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes and lasers.",0,0
849,74394,No,SUPERCONDUCTIVITY - FERROMAGNETISM INTERPLAY in NANOSTRUCTURED HYBRID SYSTEMS,"We propose to launch an exhaustive investigation of hybrid Nan structures incorporating super conducting (S) and ferromagnetic (F) metal components. We will investigate experimentally and theoretically fundamental quantum electronic and magnetic phenomena occurring in superconductor and ferromagnetic-based hybrids, dynamic and kinetic transport effects, the processes of spin filtering and spin injection, and the possibility of coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin. In the course of this work, we shall master the metal-ferromagnetic interface technology, and develop techniques for manufacturing micron and sub micron-size circuits. The exciting new feature of S-F hybrid structures consists of the competition between ferromagnetism and superconductivity, representing two antitheses in condensed matter physics, which is of abiding interest in fundamental and applied materials science and occurs naturally only in few exotic materials. Now we aim to produce it artificially in structured-structured composite materials, such as S-films with embedded magnetic clusters-clusters, in S-F-S and F-S-F multi-layers, and in sub-micron size hybrid circuits. The mutual proximity between superconductivity and ferromagnetism, possible as these are brought together within a nanometre scale, will create new quality with not yet known quantum ground state and kinetic properties. In the long term, new emergent quantum and macroscopic phenomena will be found that are not observed in bulk materials, only in such artificial structures. Understanding of the physics involved will be combined with the search for novel guiding principles for the next generation magnetic memory and, in the long term, enhancing the material and device functionalities via combining the specific properties of ferromagnetism and superconductors.",0,0
730,18126,No,Management in a Distributed Application and Service Environment,"MIDAS addresses the management of distributed OSI application services and the underlying communications services. Its first goal is to develop products in the area of Managing Applications (MAs) which solve genuine management problems in working networks with real users. These MAs will be specified by the operators of the networks. Management will be based on the ISO standards for network management. The MAs will be developed with the aid of platforms developed within the MIDAS project.  In order to ensure that the project's work has wide applicability, the results will be demonstrated in two contrasting situations. In the first, the target will be a public administration network operated by one of the industrial partners. Here the users work in public administration and employ OSI applications such as X.400 mail and X.500. In the second, the target will be a set of workstations connected to an office LAN via the public ISDN. Here the user will be homeworkers engaged in various office activities. In addition to conventional OSI applications, novel applications involving images and computer conferencing will be used. At the start of the project a requirements analysis work package, led by the operators of the public administration network, will determine the MAs to be developed for the two networks. Close attention will be paid to the need for management to take a global view of a distributed application. The opportunity of using AIP techniques to this end will be evaluated. The MAs developed will allow the control of applications and communications as well as merely monitoring their behaviour.   The systems being managed (the Managed Systems or MSs) must present an external view that accords with the requirements of the OSI management model. This view encompasses both the protocols to be used when management information is transferred as well as the nature and structure of the management information itself. The development of managed versions for X.400, X.500 and ISDN products is the second important goal of MIDAS. A subsidiary goal of the project will be the implementation of these platforms.   In order to operate successfully, support services must be available. OSI directory services will be used to store static configuration information about the networks, the user and the MAs. The proper interaction between the directory and the MAs will be carefully considered. Security services are vital, as it is intended that management information should be securely held and that control actions should be properly authorised. OSI directory and X.500 security services are available as a result of other ESPRIT projects.   Two extended demonstrators, one in the field of public administration and the other in the area of home working, with both involving external users, will be established as the culmination of the project.",0,0

Development of an improved 'modular' wind farm code.   Development of a wake gust model to be used in time-domain structural load calculations for wind farm applications.  Existing wake models have been improved and extended with respect to turbulence, ground effects and wake interference.Results from computational calculations have been compared with measurements. The results look promising.  The combination of the vortex particle model with the kaffa epsilon model is in the final stage.  A concept for the structure of the new modular wind farm code has been made. Basic ideas to define various modules have been outlined. The wake is divided in 3 regions: the rotor region; the near wake region; the far wake region. The modules consist of functional relations based on the improved wake models and of data bases filled by means of measured results and/or calculated results of the improved wake models. One module describes the turbulence characteristics. It seems that the turbulence intensity in the near wake can be described as a function of the velocity deficit and the undisturbed mean wind speed.  The evaluation of existing gust models has finished. A scheme for a combined gust model using the best parts of the original gust models in order to arrive at a wake gust model has been made. The project is divided in three parts: coordination, wake and wind farm modelling and gust modelling. In this way a clear distinction can be made among the various activities. Special attention has been paid to a clear definition of the various tasks to be carried out by each participant, including a specification of the input requirements and resultant output of each task. Three project meetings will be held at crucial moments during the project. In these meetings the results of preceding activities will be discussed and succeeding activities will be agreed upon.   Wake and Wind Farm Modelling   In order to arrive at an enhanced wind farm model, able to calculate accurate estimates of the total power output and turbulence properties in wind farms, the underlying flow phenomena will be studied in detail. Advanced wake flow models will be used to investigate the effects relevant to wake flow. Models of different Participants will be combined in order to arrive at a better description of the near and the far wake. Investigation of the development of turbulence in the wake as well as the interaction of multiple wakes. Results of the advanced wake models will be used to develop simplified modules which may be incorporated in the enhanced wind farm model. The wake models and simplified modules will be evaluated and validated using existing experimental data and experimental data made  available by the related Joule-Project Full-Scale Measurements on Wind-Turbine Arrays.   Gust Models   Existing gust models will be evaluated. One gust model will be selected to serve as a basis for development of a wake gust model. The possibility to incorporate specific wake characteristics into this latter gust model will be investigated. Wind farm wind statistics will be translated into gust speeds and gust amplitudes typical for the situation in a wind turbine wake to be applied for design wind load calculations of wind turbines. Measured data and analysis results from related JOULE Projects will be used to  develop a final wake gust model. In order to tune the activities as much as possible to the specific requirements of future users, representative  bodies involved in wind farm development and wind turbine design within Europe will be consulted during the project definition and progress evaluation activities.",0,0

The scale and urgency of the problem is largely recognised and several major initiatives have been developed to deal with pollution control and abatement. In Europe, the EC Water Framework Directive require that surface, coastal and underground waters meet; good status; within all the member states by 2015. With only 10 years to go, initiatives to develop cost-effective and sustainable water remediation technologies are crucially needed.  The proposed project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel permeable barrier technology; the Bio Fe-Clay Barrier; which could be a lower-cost and more sustainable alternative to other technologies for the remediation of diverse groundwater contaminations, including pesticides, chlorinate daliphatics and nitroaromatics. The proposed technology is cutting-edge in that, for the first time ever, it will involve the in situ microbial Fe-reduction of barrier clay materials and will take advantage of the unique ability of reduced Fe-clays in promoting the degradation of organic compounds. Feasibility experiments under both laboratory and field-like conditions will be conducted within state-of-the-art facilities, using high-tech equipments and a multi-disciplinary approach, combining mineralogy, microbiology and soil mechanics.

In the context of urgent transition towards carbon-free energy, natural gas is greener than coal or oil, and carbon-neutral sources like biogas or renewable energy power-to-gas arise as promising options. At the same time, decentralized production presents advantages as heat is not wasted and there is no loss in the electricity transportation. Integrated into smart grids, decentralized productions increases the global efficiency of the energy production. FLAMINCO is an ultra-efficient gas heat pump consisting of an innovative micro combined heat and power –micro CHP- unit, a state-of-the-art heat pump and a condensing water boiler. It may be powered with natural gas, biogas or H2 and gas mixtures. It provides up to 135 kWth. A smart control system makes the three involved technologies always work in the most cost-efficient way, ending with a yearly average efficiency of 160%. This system is ready for integration into smart grids and considers temporary costs and carbon intensity of electricity to decide the working mode. FLAMINCO targets 15-20 apartment buildings. End-users may reduce gas use by 30%, what immediately translates into economic savings (4,600 €/yr) and CO2 reduction with a fast payback of just 4 years.

One of the most important market trends is the use of new bio-based ingredients obtained by environment-friendly extraction processes and testing methods. Of particular importance is the re-cycling and valorization of agro-food industry by-products as feedstocks for the isolation of bioactive molecules. The BIORICE project aims to fill the gap of knowledge of the involved SMEs on rice protein by-product pre-treatment, peptide isolation and relative bioactivity and safety testing. In particular, BIORICE research activities will produce added value bioactive ingredients (semi-purified digestates and small molecular weight peptides) starting from protein by-products contained in the processing water of the rice starch production stream. The protein by-products will be pre-treated via biotechnological approaches (enzymatic proteolysis, microbial treatments) and different small molecular weight (lower than 15 kDa) peptides will be isolated by means of innovative eco-sustainable and not degrading techniques. A new method for in vitro evaluation of the skin sensitization potency will be developed so that the products will be tested without using laboratory animals.

78,185967,Yes,Strategic Clean Technology Policies for Climate Change,"Renewable energy targets and support programs form a major part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the E.U. and abroad—but not without controversy. Recent studies indicate that the implied abatement costs from European renewable energy policies are significantly higher than corresponding ETS allowance prices. Furthermore, the generators that benefit from these policies already operate in a market subject to the ETS cap, meaning that additional abatement via renewable energy can be offset by reduced effort among other covered units.  Overlapping policy instruments can be justified by overlapping policy goals. In addition to domestic emissions abatement, stated rationales for renewable energy support include promoting technological innovation, exports, employment and energy security. One question is whether the extra cost of abatement from renewables over other alternatives is outweighed by these other benefits. Another is whether green industrial policy and trade promotion is consistent with WTO obligations.  I propose to explore the value of clean technology programs above and beyond their emissions abatement potential, with a focus on innovation. The approach will blend economic theory, modeling, and empirical techniques and extend the literatures on environmental policy and induced innovation, directed technical change, and strategic trade policies. The methods will address key questions for interdisciplinary research in trade law and the environment. To what extent do clean energy technologies exhibit stronger external benefits than other innovating technologies, and to what extent do popular clean technology policies bring forth those benefits? Of particular interest is the potential role of international spillovers in clean energy technologies as a justification for aggressive renewable energy support, and whether the economics indicate that WTO law should make more room for green industrial policy.",1,1
600,105081,No,Understanding Symbiotic Diversity: aCandidate Gene approach,"Interaction between plant root and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is a crucial symbiosis in nature and present in almost all crops. In addressing plant responses to stress, this proposal shifts the focus from the host to the symbiotic unit. By recognizing symbiosis to be a major player in evolution, the interplay is valued between the adaptive regulation of host and symbionts metabolisms.  Using wild carrots, their AM community and the alternatieve oxidase (AOX) candidate gene, the researcher will address the prediction that AOX gene polymorphisms are drivers in interlinked plant and AM fungi evolution. This project studies - for the first time - the interaction between plant and AM in natural ecosystems using a crucial candidate marker, followed by experiments exploring driving effects of evolution. The research will lead to better understanding of evolutionary processes that shape the composition of the symbiosis and of the benefit of diversity to crop productivity. The approach is interdisciplinary: physiology, ecology and evolutionary genetic methodologies. There is high commercial interest in appropriate breeding strategies based on efficient genotype-mycorrhiza as they can promote, a.o., a more sustainable use of phosphorus in crops and minimize associated biodiversity losses, and mitigate the impacts of global climate change on agricultural and native plant communities.  A similar proposal was previously submitted in 2011-CIG which achieved overall high scores. The present proposal addresses the referees’ comments, which mainly concerned better explanation of the methodologies and their feasibility.

The proposed system will extract heat from the autoclave to match existing cooling rates that are specified by material manufacturers. The heat will be stored in a specially designed thermal store at the highest enthalpy possible to maximise opportunities for re-use. We aim to reduce initial energy use in the autoclave by at least 25% through reduction of the autoclave headspace and recover 50% of the energy wasted at the end of the autoclave processing stage for re-use in other energy intensive heating processes such as the post cure process. In addition, we aim to recover compressed air (with its intrinsic compression energy and heat from the autoclave) and heat from the air compressors that create the 7 to 10 bar pressure and integrate this with the system.  Our proposed technology would have a major impact on end-users and the environment. In summary we could achieve energy savings of 639,000 kWhr per system p.a; equating to €66,000 in end-user increased gross profit potential per system p.a. and would reduce CO2 emissions by 318 Tonnes p.a.",0,0
42,197915,Yes,Deciphering the greenhouse gas record in deepest ice using continuous sublimation extraction / laser spectrometry,"The recent anthropogenic global warming makes a detailed understanding of coupling processes between climate and biogeochemical cycles of pressing importance. The atmospheric archive of air bubbles enclosed in polar ice cores provides the only direct record of greenhouse gas changes in the past, and the key to understanding the related changes in biogeochemical cycles and climate/greenhouse gas feedbacks.   Crucial questions about greenhouse gas variability on very short (decadal) and very long (orbital) time scales still remain open. To answer these questions, the ice core community has proposed new drilling projects with the goal of nearly doubling the time span of the available ice core record to the last 1.5 million years and of covering the entire Holocene greenhouse gas record in unprecedented decadal resolution. These goals have one thing in common: due to glacier flow most of this record will only be found in a very thin layer in the bottom-most ice of the cores. Completely new analytical approaches are needed to unlock the atmospheric archive in this ice in order to gain high-resolution, high-precision measurements, while at the same time drastically reducing sample consumption compared to established techniques.  The deepSLice project will make such a step change in ice core analytics by developing a novel coupled Continuous Sublimation Extraction-Quantum Cascade Laser Spectrometer system. It will allow us to simultaneously measure CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations as well as the isotopic composition of CO2 on air samples of only 1-2 ml at standard pressure and temperature, reducing the required sample size by one order of magnitude. This non-destructive analysis will make it also possible for the complete air sample to be recollected after analysis and used for other measurements. This method will be applied to existing and new ice cores in order to study past changes in greenhouse gases and the underlying biogeochemical cycles in unparalleled detail.",1,1

574,35597,No,High temperature superconducting rapid single flux quantum logic,"The consortium proposes to: (1) Establish a common design base for these circuits. (2) Develop and demonstrate a suitable technology. (3) Develop techniques for testing and diagnosing SFQ circuits. (4) Demonstrate a complete SFQ circuit function, including interfaces to conventional CMOS technology, of up to an order of magnitude greater complexity than previous HTS circuits. (5) Recommend directions for future development and interact with other novel logic programmes through the roadmap group to provide a balanced European perspective of their potential.  To achieve the above objectives four partners propose to join forces. The project will be led by the University of Twente (The Netherlands). The other partners are Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), the Defence Research Agency (UK) and Thomson/CSF Laboratoire Central de Recherches (France). These groups are amongst the leaders in Europe in HTS circuit technology and have state of the art capabilities. Their technologies are complementary to maximise the chances of success. Only the best of these technologies will be selected to make the demonstrator.   The project is part of the Nano-Scale Integrated Circuits  It is expected that CMOS will begin to reach its technological or financial limits in the first decade of the next century. Its deficiencies will first appear as bottlenecks where there is no alternative to high speed. This project is aimed at developing the technology to fill these bottlenecks. Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) has strengths complementary to CMOS : it is capable of extremely high speed at very low power dissipation. Typical speed power products for SFQ are less than 10-17J, while state of the art CMOS might attain 10-14 to 10-13J. CMOS will undoubtedly continue to improve, but probably only has one additional order of magnitude of improvement left. Against these performance advantages must be set the burden of cooling, which will limit early use to critical components that leverage overall system performance.  The architecture which allows the very high speeds is particularly well suited to data local operations such as are common in communications and signal processing. It is often predicted that the first major bottleneck in the capabilities of conventional electronics will be in packet switching networks; this function would be admirably suited to implementation in SFQ. It is worth pointing out that local processing is the consequence of the high clock speed, not the technology; it is highlighted for SFQ simply because it is the first logic family to operate so fast.  Before HTS-SFQ can become a commercial proposition, the fabrication technology must be developed and the design methods established. The aim of this project is to improve the technology to the point where a fairly complex demonstrator circuit can be made. This demonstration will be a major step in showing the industrial potential of the technology.

27,94534,Yes,THE CHANGING ARCTIC AND SUB-ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT: A RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAMME ON MARINE BIOTIC INDICATORS OF RECENT CLIMATE CHANGES IN THE HIGH LATITUDES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC,"The main aim of the CASE Initial Training Network Programme is to train the next generation of European paleoclimate scientists via state-of-the-art training in marine biotic proxies and modelling of past climate changes. It will be implemented through a joint research project aiming to describe and identify the mechanisms and impacts of recent environmental changes in the Nordic Seas. The composition of the consortium reflects the various expertises on marine biotic indicators needed to efficiently evaluate the nature and amplitudes of oceanographic and climate changes and their implications on the structure of the marine ecosystem during the present interglacial, the Holocene. The project is designed according to specific expertises of each network participant and the contribution of associated industry partners, hereby providing an ideal setting for training actions to the benefit of early stage researchers (ESR). CASE will therefore address the following key scientific objectives: 1, Advance our fundamental understanding on the impact of various natural climatic forcing factors in high northern latitudes during the Holocene. 2, Obtain a more complete knowledge on Holocene natural variability of physical parameters affecting ecosystem processes and structure in the Nordic Seas. 3, Improve our understanding and quantification of Holocene changes in ocean circulation and climate variability of the Arctic and Subarctic domains. 4, Expand our knowledge of previous Holocene polar amplifications of warming. 5, Gain fundamental knowledge of the impact of global warming beyond the range of Holocene natural variability over the last 150 years on the Nordic Seas environmental system.",1,1
272,75367,No,Nucleic Acid Based Nanostructures,"The aim of the proposal is to develop a nanoscale toolbox to create smart materials based on the use of natural and artificial nucleic acids. Nanometer sized particles and single (bio)molecules will be connected with restricted and well defined placing to each other and to surfaces. Focus of the proposed STREP is to develop basic building blocks that are capable to arrange by self organisation facilitated by molecular recognition. Complexes generated by nucleic acid directed assembly may be non-periodic and non-regular to combine complex features. Examples of application of such material are incorporated in the project, to direct the development and show the potential of the long term-innovation introduced by NUCAN. Fields of application are bioanalytics, ph armaceutical receptor screening and nanoelectronics. Besides the information content and their dominant role in all life sciences, esp. genetics, nucleic acids have unique properties as polymers and as macromolecules. Both the addressability of each unique site within a given sequence on a nucleic acid strand by base recognition as well as the chemical homogeneity of the polymer through the repeating unit of the backbone makes nucleic acids ideal molecules for the construction of highly ordered but non-peri odic supramolecular entities. The aim of the proposal is to develop nanometer scale constructs made of nucleic acids in one, two and three dimensions. Basic principles and development of enabling technologies, detection and production processes are in the focus of the proposal to prepare a basis for applications of nucleic acid based nanoconstructs.",0,0
326,35463,No,STRATEGIC PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOR PRODUCT INNOVATION,"New products are the focal point of competition and the lifeblood of successful companies. Developing high quality products more efficiently and effectively tops the agenda for senior managers around the world. Yet Product Innovation (PI) is a risky and costly business. As development timescales and customer satisfaction become ever more critical, organisational and management skills become more vital. The PROMISE project therefore aimed to assist European SMEs benefit from the implementation of project management approaches and procedures which have been proven to enhance management of product creation, development and commercialisation (the product innovation life-cycle), thus increasing both their global competitiveness and capacity for growth.  The project involved 13 participants: 3 consultancy companies, 3 intermediary organisations, 6 SMEs (end users) and a professional society, targeting to improve sales through PI of at least 5% across SME partners and improve of 10% in key areas such as cost reduction, time to market and reduction in risk. In addition, one project launch workshop took place in each of the end-user countries and one pan-European launch took place with system support tools available for demonstration. Information on project results disseminated to 500 SMEs (or other intermediary type organisations that can themselves assist further diffusion).  The project was completed in several steps:  (i) completing the identification of critical success factors (i.e. the approaches, methods, practices and specific procedures) related to project management that impacted most strongly on PI in larger and multi-national companies and where appropriate in successful smaller enterprises (best practice in larger companies may not always be suitable for transfer even with adaptation to SMEs) (ii) defining which of the above already best meet SME needs and therefore have optimum potential for widespread transfer and adaptation into European SMEs (iii) working from the above, to provide a blueprint format together with associated tools (the toolkit) to assist SMEs access and implement a series of project management approaches and procedures (iv) transferring, piloting, testing, and evaluating the effect of implementation of the prototype toolkit in 6 end-user SMEs across Europe (across a number of manufacturing sectors), with pre-determined performance variables built in, so that benefits of use can be proved and quantified (v) diffusing results and outputs to the broadest possible pan-European audience of SMEs, through comprehensive dissemination and exploitation strategies.",0,0
567,185405,No,"""""The Emergence of Relativism -- Historical, Philosophical and Sociological Perspectives""""","'Although philosophers as well as scientists are frequently involved in debates over the threat or promise of relativism, there has been little detailed historical, philosophical or sociological work on its emergence and early development. This project addresses this lacuna in a fundamentally new way: it investigates the history of relativism in the German-speaking world (and to some degree, beyond) in the 19th and early 20th century across several disciplines--philosophy, physiology, psychology, history, linguistics, theology, law, linguistics, anthropology, sociology--using integrated historical, sociological and philosophical methods.  The main objectives of this project are thus to:  (1) retrace the intellectual history of the emergence of important forms of relativism (and the counterpart versions of anti-relativism) in 19th and early-20th-century German-speaking philosophy and science;  (2) explain some key junctures of this intellectual history in sociological terms; and  (3) critically evaluate the central arguments for and against relativism as they evolved in the period under investigation, and as they have been developed further in more recent discussions.  Accordingly, the overall project has three main perspectives: Intellectual History of Philosophy and the Sciences, Sociology of Knowledge, and Philosophy.  Methodologically, the project will be innovative in building on the tensions between these three perspectives. E.g. philosophical studies on causal explanation will be used to sharpen sociological or historical analyses. And these analyses will in turn suggest new forms of philosophical reflection on the determinants of intellectual content.  The results of this project are bound to benefit all of the mentioned disciplines in which debates over relativism loom large. Some of the results will be of significance also to wider social debates over, say, multiculturalism or pluralism (themes beyond the immediate focus of the project).'""",0,0
25,110428,Yes,Advanced concepts and tools for renewable energy supply of IT Data Centres,"The interest in the carbon footprint of Data Centres (DCs) has become more urgent with the rapid increase in Cloud computing, High-Powered Computing, and the vast growth in Internet use, and of DCs as key enablers of this paradigm. However, whereas energy efficiency is necessary to reduce ecological impact of DCs, it is not enough. In addition, the carbon emissions of DCs are greatly influenced by the energy sources used, the operation of the DC, the connection to energy infrastructures in our cities and integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Planners, managers, investors, owners and designers of DCs lack the necessary tools capable of evaluating the environmental performance and the share of RES in the emerging concept of Net Zero Energy DCs.The main objective of the RenewIT is to develop a simulation tool to evaluate the energy performance of different technical solution integrating RES in several European climate regions. The public RenewIT tool will be implemented in a user-friendly web interface helping actors from both the energy and IT sectors to reduce the carbon footprint of planned DCs in the horizon of 2030. The tool is based on selected meta-models extracted from advanced dynamic simulation models of challenging energy concepts for renewable energy supply of DCs.A set of challenging energy concepts will be developed in the framework of the project under an holistic approach integrating the following technical solutions: management of the IT load following 'green' objectives, low-energy air-conditioning systems, solar cooling, interaction with district heating and cooling networks, re-use of heat, optimal use of heat and cold storage, and integration in smart grids. The technical systems emerging from the energy concepts are modelled in dynamic simulation tools creating a family of new components which will be integrated in the Green DC library of components as an exploitable output of the project. Harmonised metrics able to rank the energy performance of DCs will be developed and implemented in the software tools as a result of co-ordinated work with relevant standardisation organisations, industry bodies, and other European projects. In addition, these harmonised metrics will be part of a high-quality monitoring system to monitor DCs integrating renewables.A validation process will be developed, in close collaboration with four DCs in Southern Europe and four DCs in Northern Europe, which will exchange continuous feedback with the technical developers throughout the project. The validation process will be based on built case studies for live DCs as the means of testing the robustness and the end-user applicability both of the developed technical energy concepts and of the simulation software tools.The project outputs will be widely disseminated throughout the project lifetime, through scientific and industry publications, web site and social media, and attendance at relevant conferences and industry forums.<br/><br/>",1,1

30,38867,Yes,Polar Vortex Change,"Polar Vortex Change (PVC) is a proposal by six European research groups to address the climate variability and changes of the Arctic polar vortex. Polar vortex is characterised by ozone loss and temperature extremes, but also by large interannual variability. Polar vortex is an important component of hemispheric climate and changes in it can significantly affect high and mid-latitudes. They also tell about the advancement of climate change.  The potential long-term changes in the dynamics and chemistry of the Arctic polar vortex have not been studied in a concentrated manner. Instead, ozone has been in focus. Coordinated exploration of the best data sets offers the possibility for answers on the advancement of climate change and its implications on high and middle latitudes of the northem hemisphere. PVC has been designed for this purpose. PVC will quantify changes in the Arctic polar vortex dynamics and chemistry due to long-term changes in temperature, ozone and other stratospheric constituents. In PVC, a combination of extensive data analysis and modelling is applied on the best long-term data on the Arctic polar vortex to analyse for natural variability, long-term changes and trends:  - European Arctic ozone soundings from late 1980's to present - ECMWF reanalysis data for 1979-1994 and operational analyses since - FU Berlin and NCEP analyses  - TOMS v7 and ground-based column ozone data  - UARS, SSU, SAM satellite-data  There are four Work Packages (2 data analysis and 2 modelling ones) in PVC, in which advanced tools are used:  - Use of transformed coordinate systems, with respect to Potential Vorticity,low temperatures, polar vortex edge, time, potential temperature, inlong-term ozone change analysis (WP 1)  - Analysis of Lagrangian in-situ data in year-to-year chemical ozone lossanalysis (WP 1)  - State of the art GCM modelling of vortex dynamics and outflow with modemadvection schemes (WP 2)  - Contour advection modelling of vortex outflow (WP 2)  - State of the art 2-D and 3-D decadal chemical modelling of naturalvariability, trace gases and heterogeneous processes, using updatedemission scenarios and observed trends (WP 3)  - State of the art radiative transfer modelling using observed and modelledtrace gas, temperature and aerosol changes (WP 4)  - In additioni intensive data analysis is done on polar vortex natural andchanging life cycle and temperature extremes (WP 2), using high-qualityhomogenised meteorological data.  The main study period of PVC is late 1970's to present in the case of ozone column trends, late 1970's to present in the case of vortex dynamics and chemistry changes, the same for the radiative forcing changes and late 1980's to present in case of ozone profile changes. The earlier decades (1950's to 1970's) are studied to better understand the natural variability of the polar vortex. Parts of these data have been analysed earlier, but only for shorter time spans in case studies or for specific winters. Successive shorter timespan studies have been made with evolving methods and data, as well as with data from evolving instrumentation and processing. PVC, on the other hand, will perform a thorough, coordinated analysis of the available, homogenised long-temm data sets.  PVC contributes to Area 1.1, Topics 1.1.3 and 1.1.1 (Climate variability, simulation of climate and prediction of climate change; Basic processes in the climate system) and Area 1.2, Topic 1.2.1.1 (Stratospheric chemistry and depletion of the ozone layer) of the Workprogramme.
