727,202656,No,Automatization of perturbative QCD at very high orders.,"In recent months, we broke new ground in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics computing for the first time a physical cross-section of a hadron collider process - Higgs production - at the fourth order in the strong coupling constant expansion. This breakthrough  improved the perturbative precision of a fundamental cross-section by a factor of four,  paving the way for a very precise testing of the Standard Model theory against LHC data.    The aim of our proposal is to fully automate all calculations which are needed for LHC and future collider physics at similarly high perturbative orders. Our work will improve the precision of theoretical predictions across the spectrum of LHC phenomenology, matching or superseding the accuracy of  experimental measurements. In turn, we will be able to draw firm conclusions about the validity of theories which aspire to describe nature at TeV energies and search confidently for signals of new physics through precision measurements at the LHC.",0,0

850,84293,No,Families and the corporation in European Capitalism,"The project takes a number of long-lived family firms in different national contexts (France, Germany, Italy) and compares them with similar firms in the UK and US, some of which no longer are family firms. It examines the effect of regulation, fiscal systems, and law and inheritance patterns on corporate development; and investigates the efficiency of family firms. It will challenge the view that there is a one- way trajectory from small- scale family owned business to large joint stock corporations in which professional management is separated from a widely dispersed ownership.  A large number of example in fact go the other way, from family firm to joint-stock corporation, but then back to control through non-listed family-dominated holding companies. Are there particular technologies or levels of capital intensitity that are most likely to be the focus of family business? What are the consequences for the overall course of economic development and change in the European setting?  This issue is particularly important in the discussion of what are often held to be the peculiarities of continental European or 'Rhineland' capitalism, and the current debate about its strengths and weaknesses. China and India, where there is a great deal of dynamic family enter prise, are interested in drawing lessons from the European model. The theme of the peculiarities of European corporate development has also become an important part of the discussion about how European social and legal structures adapt to globalisation.",0,0
63,94496,Yes,Transmission system operation with large penetration of Wind and other renewable Electricity sources in Networks by means of innovative Tools and Integrated Energy Solutions,"A group of 6 Transmission System Operators (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany The Netherlands and Spain) with 2 generator companies, 5 manufacturers and research organisations, propose 6 demonstration projects to remove, in 3 years, several barriers which prevent the electric system from welcoming more wind electricity, and wind electricity from contributing more to the electric system. The full scale demonstrations aim at proving the benefits of novel technologies (most of them available from manufacturers) coupled with innovative system management approaches. The contribution of wind energy to the system will show how aggregated wind farms can provide system services (voltage and frequency control) in Spain. The aggregation of wind farms with flexible generation and loads will be demonstrated in Denmark using a scalable IT platform developed by a generator. Increasing the flexibility of transmission networks will be tested in Belgium (existing sensors and coordinated power flow control devices avoiding possible large scale instabilities induced by wind farms in the CWE region) and in Spain (dynamic wind power evacuation capacity using real-time computations based on short-term generation forecasts and use of a mobile Overload Line Controller). Off-shore wind farms are addressed from a security viewpoint. Secure HVDC meshed networks will be validated in France using simulations and full scale experiments of two different HVDC circuit breaker technologies. Off-shore wind farm shut downs under stormy conditions will be demonstrated in Denmark using the world largest off-shore wind farm with balancing power provided by the Norwegian hydro capacities through a HVDC link. The experimental results will be integrated into European impact analyses to show the scalability of the solutions: routes for replication will be provided with benefits for the pan European transmission network and the European electricity market as soon as 2014, in line with the SET plan objectives.",1,1
711,193528,No,Water-mass transformation and Pathways In The Weddell Sea: uncovering the dynamics of a global climate chokepoint from In-situ measurements,"Deep water formed around the Antarctic continent drives the world ocean circulation. 50-70% of this deep water is formed within only about 10% of the Antarctic circumpolar band: the Weddell Sea. Subtle changes in the circulation of the Weddell Sea can lead to major changes in floating ice-shelves, with critical implications for global sea-level, the production of deep water and the global ocean overturning circulation. Despite these critical climate implications, the Antarctic shelf circulation remains poorly understood.   I propose an ambitious project at the crossroads of experimental and numerical oceanography. By drawing on the strengths of each discipline I will explore the regional water-mass pathways in the Weddell Sea: an unchartered cornerstone for understanding the polar ocean circulation and its links to global climate. A key issue facing climate scientists will be addressed: “What sets the tridimensional water-mass structure and pathways in the Weddell Sea and modulates the flow of deep waters between the Antarctica ice-shelves and the global ocean circulation?”  To address this question I propose to investigate several key aspects of the Weddell Sea system: the dynamical forcing of the Weddell gyre and its response to atmospheric variability; the forcing and the circulation on the continental shelf and its interaction with the gyre; and the time-scale and mixing associated with bottom water sinking along the continental shelf. WAPITI approaches these objectives through a series of innovations, including (i) an ambitious field experiment to investigate the shelf circulation and processes, (ii) a powerful conceptual framework applied for the first time to a realistic eddy-resolving model of the Weddell gyre, and (iii) a novel instrument that will be developed to directly observe the sinking of deep water into the abyssal ocean for the first time. Collectively, the project will contribute a new insight into global climate feedbacks.",0,0
576,196451,No,Reconfigurable silicon architecture for connected intelligent lighting.,"Lighting accounts for 19% of energy consumption in the developed world. However low energy lighting technologies are rapidly replacing the traditional incandescent technology and by far the most rapidly growing low energy lighting technology today is LED. The LED lighting market was worth $16.5B in 2013, is growing at a CAGR in excess of 16% and is projected to continue growing at this rate through to 2018 when the market is projected to be worth $33.5B.  Not only is lighting moving towards more energy efficient technologies such as LED, but the way in which lighting is used is also undergoing a dramatic evolution. Lighting is becoming increasingly “connected” and increasingly “intelligent” and it is this growing market that Ikon Semiconductor aims to address with this proposal.  The target customers for the outcome of this project are manufacturers of LED lighting power supply systems. The project aims to develop an optimum re-configurable silicon architecture for “connected intelligent lighting” systems for use in smart buildings including residential, commercial and industrial. It will enable a single highly configurable chip-set solution with an optimum hardware/software co-design to operate with any wireless or wired communications protocol and will allow the developers of advanced lighting power supply systems to re-configure their design to address a broad range of applications. This will replace the currently available disparate range of fixed-function solutions and will enable reduced cost and time-to-market for our target customers. Such a solution has global commercial potential.  In this Phase-1 SME instrument feasibility study we aim to use both new and existing end-user advisor relationships to carry out a market validation and an economic viability analysis. It is also our intention to submit a business plan for a Phase 2 SME Instrument during 2015.",1,0

269,93959,No,Competitive Advantage for Process-intensive industries by SCheduling with Heuristics-EnhanceD simulation & optimisation,"A competitive weapon for companies in process-intensive industries such as the chemical industry, is effective mastery of supply chain management from raw material to end product so as to improve efficiency, effectiveness, &amp; profitability. However, in flow scheduling, the human operator can be overwhelmed by the complexity of the problem. CAP-SCHED involves developing a new intelligent scheduling system for companies in continuous/semi-continuous process industries. The innovative solution uses a multi-agent framework to combine 2 existing approaches which, individually, are inadequate to improve scheduling. However, combining both approaches offers significant improvements to implement more profitable solutions to scheduling problems, with better account taken of constraints. The 2 approaches are: 1. Simulation through trial &amp; error: * The scheduler instructs the system to calculate all material flows in terms of quantity &amp; quality from up- to down-stream throughout the plant; * If infeasibility occurs (e.g. capacity limitation…) then the planner readjusts parameters in trial &amp; error mode to reach a feasible solution. and 2. Algorithmic constraint solving: * the problem is represented as a mathematical model &amp; the system attempts a solution, helped by heuristic guesses so as to guide the search algorithm via domain knowledge. The new idea is to allow full interaction with the system via a Graphical User Interface as if running in simulation mode, &amp; to translate instructions, when the value of an operating parameter (or the starting date of an event…) is fixed, in terms of constraints imposed in the mathematical model. Thus, the person responsible for scheduling can choose to fix variable values, and to let the system find those left free so as to reach a feasible solution. Overall, the solution will drastically reduce the need for multiple planning/scheduling loops so as to achieve a consistently optimised solution with improved profitability.",0,0
873,16936,No,Data Acquisition and Communication Techniques and their Assessment for Road Transport,"The objective of this project is to review, analyse, develop and demonstrate basic data acquisition and communication techniques for use in RTI systems. To evaluate and assess the suitability of the techniques a regime of continuous assessment will be applied. The DACAR project focuses its efforts on the communication between vehicles and the road transport infrastructure (RTI) infrastructure. DACAR aims to assess the facilities offered by different communication techniques. 5 different types of communication techniques were envisaged. Radio sensors, infrared, microwave and cable transmission. After an initial preliminary phase of work, which included work on sensor systems and radio systems, the project now concentrates on the following areas: inductive cable systems, infrared communications (850 nm) and millimetre wave microwave communications (60 GHz). All of these techniques are essentially local in character, (ie vehicle to vehicle (except cables)), or vehicle to some sort of beacon or local communications node, as opposed to the wider area, usually public network based systems. This technical work started with a desk based state of the art and fundamental review of feasibility. Now the teams are moving on to the fabrication of prototypes for the development and support of project results by test and demonstration of equipment, designed especially for the DACAR project. The subproject concerned with the assessment technique, having established an outline assessment methodology, will refine the technique to increase its utility to the DRIVE community (ie to assess any techniques or combination thereof) and provide a feedback mechanism to the technical subprojects in order that they may be consistent in their activities. A prototype was made available on 01/09/92  The aim of the research was to devise guidelines for the design of a digital transmission system to be used with road transport informatics (RTI) systems and to provide an assessment methodology for those transmission systems. In fact, different techniques (eg microwave, infrared and inductive cable) were investigated in order to design a data transmission system for a specific RTI application. This research deals only with telecommunication issues although a full assessment of transmission techniques will taken into account a number of aspects of a political, economical and social nature.  Technically, a simplified subalgorithm has been extracted from the overall assessment procedure, and the gap existing between the technical description of proposed systems and the technical description of potential RTI applications has been demonstrated. The work attempted to devise of a common within which each transmission technique could be compared. In this way a technique independent technical description has been achieved.  The aim of the research was to investigate the potential of infrared (IR) communication techniques for use with road transport informatics (RTI) systems. The technology has several advantages. It is simple, has a low cost and a wide range of applications and can be easily integrated into existing car devices. Besides this, the infrared frequency range is not yet fully utilised and the technology can be duplicated at multiple locations. The main contribution this research to the field of infrared road vehicle communication is in the use of vertical (continuous) transmissions which form a basic system allowing several messages to be transmitted at the same time. The study included various types of road vehicle communication links which were developed and tested. Tests were carried out under laboratory conditions and on the Valeo test track in Mortefontaine near Paris. There were 5 types of tests: beam qualification; dynamic tests; lane determination; trials in changing weather conditions; measuring the limits of the data link. The purpose of the tests was to show that IR can be used to transmit short or long messages, during the passage of a vehicle under the beams at a maximum speed of 180 kilometres per second. It is possible to transmit messages from and to the roadside at transmission rater higher than 600 kilobytes per second. If it is necessary to transmit more bits, combinations of several beacons are possible. IR was found to be a good medium for dedicated short range vehicle beacon communications (DSC). The techniques considered are: sensors as data sources, radio systems, cable systems, microwave links and optical communications.  After a review and analysis of these techniques, a first global evaluation will be made of the technical and economic aspects of the different techniques. The economic assessment and the dissemination of the results to other DRIVE projects will be an important element of the projects work and supported using appropriate tools.  Eight months after its start the project will recommend which techniques justify further investigation in terms of their applicability and suitability for RTI.  The selected techniques will be further analysed, developed, tested and demonstrated, if appropriate. The evaluation and assessment of the environmental, implementation, technical and transmission aspects will be performed in parallel to the investigations into the techniques and will result in a technical assessment of the techniques to be used for RTI.  Main Deliverables:  Assessment of the different sensor and communication techniques and their implementation aspects.  Congress and seminars.  Field tests.",0,0
987,96114,No,Advanced coding techniques for mitigating error floors,"Iterative decoding algorithms for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are known to be subject to decoding failures that result in high error floors in the bit error rate performance curves. Recently, researchers became aware that the error floor was a result of a number of properties of the code's graph representation, including cycles, stopping sets, trapping sets, absorbing sets, and pseudo-codewords.  This research aims at analyzing the error floor phenomenon for these structures and developing improved code representations as well as decoder architectures to mitigate the error floor. The convolutional counterparts of LDPC codes, namely LDPC convolutional codes will also be examined in this scope. It is proposed to extend the results to the decoding of conventional codes with denser graph representations, where the error floor issue is even more severe.",0,0
611,204272,No,"Highly linear efficient technology for wireless data transmission for 4G, 5G, wifi and beyond","The aim of this project is to bring a disrupting and patented data transmission technology named Hilet (highly linear and efficient technology) to the global market of wifi-chipsets. Hilet consists of a novel and patented transmitter architecture and highly efficient power amplifiers. It beats existing solutions by far reaching high values on the most important performance scales like energy efficiency and bandwidth. It can triple energy efficiencies to 30% without sacrificing signal quality or increasing manufacturing costs.  Hilet will be licensed to leading market players. Innsystec has already completed one pilot study with the leading wifi-chipset vendor Broadcom and is about to complete another one with the leading semiconductor company Samsung. Samsung named Hilet one of the most promising future data transmission technologies for its own products. The relevant wifi-radio component and power amplifier market is 11 billion euros in size in 2018. Innsystec is targeting revenues of 30 million euros in 2020.  One of Hilet’s big advantages is that it can be flexibly adapted to all other high frequency signals like 4G or 5G. It can then be applied to all types of devices such as smartphones, laptops or wireless base stations. This will give Innsystec enormous room for revenue growth. Additionally Hilet can reduce the use of energy and CO2 emissions.   The objectives of phase 1 in tight contact with technical and business development teams of nine potential customers are: (1) Present technology to potential customers and learn from them to set future technology improvement goals, (2) Complete the business plan and detail the business model.  At the end of the innovation project (phase 2), Hilet is ready for system integration: It can be used by wifi-chipset vendors to improve the performance of its transmitters and power amplifiers significantly. It boosts Europe’s position by putting Hilet at the heart of a business which was assumed to be already lost for Europe.",0,0
262,2609,Yes,Engineering tools for wind-diesel systems,"To develop design tools for wind/diesel systems comprising  user friendly software packages. These are to cover the modelling of overall (ie logistic) performance and the dynamic modelling of systems. All code will be subject to validation against experimental data. It is intended that the programs will run on a PC or similar.  Wind Diesel is the term applied to systems in which wind energy accounts for a significant proportion of the total energy supplied such that the wind energy input has a marked impact on the operation of the diesel plant.  Previously wind diesel modelling work has been closely coupled to specific systems. The aim of this project has been to equip the design engineer with a set of tools for the general design, development, specification and assessment of wind diesel systems. A suite of models for the modelling of logistical aspects of wind diesel systems is now substantially in place. A modular dynamic model capable of modelling a very wide range of system types and configurations has also been extensively developed. Together this software should do much to bridge the gap between previous research oriented modelling and the engineers requirement for a general design tools package. In the context of this project the term wind/diesel is understood to mean an electricity supply system combining wind and diesel generation in which wind energy accounts for a significant proportion of the total energy supplied. The interaction between the major system components; wind turbines, diesel generators and energy storage, taken together with the effects of the control system, present a complex problem. A wide range of different  wind/diesel system configurations and in particular, a range of different storage technologies with contrasting technical characteristics need to be dealt with. The proposed research programme aims to accomplish its objectives by relying heavily on the work already undertaken as part of significant national programmes and on the research carried out under IEA Annex VIII, on wind/diesel systems.   A) Logistic Design Tool package   Specifically the Design Tool package will be based on existing wind/diesel models, and calculation procedures which exist in the participating countries. Before inclusion in the 'Design Package' these modules will be thoroughly validated against data to be made available from wind/diesel systems accessible to the collaboration. The various modules (national computer codes) will then be brought together in a user-friendly environment. The final package will advise the system designer which modules are appropriate to specific applications and give guidance on the strengths and  weaknesses of the different options. Results will be provided in a standard format.   B) Dynamic Model   The Dynamic system model will be based on existing models, in particular on EFI's model developed to investigate some specific system configurations. The already existing verification of the models will be reviewed, and additional verification against  measured data will be made, in order to clarify to what extent the basic equations of the models need modification and/or extension. The computer model will consist of a number of Fortran77 routines designed for use in the CYPROS/SIM simulation program package, which will reduce the actual programming effort significantly.",1,1

86,216785,Yes,Innovative Leading Edge Protection System for Wind Turbine Blades,"Wind Power has become the most promising technology as source of renewable energy in the World. In 2016, Wind Power installed more than any other form of power generation in Europe (51% of total power capacity installations), overtaking coal as the 2nd largest form of power generation capacity. Since cost reduction of each kW/h generated by Wind Power industry is one of its strategic targets, the market displays a strong tendency towards bigger wind turbines with longer blades. However, bigger rotor diameters have raised a dramatic problem regarding the durability of the blades which concerns the whole value chain of the wind power industry. Increasing blade lengths means faster linear velocity of the tip of the blade and consequently higher erosion rate of the leading edge of the blade caused by rain, hail or suspended particles. Although the lifespan of a wind turbine is calculated in 25 years, traditional medium sized wind turbines provided with current protection systems of the leading edges, required complete maintenance tasks due to deterioration of the blades at around year 10. However, recently installed turbines with \100 m diameter rotors showed problems regarding the erosion of the blades at year 2. In order to solve the erosion problem, Aerox Advanced Polymers SL, a SME specialised in developing solutions for the wind power industry, has developed an innovative leading edge protection (LEP) polymeric coating with particular mechanical and chemical properties which is able to avoid the erosion problem during the whole lifetime of the wind blade. The LEP4BLADES project aims to accelerate the commercialisation of the coating solution through the scaling-up the manufacturing and application processes, which will also require the improvement of the polymer technology and the product formulation.",1,1
832,84538,No,Physiological role of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and its implications in apoptotic cell-death signaling pathways,"The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18-kDa protein receptor, mainly found on the outer mitochondrial membrane of cells. The PBR seems to play a role in several cellular functions, including heme synthesis, steroidogenesis, DNA synthesis, cell growth and differentiation.  Recently, a role for PBR in apoptosis has also been proposed and a number of findings argue in favour of this: - over-expression of PBR has been described in a large range of human cancers; - regulation of programmed cell death has in mitochondria a check-point targeted by various conventional cancer therapies; and - PBR ligation by directed drugs, enhances apoptosis induction in many types of tumours, reversing the Bcl-2 cytoprotective effects.  These findings promoted the development of PBR targeting approaches in treatment of human cancers. Even though experimental data suggest that PBR may play a key role in various physiological and pathological processes, very little data are available on the protein-receptor cell physiology and on its role in apoptotic cell-death signalling pathways.  OBJECTIVES: Our aim is then to investigate these aspects, studying the PBR capacity to modulate and shape the cell signalling, principally in respect of the mitochondrial function.  In detail, we will: - examine the PBR expression and localization in cells of interest; - generate by molecular biology techniques recombinant probes of PBR; - investigate the result on cell signalling pathways of the PBR genetically and pharmacologically modulation; - finally, asses PBR role in respect of the apoptotic cell death and tumourigenesis.",0,0
1093,100030,No,Remote Laser Welding System Navigator for Eco & Resilient Automotive Factories,"RLW Navigator aims to develop an innovative Process Navigator to configure, integrate, test and validate applications of Remote Laser Welding (RLW) in automotive assembly addressing today's critical needs for frequently changing operating conditions and product-mix provisions. Thus, RLW Navigator will crucially serve as an enabler for future energy efficient smart factories. RLW is emerging as a promising joining technology for sheet metal assembly due to benefits on several fronts including reduced processing time, (50-75%) and decreased factory floor footprint (50%), reduced environmental impact through energy use reduction (60%), and providing a flexible process base for future model introduction or product change. Currently, RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to an acute lack of systematic ICT-based simulation methodologies to navigate their efficient application in automotive manufacturing processes. The project aims to address this by developing a Process Navigator simulation system that will deal with three key challenges thereby allowing manufacturers to utilize the advantages of the RLW system.Firstly, the most critical obstacle that currently prevents the successful implementation of RLW is the need for tight dimensional control of part-to-part gap during joining operations, essential to ensure the quality of the stitch.Secondly, the existing assembly system architecture must be reconfigured to provide the opportunity to evaluate the RLW system in terms of its feasibility to perform all required assembly tasks. This will provide crucial information about the most advantageous workstation/cell reconfiguration, which will serve as the basis for optimal robot path planning to reduce joining process time and workstation level efficiency assessment.Finally the project will develop systematic evaluation and learning methods to assess and improve the overall performance, cost-effectiveness and eco-efficiency of the RLW system.",0,0
317,87995,No,Development of Self-lubricating Nanocomposite Coatings impregnated with in-situ formed MoS2 for Tribological Applications,"Use of self-lubricated coatings in dynamic contacting parts of the system not only reduces complexity, weight, and cost to the system, but also improves the performance to a great extent by reducing friction and wear. Unlike liquid lubricants, the release of various toxic and harmful chemicals to the environment can also be avoided. So, a self-lubricated surface with a long lifetime is a promising one to meet future challenges. The most common solid lubricants are graphite and transition metals layered dichalcogenides, among which MoS2/WS2 has a great prominence. In this proposal, electrodeposition of Co-W alloys impregnated with MoS2 and WC nanoparticles will be carried out to form nanocomposite coatings by a low cost electrodeposition process. The idea is to impart high hardness and mechanical strength by WC particles for wear resistance; and self-lubrication property by MoS2 particles to a Co-W matrix. Firstly, unlike ELECTROLYTIC CO-DEPOSITION from suspensions of MoS2 nanoparticles, here, emphasis will be on the in-situ formation of MoS2 particles in the electrical double layer followed by their incorporation into Co-W alloys during electrolytic reduction process. Secondly, R&D efforts will be directed to co-deposit WC particles from suspensions along with MoS2 to make self-lubricated wear-resistant nanocomposite coatings. The detailed mechanistic study of MoS2 nucleation and growth; the surface and structural characterization of the nanocomposite coatings, wear and friction property and corrosion will be investigated to understand the structure property correlation. Thirdly, the electrodeposition of Co-W\WC\IF-MoS2 nanocomposite coatings will be carried out from electrolytic suspensions of WC and IF-MoS2 nanoparticles, and the properties will be compared with the former nanocomposites.  A special attention will be given on the onset of an implementation of this technology into industrial practice.",0,0

425,99434,No,Mechanisms coordinating chromosome replication with transcription,"'Genome stability during chromosome replication can be challenged by drugs affecting fork progression and intra-S DNA damage. While the mechanisms preserving the integrity of replicating chromosomes in response to replication stress induced by exogenous genotoxic events have been widely studied (Branzei and Foiani 2005; Branzei and Foiani 2007), those controlling fork stability under unperturbed conditions are less understood. Specialized networks control the collision between replication forks and transcription; preventing recombinogenic events. The host laboratory has contributed to elucidate the regulatory processes controlling the integrity of replication forks in response to genotoxic events and the architectural pathway protecting chromosome integrity by coordinating DNA replication and transcription. The overarching aim of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms coordinating replication fork progression across transcribed units using budding yeast as a model organism and a combination of mechanistic, genetic and genomic approaches. The first objective would be to identify and characterize the Mec1 and Rad53-mediated checkpoint mechanisms that control fork stability at transcribed regions while the second is to study whether the checkpoint influences the Top2-mediated epigenetic mechanism coordinating S phase transcription. The rationale of the present project is based on the observations that i) transcribed regions cause fork pausing and the collision between replication forks and transcription bubbles is highly coordinated ii) the replication checkpoint response controls the stability of paused forks iii) replication termination is influenced by transcription iv) oncogene activation leads to massive transcription deregulation and replication stress. The expected findings should have important implications for elucidating the cellular mechanisms preventing genome instability and those pathological processes causing genome rearrangements and cancer.'",0,0

Summary of the project  SPEECH supports the development and implementation of legislative actions by the Commission where safety and environmental protection is at stake. The project operates the well-established 'European Pressure Equipment Research Council' (EPERC), which performs Research and Development activities and in particular pre-normative and co-normative research needed to assist the development of harmonised standards useful for EU legislation. Considerable support is given to the implementation of the EC Directive on Pressure Equipment (PED 97/23/CE) that will become mandatory in member states in May 2002. With its 195 signatory organisations of industries, research institutions, inspection and governmental bodies, EPERC is fostering collaborative research, ensuring technology transfer (particularly towards SMEs) and liasing with the services of the Commission and CEN (Comité Européen de Normalisation) for the design, the manufacture and the safe operation of new pressure equipment to be placed on the market.  In 2002 SPEECH will address two new initiatives relevant to other EU policies and in particular related to the recent communication on alternative fuels for road transportation and on a set of measures to promote the use of bio fuels:  - the promotion of the use of alternative fuels for the transport sector, in particular in the field of safety of energy storage systems. Motivated by air quality concerns, alternative fuels (natural gas, bio fuels, hydrogen for fuel cells) attract considerable interest as a way to reduce urban pollution. SPEECH includes R&D activities and implementation of testing facilities for fuel storage tank technologies, a key issue for the development of vehicles powered by these fuels. - measures for the implementation of infrastructures required for safe and efficient distribution and transmission of those clean alternative fuels in order to assure their availability.  Rationale  The implementation of the Pressure Equipment Directive (PED 97/23/CE) as well as its improvement is requiring harmonised standards for pressure equipment design, manufacture and safe operation. In addition, several nuclear manufacturers are following the PED for selected nuclear reactor components (class 2 and 3). The major concern here is the harmonisation of national legislation with regard to the free movement of pressure equipment in order to ensure personal safety and health protection. The European Union also needs a coherent and consolidated policy to deal with industrial risk management. Monitoring the detrimental effect of Hydrogen in large and heavy chemical facilities (gas pipelines, Hydro crackers) is one important issue. Additionally, and in the short term, the EU is committed under the Kyoto Protocol, to achieving an 8% reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2008-2012 compared to the 1990 level. The transport sector accounts for close to 30% of total CO2 emissions in the EU and a major growth of up to 40% is forecast for 2010. Therefore, research is needed on alternative fuels (Hydrogen, natural gas, bio fuels) offering low or zero carbon emissions. This includes the study of fuel storage technologies providing the automotive and transport industry with reliable information on the design of on-board energy storage, upstream of the fuel cell. EPERC provides this added value by conducting relevant scientific research and development to support the implementation of EU legislations.",0,0

214,18007,Yes,Novel adsorption heat pump based on metal-supported zeolites for more efficient heating and refrigerating,"Adsorption heat pumps using zeolites and water are currently the subject of intensive research activity because they are very attractive, especially for domestic application. Nevertheless their development is still limited by poor internal heat transfer.  The aim of the project is to integrate the water adsorption capacity of zeolites with the heat conductivity of (sintered) metal substrates and to simulate an adsorption/desorption unit of a heat pump for heating and cooling. The use of a multi-reactor adsorption system in which heat is regenerated will lead to the development of a heat pump which can be operated continuously and saves energy. It is expected that the following values will be reached:  - COP value : 1.7 - 1.9 in heating  - Cycle time: 10 - 20 min  - Heat conductivity: 50 - 100 times the value of the bed of zeolite pellets  The deliverables consist of :  - A report defining the major properties and parameters of the heat pump unit and its operation.  - A report giving the performance of existing zeolites and sintered metals in heat pump operating conditions.  - A report giving the zeolite preparation, deposition and performance in adsorption capacity and heat conductivity.  - A report containing computer codes and calculation results.  The technical feasibility of adsorption machines has been demonstrated by numerous prototypes that have been built and tested. Nevertheless, the economical optimization of these systems depends on the improvement of their specific power output which requires adsorbers with high thermal conductivity and heat exchangers well adapted to the adsorbent bed. The principal disadvantage of adsorption machines is actually connected with the poor heat transfer inside the solid porous bed and at the metal-adsorbent interface.  The use of sintered metals as structuring material for deposition of adsorbent materials should produce a strong enhancement of the thermal conductivity by which heat will easily be supplied to, and removed from the zeolites.   The zeolite-water adsorbent-adsorbate pair appears the most interesting for domestic reversible heat pump application such as space heating and refrigerating by using heat as primary energy source. It presents good characteristics both from an environmental, and an energetic point of view. In fact, zeolites and water are neither polluting, nor toxic or corrosive. Water has the highest latent heat, and it is the most environmentally friendly refrigerant. If the European industry is not able to keep up with American and Japanese developments this will lead to the loss of the heat pump market. Therefore, the expertise of three European research institutes was combined to develop a novel adsorption heat pump based on metalsupported zeolites. GASTEC (Apeldoorn, NL) being project coordinator provides expertise in gas technology to the gas industry (catalysis and reactor design). The CNR-TAE institute (Messina, I) research activities concern the transformation and storage of energy by chemical processes (adsorption processes in reversible heat pump systems).  Technical University Delft (Delft, NL) has more than 15 years experience with zeolite synthesis, modification and application. Since 5 years the growth of zeolites on supports is investigated.",1,1
682,61848,No,Real Time COordination and control of Multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehiclES,"This project aims at the development of technologies and tools for real-time coordination and control of multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It will exploit the complementarities of different aerial systems (helicopters and airships) in missions where the only way to guarantee the success is the cooperation between several vehicles and where each aerial system can benefit from the data gathered by the other. This approach leads to redundant solutions offering greater fault tolerance and flexibility. The project will demonstrate the capabilities of the system in real-time forest fire detection and monitoring. Major innovations will be a multi-UAV decentralized control system, new hybrid control architecture, new UAV control techniques, real-time fault tolerance communications, cooperative environment perception, and a new relevant application.  Objectives: The main objective of COMETS is to design and implement a distributed control system for cooperative detection and monitoring using heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Particularly, both helicopters and airships will be included. In order to achieve this general objective, the project will design and implement a new control architecture, will develop new control techniques, and will integrate distributed sensing techniques and real-time image processing capabilities. In order to test and validate these concepts and systems, COMETS will demonstrate the system in forest fire detection, localisation and monitoring. This is a very challenging mission in which the cooperation of the UAVs is very valuable.  Work description: The Workprogramme consist of 7 Workpackages: Management, Specifications, Architecture (design, development, communications, and interaction and cooperation paradigms), Central real-time coordination and control (mission planning, mission monitoring and control, real-time simulator, and teleoperation tools), Distributed reliable autonomous real-time control (helicopter upgrading and integration, airship upgrading and integration, fault detection and reliability tools, UAV control methods), Cooperative Environment Perception (detection and monitoring perception tools, cooperative terrain mapping), Testing and Validation, Field Experimentation and Demonstration (preparation and coordination, field experiments, post-experiment analysis), and Dissemination and Exploitation. Special attention will be devoted to all the aspects related to reliability (architecture, communications, UAV fault detection techniques), and the exploitation of the characteristics of the multi UAV system. The project methodology is based on the use of existing UAVs. Four partners have UAVs with different characteristics, and three of them will be integrated in the system. A key aspect is the experimentation. That will include local UAV experiments and general forest fire detection and monitoring experiments. An special site will be conditioned and additional means for data acquisition and verification will be deployed.  Milestones: The milestones will be: Kick-off, Specification Review, First Project Critical Review, Architecture Review, Second Project Critical Review, Third Project Critical Review, and Final Review. The expected results will be: a new system for cooperation and control of multiple UAVs; a decentralized control system with wireless communications in stringent real-time conditions; a new control architecture, new UAV control techniques, and; new techniques for forest fire detection and monitoring.",0,0
707,219240,No,Concerted action for the European HPC CoEs,"High Performance Computing (HPC) has been recognised by the European Union as a key component of the digital single market strategy. The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is being created to support an integrated European HPC ecosystem covering all scientific and industrial value chain segments (hardware, software, applications, services, interconnections, and skills). HPC applications have a pivotal role in the HPC ecosystem: borrowing a promotional slogan used previously by the IEEE SC (supercomputing) conference – HPC Matters, primarily because the use of HPC (to address industrial, scientific and societal challenges) matters! As has been presented by the European Commission and the European Technology Platform for HPC (ETP4HPC) when establishing the contractual public private partnership (cPPP) for HPC, the European HPC Centres of Excellence (CoEs) constitute the applications-oriented pillar of the European HPC Initiative (complementing infrastructure and computing technology development). FocusCoE will contribute to the success of the EU HPC Ecosystem and the EuroHPC Initiative by supporting the EU HPC CoEs to more effectively fulfil their role within the ecosystem and initiative: ensuring that extreme scale applications result in tangible benefits for addressing scientific, industrial or societal challenges. It will do this by creating an effective platform for the CoEs to coordinate strategic directions and collaboration (addressing possible fragmentation of activities across the CoEs and coordinating interactions with the overall HPC ecosystem) and will provide support services for the CoEs in relation to both industrial outreach and promotion of their services and competences by acting as a focal point for users to discover those services.",0,0
136,102016,Yes,Development of a wind-wave power open-sea platform equipped for hydrogen generation with support for multiple users of energy,"The rational exploitation of oceans’ space and resources is increasingly seen as crucial to enhance European competitiveness in key areas such as Renewable Energy and Aquaculture. The H2OCEAN consortium aims at developing an innovative design for an economically and environmentally sustainable multi-use open-sea platform. The H2OCEAN platform will harvest wind and wave power, using part of the energy on-site for multiple applications – including a multi-trophic aquaculture farm, and convert on-site the excess energy into hydrogen that can be stored and shipped to shore as green energy carrier. The project builds on already on-going R&D and commercial activities of a partnership involving European leading industrial and academic partners from 5 countries within the fields of renewable energy, fish farming, hydrogen generation, maritime transports and related research disciplines. The unique feature of the H2OCEAN concept, besides the integration of different activities into a shared multi-use platform, lies in the novel approach for the transmission of offshore-generated renewable electrical energy through hydrogen. This concept allows effective transport and storage the energy decoupling energy production and consumption, thus avoiding the grid imbalance problem inherent to current offshore renewable energy systems. Additionally, this concept also circumvents the need for a cable transmission system which takes up a significant investment share for offshore energy generation infrastructures, increasing the price of energy. The envisaged integrated concept will permit to take advantage of several synergies between the activities within the platform significantly boosting the Environmental, Social and Economic potential impact of new maritime activities, increasing employment and strengthening European competitiveness in key economic areas.",1,1
213,109695,Yes,Adressing Energy in Parallel Technologies,"The ADEPT project will address the challenge of energy-efficient use of parallel technologies. ADEPT will build on the expertise of software developers from high-performance computing (HPC) to exploit parallelism for performance, and on the expertise of Embedded systems engineers in managing energy usage. ADEPT will develop a tool that will guide software developers and help them to model and predict the power consumption and performance of parallel software and hardware.<br/>The strength of the HPC world lies primarily in software application parallelisation: concurrent computation is used to speed-up the overall time an application requires run to completion. As a result, HPC software developers are also experts in parallel performance analysis and performance optimisation. The Embedded systems sector on the other hand excels in its management of energy usage because they are often constrained by fixed power and energy budgets. The strengths of one sector are the relative weakness of the other: power management and power efficiency in HPC are in their infancy, but they are becoming increasingly important with HPC systems requiring more and more power; and while continuing to be constrained by energy and power budgets, recent advances in low-power multi-core processors have widened the choice of hardware architectures for Embedded systems and are increasingly forcing Embedded programmers to use parallel computing techniques that are more familiar to HPC programmers.<br/>ADEPT will investigate the implications of parallelism in programming models and algorithms, as well as choice of hardware, on energy and power consumption. It is important to gain a clear understanding of how factors such as redundant computations or algorithmic choices affect the power profile of a parallel application, or how this profile can be modified in a predictable way by off-loading compute-intensive parts of an application to low-power hardware. ADEPT will progress the state-of-the-art in application profiling, performance, and energy usage modelling in order to build a tool that integrates performance and energy consumption modelling for parallel Embedded and HPC systems.<br/>ADEPT will advance the knowledge on how parallel software and hardware uses power. Being able to reduce the amount of power that is required to run large-scale applications on a HPC system will have an significant impact on the total cost of ownership and on the carbon-footprint of such a system. ADEPT will also increase programmer productivity by creating a tool that will be able to rapidly predict both the performance and the power usage of parallel systems, greatly reducing the need for speculative implementations to answer 'what if?' questions during the software development process. This will enable developers to make informed decisions with regards to hardware and software implementation that are economically viable in terms of performance and cost.",0,1
936,194439,No,Na-Ion bAttery Demonstration for Electric Storage,"Wide scale implementation of renewable energy will require growth in production of inexpensive, efficient energy storage systems. The extension of battery technology to large-scale storage will become necessary as intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and wave become more prevalent and integrated into electrical grid. Lithium-ion battery appears as quite mature for this application but its cost per mWh remains high in comparison to high temperature technology such as Zebra, which integrate low cost sodium base materials. Furthermore, as the use of large format lithium battery becomes widespread; increase demand for lithium commodity chemicals combined with geographically constrained Li mineral reserves will drive up prices. Based on the wide availability and low cost of sodium, ambient temperature sodium-based batteries have the potential for meeting large scale grid energy storage needs. In NAIADES we will demonstrate the feasibility of ambient temperature Na-ion battery from the knowledge and achievement that has been done at the laboratory scale, up to a module demonstration in a realistic application environment.   Several European industrials, institutes and universities belonging to ALISTORE-ERI have decided to join their efforts to assess the Na-ion technology for stationary storage application through building a 1 kW modules system Na-ion cell which will serve as data base to demonstrate economical and public acceptance. These module prototypes will be developed to meet performances in a 1kW system in a cost-effective, sustainable and environmental-friendly manner. New energy policy will be developed to integer the Na-ion battery in the Smart Grid initiative and promote the penetration of renewable energy in the electric network.",1,0
378,73196,No,"Gene mapping, linkage disequilibrium and heterozygosity-fitness correlations in a passerine bird","Inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity threaten the long-term survival of many small populations within the EU. These genetic effects can be examined by correlating fitness traits with heterozygosity at a set of molecular markers. Evaluations of such heterozygosity-fitness correlations (Huffs) are expected to come at increasing rates in the future, because markers are continuously being developed for new species, which thereby become accessible to study. Commonly, Huffs are interpreted as selection against inbred individuals. However, such correlations may also be found when there are high levels of linkage disequilibria. Recent studies in humans and plants indicate that linkage disequilibria are more extended than previously assumed. Consequently, the importance of linkage disequilibria in generating HFCsshould not be neglected and needs thorough evaluation. In the proposed project, my aims are to (i) construct the first linkage map in a passerine bird, (ii) quantify the linkagedisequilibrium in two populations of great reed warblers with contrasting population histories, and (iii) evaluate the importance of linkage disequilibria in generating Huffs in natural populations. In line with the objectives of the Marie Curie actions, I will get advanced scientific training within my research profile and increase my research value by undertaking a movement within the EU. By the combination of new genetic technology and ecological research, my project will contribute to enhance Ems scientific excellence in evolutionary and conservationbiology. Following the objectives of the work programme, my project aims at quantifying and preserving biodiversity, and is therefore of relevance for sustainable development and global change.

774,2749,No,Zambelli 3 - PV pumping station,"To investigate during plant operation power conditioning performance,  different power management/control techniques, battery State of Charge (SOC) control and battery degradation, PV array/module failure modes and repair techniques, to apply lessons learned from 2 lightning strike damages and to further improve plant reliability.  The Zambelli photovoltaic pumping station is producing precise and reliable basic data for the characterization and evaluation of system and plant component performance. The annually produced photovoltaic array energy increased from 58608 kWh in 1990 to 64581 kWh in 1991, while photovoltaic array energy utilization increased from 57.5% to 64.3%. A new solar sensor was installed to monitor solar irradiance. Improved on site automatic control system software to determine the performance advantage of maximum power point tracking was installed. The software also monitors the main plant components, allowing offline collection of data on efficiencies.  New hardware was installed to monitor battery state of charge and conditions; deep discharge conditions were never reached. Periodic investigations of photovoltaic array wiring identified damaged strings and repairs were carried out. Extensive damage was caused to the plant by lightning strikes and an outline of improved lightning protection has been prepared.  The direct current to direct current to direct current battery charger has performed at excellent efficiency. No decay in performance over 8 years was detected. Performance of the inverters could not be assessed, since measurements were subject to unknown error. Overall pumping efficiency averaged 72 to 73%. No degradation of photovoltaic module performance was detected; only a few modules had to be replaced. Since start-up in 1984 the ZAMBELLI photovoltaic pumping station supplies drinking water to a village reservoir in the Lessinia mountain area near Verona (Italy) against a pumping head of 350 metres. This completely automatic remote monitored stand-alone system includes two variable frequency AC inverter 35 kW pumps connected directly to the PV array and a battery powered control/monitoring system.   Under Joule programme it is intended to improve further system reliability and to take advantage of this precisely monitored plant as an experimental test bench for PV systems, components, performance prediction, design and sizing techniques. The following activities are foreseen:   - The performance advantage of Max. Power Point Tracking in comparison to constant voltage control and to direct battery connection shall be measured over 1 year.  - Inverter and DC/DC battery charger performance shall be measured and characterized precisely.  - Battery State of Charge (SOC) control shall be validated through monitoring/testing of battery.  - Detailed battery monitoring shall allow to investigate actual battery behaviour (degradation) during lifetime, and to improve diagnostic and  maintenance techniques.  - Malfunctions/failures/damages in PV modules, array cabling, diodes, wear and tear, water infiltrations shall be investigated to improve array design criteria.  - A repair/test programme shall identify suitable solutions for in-field PV module repairs, particularly concerning sealant failures caused by  solar UV radiation.  - Improvements in lighting protections : lessons learned from 2 lightning strike damages suffered by the plant during its lifetime shall be brought to actual application.",1,0
819,51900,No,"New types of drugs for cardiovascular system, based on its regulation by atp via p2","Foreseen Results  In this project a novel approach of effect-directed drug design in used to fill this gap. This approach is based on a non-exclusive model of agonist and antagonist interaction with receptor; its combination with quantitative structure-activity analysis allows prediction of the type of ligand action (agonist, antagonist or partial agonist). In this project we will express a series of the recombinant P2Y receptors in cell lines, in which the activation of these receptors is coupled to intracellular Ca2\- mobilization. The dose-response relationships of receptor activation can thus be determinated by means of fluorescence measurements to detect Ca2\mobilization. This assay system enables rapid screening of ligands and will be used for systematic studies of ligand-binding specificity of these receptor subtypes, analyzed proceeding from the modified receptor concept. Following the results of these studies new types of purinoceptor ligands will be developed, including nucleoside-coupled peptides. Screening of the activity of these ligands will be made by using synthetic combinatorial libraries, based on randomization of either the peptide or nucleotide parts of these compounds. A regulatory function of nucleotide (ATP, UMP,ADP, etc), interacting as extracellular transmitter through specific nucleotide receptors ('P2 purinoceptors') has been discovered recently and was finally established by the DNA-cloning of some of these receptors. It is becoming evident that purinergic receptors may present a novel amplification mechanism, strengthening the cellular responses in situations of crisis. This is exemplified by the platelet aggregation reaction where release of nucleotide (ADP) from one platelet activates and recruits hundred of other platelets, thus rapidly initiating blood clotting. It is obvious that such amplification is augmented in pathological conditions and the appropriate regulatory system is a potential target for drug, action, directed towards mechanisms which are primarily pathologic. Numerous in vitro and some in vivo studies have indicated that ATP is a co-transmitter in adrenergic neurones, where blocking of purinergic receptors attenuates sympathetic adrenergic responses. Thus, cardiovascular therapy directed against adrenergic receptors should be either potentiated or inhibited by P2 purinoceptor antagonists. For all of these reasons, therefore, that class of drug could be a new perspective for therapeutics for such diseases as hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and thrombosis. Developments in this area, are however, hampered by the lack of effective and subtype-specific antagonists of P2 receptors.",0,0
499,16904,No,Applications and outlets for surimis,"The goal of the proposed programme is to investigate the feasibility of the use of those kinds of surimi that can be produced in Europe, both as principal ingredient and as an additive, in a variety of different foodstuffs.  Studies have been carried out of new ways of utilizing surimi. Problems arose due to the heterogeneity of surimi fabrication batches, leading to variable quality of the raw material preventing process standardization, and also final products were rejected by a panel of tasters because of a fishy taste and smell appearing when surimis was incorporated instead of other additives. New products require to be formulated, possibly ready to eat dishes with reduced fat content and good total protein quality, which are 2 aspects consumers are looking for. The tasks of the various points of the programme are as follows:  to measure the practical and technological interest in the introduction of surimi in some basic systems of foodstuffs (seafood products, food products based on meat or pastries) and, whenever possible, a comparison with other ingredients will be carried out;  to set out basic formulae and procedures for these new applications;  and to demonstrate the functional and specific properties of kinds of surimi which are as yet little used in the foodstuffs industry, except as substitutes for crustaceans.   The results of the programme should ultimately give rise to trials in the development of new food products based on surimi for various industrial firms. The confirmation of such new outlets for surimi in the food industries should permit the development of a surimi industry in Europe.",0,0
420,73161,No,"Photophysics and Spectroscopy of Hydrides, Ions and Organic Radicals","PHOSPHOR: Photo physics and Spectroscopy of Hydrides, ions and Organic Radicals Processes that convert electronic excitation into nuclear kinetic energy largely determine the photo physics of platonic molecules in excited electronic states. Such processes are ubiquitous - in scientific areas ranging from atmospheric chemistry to photobiology, and from molecular electronics to Nan science. In the language of chemical physics, such processes represent a breakdown of the so-called Born-Oppenheimer approximation that underpins almost all of our thinking in the areas of molecular structure, spectroscopy and dynamics. Central to such thinking is the concept of the potential energy surface, on which reactants evolve to products. Recently evidence has been accumulating from both experimental and theoretical studies that the atoms and molecules can switch between electronic states during bond breakage and formation processes. Such processes are described as non-adiabatic and are driven by couplings between the ground and higher lying adiabatic Pass that are neglected within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This proposal seeks to apply cutting-edge laser based experimental techniques, particularly velocity map ion imaging methods and H (Ryder) photo fragment transactional spectroscopy, to investigate details of the primary photo physics and photo fragmentation physics of a carefully chosen range of molecules, organic free radical species, and state selected molecular ions. Each family of experiments involves innovative state-of-the- art experimentation, and will be backed up by detailed theoretical interpretation. In this way, we expect to accumulate detailed insights into the role of non-adiabatic effects in the fragmentation of different classes of molecular system (both closed-shell, and open-shell), thereby building towards a much fuller understanding of non-adiabatic couplings and their influence on molecular reactivity.",0,0
1054,95782,No,THE SOCIAL MEANING OF IMAGES: ADVERTISING POSTERS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY IN PARIS,"With this fellowship proposal I intend to explore the cultural context of the city of Paris in the first half of the 20th century, through the analysis of a specific cultural object: the advertising poster. My research will look at these posters as “social events” that create new historical identities through a communicative and symbolic efficacy. In this way I analyze these images as a real source of documentation of social practices, and as main social actors in the communicative interactions. My work will necessarily be interdisciplinary, merging together the textual meaning sciences and a narrative approach with the history of graphic arts and social-interaction-oriented methodologies. My research will also concern the relation between art and advertising during the birth of a modern city. In general I can state that, from their beginnings in the 19th century with Manet’s posters, the relation between the poster and Paris is a primal binomial that engendered the future evolution of advertisting arts, with influences still visible today. This is true not only in Paris but also in many other European cities. This is the reason why, by studying the cultural identity of Paris, we will also be studying an important aspect of a more general European identity.",0,0

1020,104937,No,Integrating Graphene Devices,"Technology requirements for future IC systems include low power computing and communication, sensing capabilities and energy harvesting. These will unlikely be met with silicon technology alone. The proposed research therefore investigates graphene as a potential alternative technology and contributes to bridging the “valley of death” in innovation that is all too present in Europe. In detail, the proposal focuses on the experimental exploration of novel (opto-) electronic devices and systems based on graphene. Strong emphasis is put on integration, defined as an interdisciplinary approach combining graphene manufacturing, graphene process technology, device engineering and -physics as well as system design. This kind of approach is urgently needed in order to open new horizons for graphene, because it enables a transition from fascinating science to a realistic demonstration of graphene’s application potential in electronics and optoelectronics. The first requirement for the applicability of graphene in ICT is a scalable graphene fabrication technology that can be co-integrated with silicon. The second logical aspect to be investigated is the intricate relationship between process technology and graphene device performance. The third aspect to be considered when discussing integration is how devices can be integrated in existing or future systems, including questions of circuit design. Will graphene systems outperform existing solutions and thus replace them? Will new functionalities emerge and generate novel applications? Hence, the key objectives of this proposal are: 1) a scalable, CMOS compatible large area fabrication technology for graphene and graphene devices, 2) demonstration and assessment of performance advantages and new functionalities of RF graphene devices, 3) high performance graphene-based optoelectronic devices integrated with silicon technology and 4) experimental exploration of the performance potential of graphene-based integrated systems.",0,0
65,32547,Yes,Integrating technology diffusion micro models for assessing sustainable development policy options,"To analyze the macro-economic consequences of the process of technology adoption and diffusion of three 'environmentally friendly' new technologies.  OBJECTIVES:  To analyze the macro-economic consequences of the process of technology adoption and diffusion of three 'environmentally  friendly' new technologies.  DESCRIPTION:  The research bridges the gap between aggregated  representations of technology used in Computable General  Equilibrium (CGE) type macro-economic forecasting models, and more detailed micro-models at the level of specific  technologies. Improved technology adoption/diffusion models  for potentially important new environmentally relevant  technologies are developed and integrated into a macroeconomic framework. The employment and resource consumption  implications, at the European level, of the three innovative technologies that are widely considered to be 'environmentally friendly' are then analysed. These technologies are:   i) the use of non-polluting electric vehicles in urban areas(combined with computerized traffic controls, integration   with other modes of transport such as high-speed trains,   and congestion taxes);   ii) the integration of photo-voltaic (PV) and solar heatingtechnologies in buildings;   iii) the use of biofuels in automotive transportation.  A projection of (technological) performance and costs for each of these technologies is prepared, leading to the formulation of an adoption/diffusion model which describes the process of diffusion through an 'experience curve'. The innovation submodels are integrated in a CGE framework in an iterative  fashion.  Several alternative 'policy mixes', including fiscal reforms are tested and their political acceptability assessed with  respect to those 'external' considerations which are not  directly incorporated in the models. These include equity  issues as well as local and global environmental concerns.",0,1
473,4797,No,Solar grade silicon solar cells,"In view of the predicted shortage of feedstock silicon for solar cell production in a few years, this project is intended to explore the usability of unconventional silicon sources. This material is called solar grade silicon and is distinct from the electronic grade silicon used in the semiconductor industry. It should be capable of production in large quantities. The objectives are:  -to review current and future industrial sources of solar grade silicon e.g. Elkem, Bayer, TEMAV, Wacker,Siemens...  -to evaluate the available materials. The quality of solar cells is closely related to the chemical purity of the silicon, but it is well known, that different impurities have different behaviours. There is a general agreement that, to be successful on the market, silicon solar cells should have efficiencies well above 10%. Therefore, a fairly high quality for the solar grade material is essential.    A number of goals should be reached in the course of the project : - description of the available techniques to produce 'solar grade' silicon, and naming the companies involved.  - specification of the requirements for a material that is good for solar cells with efficiency well above 10%, and comparison of available materials with these requirements.  - Definition of crystallization techniques, that might be able to improve materials by the isolation, and definition of passivation techniques, to improve the material during solar cell processing. These definitions will follow from the best results experimentally obtained during this project on solar grade silicon solar cells. Feedback will be given to the different stages of manufacturing: solar grade material, crystallisation and solar cell fabrication.   Four tasks have to be pursued successively and in parallel to reach the goals. They are strongly interdependent, but formally they can be treated separately:  - prospection and procurement of solar grade silicon on the market - experimental crystal growth  - evaluation of the materials  - material",1,0
520,214241,No,The industrialization and market entry of a novel bioengineered hydrogel grid to standardize stem cell cultures for precision medicine.,"The ability to generate miniature organ models in a dish, termed organoids, from patient stem cells has opened endless possibilities for applications in precision medicine. SUN bioscience SA, a spin-off company of EPFL in Switzerland, was founded in 2016 with the ambition to move these organoid cultures from basic research to the Health Care industry.   To reach this goal, SUN bioscience has developed Gri3D, a microstructured biocompatible hydrogel platform, and aims to establish this technology as a new standard for growing organoids at industrial scale and precision. Gri3D prototypes have been field tested with over 30 European academic and pharmaceutical R&D groups. In addition, SUN bioscience has developed an industrial automated manufacturing mechanism for Gri3D that is now being translated into the world-wide first machine, Hydra I, that auomates liquid handling with hydrogel microembossing.  The objective of this feasibility study is to verify the technical, economical and practical viability of Gri3D and to ensure its successful market entry in Europe. Specifically, the first step is to validate the production capacity of Hydra I by producing 1’000 Gri3D units, which corresponds to one tenth of the total annual target production volume. In a second step, SUN bioscience aims to validate the market by commercializing these 1’000 Gri3D units to existing customers and to expand its customer base to a total of 20-40 recurrent clients.  According to our current strategy, SUN bioscience will run at maximum single line production capacity with cumulative revenues of >€2M within 3 years after market introduction of Gri3D. The 3D technologies market is expected to reach €600M by 2021. The long-term business objective is to implement organoid assays on Gri3D and to establish SUN bioscience as a leader in clinical diagnostics with the intention to initiate a phase 2 SME instrument project along this path.",0,0
88,37180,Yes,Valve-regulated battery with improved separators avoiding electrolyte stratification and charge controller for low-cost photovoltaic and wind installations,"PROJECT OBJECTIVES   The objective of this project is the development of improved and low cost PV/wind systems, to be used mainly in special locations like isolated areas, farmhouses, etc, in which it is more advantageous to install such systems than to be connected to the main network what would be too costly in most cases.  These systems are composed of three main subsystems : Solar or wind turbine generators, batteries for storing generated energy, and charge controller/conditioner. Among these systems, the most important for determing the performance and life are the batteries and the charge regulator. The specific objective of the project is to improve the performance of both components, with special incidence in the battery.   TECHNICAL APPROACH   The specific problem, that at the battery level limits the performance and especially the system life, is the progressive development of acid stratification (different acid densities from the bottom to the top) in the battery. This is mainly due to the fact that in solar/wind applications, due to their random nature, a complete recharge of the batteries cannot be always assured. The development of electrolyte stratification will lead to the following problems : Lower energy available from the battery, high sulphation of the plates, and, especially, high corrosion. The result is a severe limitation of the attainable life.   In this project, the intention is to overcome this problem developing a new separator material, that will decrease, or even eliminate, the acid stratification in the battery. To achieve this, the structure of the glass mat separator will be modified by the inclusion of especial filling materials. Concerning charge regulator the main feature will be the degree of overcharge, depth of discharge) along the previous two weeks, for optmizing the using conditions and life.   EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION   After completion of the project, the life of these systems is expected to be improved from the actual value (around 400 cycles), to more than 800 deep discharge cycles. This marked increase will lead to a significant decrease of the cost of these systems, on a life basis, making them more competitive and attractive to the user. If successful, the new battery with the new separator could be also applied to other uses that imply heavy and repetitive cycling, like light motive power applications. The financial involvement of several industrial partners a big company like TUDOR and small and specialized ones like BERNARD DUMAS and ATERSA, is an indication of their interest in the exploitation of the results.",1,1
235,106330,Yes,Qualification and Diagnosis of Carbon and Glass Fibre-Reinforced Composites with Non-Destructive Measurement Technologies,"Today, fibre-reinforced composites (CRP/GRP)  can be found in high tech applications like in aerospace and energy industry. The production of these materials is expensive and the quality control is often manually conducted. As the processes of quality control and even the way how to analyse and characterize damage and defects within fibre-reinforced composites are not standardized yet, parts consisting of these materials are replaced instead of being repaired, often without being sure, whether the function of the part is negatively affected or not. It can be easily imagined, that high costs occur by this approach.  In the future fibre-reinforced composites will be increasingly used in every industrial sector, in which material characteristics like light weight in combination with high resistance is required. Especially automotive industry is now focussing on these new materials, looking for innovative application areas e.g. trim parts without additional finishing. For this purpose manufacturing processes and material costs have to be developed in a comparable range of today’s costs.  The proposed project will examine the possible ways for an adequate quality assurance for CFP- or GRP-components. To receive calculable quality, measurement methods and data processing procedures are necessary. Considering different aspects of CRP/GRP-products it is obvious, that only non-destructive technologies like 3D-computer tomography, thermography and ultrasonic scanning in correlation with intelligent software solutions will lead to significant and evaluable results.  The overall aim is to achieve a comparable and measurable quality standard for CRP/GRP products. This will prepare applied CRP/GRP products to enter large-scale markets and new industries. The project results and the gathered knowledge will allow  the SMEP to expand their portfolio. This will improve the SMEPs competitive position in the global market.",0,1
548,20366,No,Human bone marrow stem cell,"In January 1990, at the beginning of the Human Bone Marrow Stem Cell Concerted Action (CA), no laboratory in Europe was planning to develop large scale purification methods for isolating the hematopoietic stem cell for either cell or gene therapy.   In 1993, staff in various European laboratories have become acquainted, and have interacted with each other. This has allowed us to organize stem cells, to meet regularly and to compare various clinical devices to purify stem cells, and to organize gene therapy or clinical groups at a European level. Various European laboratories have interacted to organize stem cell banks and to compare various clinical devices to purify stem cells for use in gene therapy. Media have been developed in for use in multicentre clinical trials in order to standardize stem cell assays which are a prerequisite for stem cell purification.  The mixed colony assay is an assay where one cell is able to provide a colony in which the megakaryocytes, the granulocytes, the monocytes and erythrocytes are able to develop simultaneously in a clone. Some groups are developing a modification of this assay for the production of T or B lymphoid lineage cells together with the myeloid lineages. Standardized media for mixed colony assays have been provided with all the recombinant cytokines available to date. One laboratory has developed this assay in serum free conditions. With this medium very large colonies may be obtained from a single cell. Liquid cultures have also been developed in order to expand earlyprogenitors for the mass production of cells for transfusion or for favoring rapid engraftment after transplantation. An animal model for a human stem cell assay is also being developed using immunodeficient mice engrafted with hemopoietic tissues and treated with human cytokines.  Various laboratories have used bone marrow cells to purify CD34\ stem cells but large amounts of bone marrow are not always available. Umbilical cord blood was found to be another source of cells. The stem cells obtained here have a larger haematopoietic potential than those obtained in adult bone marrow or adult peripheral blood, and although the volume of blood in the umbilical cord is smaller than the volume of marrow which is used for adult bone marrow transplantation, there are sufficient umbilical cord blood cells for adult transplantation. This has been demonstrated in vitro and is being used in hospitals for transplantation.  Various groups are developing new vectors and new methods for the stable introd uction of genes of interest into the genome in various haematological diseases. The possibility of gene therapy using stem cells would require only one transplant and one difficulty that has been overcome is the problem of inserting genes into cells which are not dividing. Stem cells are in the Go phase or in a quiescent state and by releasing the Go block the stable transfer of marker genes has been significantly improved. In 1990, when the CA started, human bone marrow stem cells were not being purified for clinical use. These cells are very rare, representing less than one in 10000 mononuclear cells in the human bone marrow. These cells are very difficult to purify because they are not easy to assay. No simple assay is available for detecting single stem cells. The best assay has been developed in the murine system. In this system, 20 purified stem cells, when injected into an irradiated mouse, were able to reconstitute hematopoiesis completely. Such experiments are impossible in man. This is why the CA has developed a quick in vitro assay to identify the 'stem cell compartment'. With their improved identification (the CD34\, CD38-, DR-, Thy-1\ cells), we have compared and improved the various purification methods which are available for laboratory work. We have chosen among these methods, those which could be used easily for clinical studies. We have compared not only the efficacy of various devices but also their cost and the fact that they are easy to use. During the CA, umbilical cord blood cells have been identified as a new and rich source of stem cells. As bone marrow donors are too few for the needs of transplantation, it was important to develop this new approach. Umbilical cord blood provides an unlimited source of cells which covers all HLA types. Moreover umbilical cord blood is easier to collect than bone marrow, and is unlimited.   Stem cell transplantation has a very wide range of uses for future studies. It will allow cancer treatments to be carried out with higher doses of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, with the new stem cells being grafted after the treatment. It will also be used for the introduction of new genes for gene therapy. The stem cell is indeed an excellent candidate for gene therapy as this cell generates the cells of the hematopoietic and immune system.",0,0
801,110970,No,Nanoelectronic COupled Problems Solutions,"Designs in nanoelectronics often lead to problems that are large to simulate and that include strong feedback couplings. Industry demands to include variability to guarantee quality and yield. It also requests to incorporate higher abstraction levels to allow for system simulation in order to shorten design cycles, while preserving accuracy. The nanoCOPS project considers the simulation of two problem classes identified by industry:- Power-MOS devices, with applications in energy harvesting, and which involve couplings between electromagnetics (EM), heat, and stress, and- RF-circuitry in wireless communication, which involves EM-circuits-heat coupling and multirate behaviour, together with analogue-digital signals.Due to the market demands, the scientific challenges are to- create efficient and robust simulation techniques for strongly coupled systems, that exploit the different dynamics of sub-systems and that can deal with signals that differ strongly in the frequency range;- include variability such that robust design, worst case analysis, and yield estimation with tiny failures are possible (including large deviations like 6-sigma);- reduce complexity such that one can still vary parameters and such that the reduced models offer higher abstraction models that are efficient to simulate.Our solutions are- advanced co-simulation/multirate/monolithic techniques, combined with envelope/wavelet approaches;- new generalized techniques from Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for coupled problems, tuned to the statistical demands from manufacturability;- enhanced, parameterized Model Order Reduction techniques for coupled problems and for UQ.All algorithms will be validated in the industrial design tools provided by our industrial partners.Our consortium covers extensive R&D experience in nanoelectronic IC simulation and complementary expertise.

1011,91063,No,Search for mechanisms to control massless electrons in graphene,"Conduction electrons in the carbon monolayer known as graphene have zero effective mass. This property offers unique opportunities for fast electronics, if we can somehow learn to control the dynamics of particles which have a charge but no mass. Fresh ideas are needed for this purpose, since an electric field is incapable of stopping a massless electron (its velocity being energy independent).  The applicant and his group at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics in Leiden University have started exploring the new physics of graphene soon after the announcement two years ago of the discovery of massless electrons in this material. We have identified several promising control mechanisms, and are now ready to embark on a systematic search. Our objective is to discover ways to manipulate in a controlled manner three independent electronic degrees of freedom: charge, spin, and valley.  The charge is the primary carrier of classical information, being strongly coupled to the environment, while the spin is the primary carrier of quantum information, in view of its weak coupling to the environment. The valley degree of freedom (which defines the chirality of the massless particles) is intermediate between charge and spin with regard to the coupling to the environment, and provides some unique opportunities for control. In particular, we have the idea that by acting on the valley rather than on the charge it would be possible to fully block the electronic current (something which an electric field by itself is incapable of). To study these effects we will need to develop new methodologies, since the established methods to model quantum transport in nanostructures are unsuitable for massless carriers.",0,0
1037,87851,No,Providing an Infrastructure for Research on Electoral Democracy in the European Union,"This three-year design study will assess the feasibility of providing an infrastructure for research into citizenship, political participation, and electoral democracy in the European Union (EU). Such an infrastructure would endow the social science community with the most essential information required for a recurrent audit of the most important aspects of the electoral process in the European Union. Since elections are crucial instruments of popular control, elite accountability, and popular representation, auditing these processes is seen as good practice in a number of democracies. Such audits empirically assess the nature of electoral processes and detect challenges and threats to the quality of these processes. The infrastructure project that we propose to design focuses on data which, if not collected at the time of an election, will either be lost or will be recorded in a manner incompatible with the way in which other relevant data have been recorded, making the complete picture unavailable for future research. At the EU’s supra-national level, democratic rules and procedures are not yet well established and the institutions of multi-level governance are repeatedly renegotiated and adapted. Auditing the quality of the electoral process at the EU-level is therefore essential. Such an audit would involve the activities of parties (and candidates), mass media and voters. Scholarly evaluations of electoral processes at the EU level have been hampered until now by the lack of co-ordination in the collection of empirical information on which such evaluations are based. The current proposal seeks to change this, and to provide an infrastructure that organizes the necessary coordination and collects a comprehensive empirical database for use by the social science community interested in electoral democracy in Europe. We will investigate the infrastructure’s feasibility by means of a pilot study conducted in the context of the 2009 European Parliament elections.",0,0

370,90566,No,Characterizing the effects of the Mediterannean diet on endothelial dysfunction,"It is well established that death rates from cardiovascular disease are substantially lower in Mediterranean countries, which has been attributed the consumption of an unique collection of foods referred to as the Mediterranean diet. Although the mechanisms underlying the effects of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease remain largely unclear, a important role for polyphenols and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are abundantly present in olive oil, is suspected. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark for the initial stage of vascular dysfunction and has been associated with cardiovascular disease. Consumption of high fat meals result in an impaired postprandial endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation, markers of inflammation and markers of oxidative stress. However, the mechanism that mediate the effects of high fat meals on endothelial function remains unclear. The aim of the present project is to uncover the mechanisms that underlie the preventive effects of the Mediterranean diet on development of cardiovascular diseases, with a focus on endothelial dysfunction and the specific impact of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols. To that end, we will perform whole genome expression profiling on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells collected from 20 healthy young Caucasian men that received a milkshake containing 55 grams of SFA enriched or MUFA enriched fat as part of a single-blind cross-over dietary intervention trial. In addition, we will expose freshly isolated HUVEC and PBMC with specific dietary fatty acids and polyphenols for analysis of gene expression and protein secretion of specific markers of endothelial activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Characterizing the activity and mechanism of action of these dietary components may lead to the identification of valuable new targets in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",0,0

Disease control has been compromised by the withdrawal of key pesticides and disinfectants by the EU in recent years, such as the withdrawal of approval for formaldehyde as a disinfectant and carbendazim fungicide for Trichoderma control.  The Mushroom SME AGs want to know what their members must do to prevent and / or control outbreaks of Trichoderma and Virus.  Disease control must now be based on a sustainable integrated pest management system (IPM).  IPM focuses on combining (i) improved hygiene procedures (ii) knowledge of how individual diseases and pests spread within and between crops (epidemiology), (iii) improved diagnostics and (iv) optimum use of available products to control and reduce the incidence of disease.  This project aims to provide research-based solutions for the mushroom industry to deal with these two relatively new major diseases affecting production. Application of the solutions developed by this project to the European mushroom industry will reduce crop losses and increase efficiency and competitiveness.  During the project we will (1) generate technical research-based information on how Trichoderma and MVX grow, survive and spread in mushroom compost in order to identify the weak links in the chain and the steps needed to strengthen them; (2) screen and evaluate alternative disinfectant and biocontrol products for use in disease prevention and control programmes; (3) identify, characterise and quantify the presence of pathogens on mushroom farms and compost facilities across Europe over a period of up to 12 months, using the most up to date technologies; (4) work towards identifying diagnostics service provider(s) who will offer new diagnostic tests, developed during the project, to SME AG members; (5) compile key results into Technical Factsheets for SME AGs to distribute to their members and (6) hold seminars, workshops and conferences organised by SME AGs for their members.  In the region of 300\ SME mushroom growers and composters  will benefit from the results and this will lead to reduced disease incidence and associated costs savings among a large group of SMEs.",0,0
351,204238,No,an innovative system for building hulls for recreational and work boats,"'The project S.D.S. Strength Distribution System, consists of the creation of an innovative system for building hulls for recreational and work boats. Currently boat hulls are made of considerable, almost uniform thickness throughout, while the forces acting on them are very different in their intensity, direction and the areas on which they are exerted. To simplify construction, the point that undergoes the greatest force is studied and everything is built based on those data. This leads to a considerable increase in weight where this is not necessary. The Strength Distribution System, on the other hand, is characterised by the construction of a thin exoskeleton in red cedar that follows the force lines acting on the hull, thus creating a kind of framework on which planking much thinner than traditional planking is applied. Everything is enclosed within two “skins” of vacuum impregnated carbon or fibreglass. The carbon skins so applied and thus distant from each other act with the strength of a beam, much greater than that of one plane. For the same strength and rigidity, the tests done take us to weights 23-28% lower than a traditional hull. The saving in weight is fundamental because it increases the autonomy of the boat and its safety, reducing consumption and as a result its environmental impact. Because of vacuum impregnation, production costs are slightly higher than for a traditional hull. The boat market tries to reduce weights as much as possible, spending considerable amounts; the Strength Distribution System will be revolutionary because it does not act on materials but on the form. It faithfully reflects the innovative spirit of 'Horizon 2020 Work Programme Smart, Green and Integrated Transport” at point 4 “Waterborne'. The objective in phase 1 is to create a precise and detailed business plan which defines the technical, economic and commercial feasibility of the solution proposed in order to begin phase 2 starting from solid conceptual bases.'",0,0

Awareness in higher and middle management in industry that software development and its management forms a technological and managerial discipline in its own right and of increasing strategic importance has been raised. A study has been undertaken, the results of which form a sound basis for subsequent programmes on technology transfer. Informative material, including public relations communications, has been distributed, and presented at conferences and workshops. BOOTSTRAP aims to address a relevant large community in European industry through:   - the wider distribution of informative material, including public relations communications  - a phased approach over two years, starting with building a sound technical and managerial foundation, moving on to performing limited-scale experiments, and finally communicating the results to the wider community of users in Europe.",0,0
925,75697,No,"Rare genetic skin disease: advancing diagnosis, management and awareness through a European network","Genetic skin diseases comprise almost 300 rare but often severe and even life-threatening diseases and syndromes. Despite recent identification of causative genes in a number of these disorders, the molecular bases of several others are still unknown, and often the function of the identified disease-gene products remains an unsolved mystery. In addition, disease number and rarity impair proper management, and no curative therapy is available. By bringing together clinicians, researchers and patient associations, GENESKIN aims to generate accessible knowledge and improve health care service structures for affected people. The focus is on five major disease categories: epithelial adhesion disorders, keratinization disorders, ectodermal dysplasias, connective tissue diseases, DNA repair disorders. For each group, a clinical and laboratory network will generate and disseminate: 1) a list of reference centers with services offered, 2) diagnostic questionnaires/protocols 3) gene cards, mutation database, diagnostic reagent lists, and ongoing clinical trial list. The research topics to be co-ordinated in GENESKIN deal with: i) improved early post-natal and pre-natal diagnosis by novel immunohistochemical/biochemical and molecular tests, ii) identification of new genes involved in genetic skin diseases by collecting a sizable number of biological samples iii) definition of genotype-phenotype correlation and characterisation of newly identified gene product functions by creation of a sample Databank. Knowledge dissemination and improved management will also be insured through the organisation of involved personnel training. Finally, pan-European communication among patients' organisations, ethic committees, physicians and scientist will be promoted. The information regarding clinical/diagnostic protocols/lists, diagnostic and research tools and communication among different groups will be integrated and disseminated through a dedicated web site.",0,0

22,222558,Yes,Indian and European Local Energy CommuniTies for Renewable Integration and the Energy Transition.,"An increasing role is foreseen in Europe for local energy communities (LECs) to speed up the grid integration of RES. To-day, the enabling role of DSOs in support of LECs is hampered by a lack of flexibility when planning cost-efficient LEC connections to their network at MV level, and by a lack of digitalization of the LV networks to make LEC’s smart prosumers benefit economically when serving the DSO flexibility needs. Four European DSOs (E.ON, ENEDIS, E.DIS, Güssing Stadtwerke) and an Indian DSO (TATA) have joined with IT-based, innovative product and solution providers, and technology and research centers, to demonstrate the combined roles of innovative functionalities serving the MV and LV networks, when implemented in 5 different regulatory regimes (Austria, France, Hungary, Germany, India- state of Delhi-). For MV networks, a mobile storage concept at substation level is demonstrated in Hungary, Germany and Austria. It enables DSOs to reduce investment uncertainties, avoid hindering future renewables connection and foster the local use of flexibility with participating non-regulated market solutions (Demand Side Response-DR-).   For LV networks, 3 functional use cases served by ATOS and Schneider are tested simultaneously in Austria and India with prosumer support: i) Forecasting/scheduling of Distributed Energy Resources for the optimized energy management of Local Energy Systems, ii) Customized, human-centric prosumer participation in explicit DR programs using context-aware flexibility profiles, iii) Grid-forming/islanding capabilities in Local Energy Communities to optimize their energy system resilience.   The joint work of DSOS aims at accelerating scaling up and replication tested by HEDNO (Greece) and E.ON (Sweden). Dissemination towards players of the energy value chain recommends business models, possible regulatory adjustments and deployment roadmaps of the most promising use cases, in support of the implementation of the Clean Energy Package.",1,1

It will address all the modes of transport - road, rail, air and water - as well as intermodal operations and transport services. The modes will be addressed not separately, but in cross-modal studies by topic, so that the human and organisational issues can be studied generically. The timing and rate of introduction of new technologies often varies considerably between the modes; the cross-modal approach will provide a structure for studying how relevant is the experience of one mode for other modes.  %",0,0
691,80050,No,Management of AGing of I and C equipments in Nuclear Power Plants,"Instrument and control (I&C) systems represent a critical part of Nuclear plant equipment. Several functions of I&C systems are directly safety related, such as the reactor protection system. The ageing of I&C equipment presents a risk for plant safety and availability. A number of utilities have experienced plant shutdowns after electronic failures due to ageing.  A plant shutdown is a transient initiator. Moreover, if ageing phenomena are not anticipated, the renovations costs may be prohibitive because of the increased downtimes and the lack of preparation of these renovations. There is therefore a common need: anticipate the generic ageing mechanisms as early as possible.  MAGIC coordination action gathers nuclear utilities and scientists and its objectives are to: - ensure a desirable reliability level of I&C systems during the remaining life time of the I&C systems, so that the objective of safety of the plant can be achieved, - ensure an homogeneous knowledge all over European nuclear utilities about the prevailing ageing mechanisms of I&C equipments, and the advanced tools (already used or under development) that are able to efficiently follow-up these mechanisms and to anticipate and plan refurbishments. - ensure, until the end of life of each Nuclear Plant, the O&M staff knowledge, necessary to manage I&C ageing.  Here is a brief description of MAGIC actions: - Create a European network of partners. - Share utilities and scientific knowledge about: I&C ageing mechanisms, follow-up indicators, and corresponding tools to measure these indicators. A permanent common database will be developed and maintained. - Share advanced tools to measure ageing indicators for each type of I&C equipment. The feasibility studies will be performed within the MAGIC CA but the subsequent development and tests will be funded with private funds. - Create a training document for I&C operation and maintenance staff.",0,0

570,225993,No,Innovative Future-Proof Testing Methods for Reliable Critical Components in Wind Turbines,"The future wind turbines will require flexible and economically affordable PDPs to obtain reliable and validated new concepts for bigger wind turbines or already installed turbines.   One of the most critical components that have a high contribution to wind farms OpEx costs are the bearings  (selected Case Studies 1 and 3 during INNTERESTING) and gearboxes (selected Case Study 2 during INNTERESTING). Since both components transfer high loads and have high failure rates, they are considered as critical components inside the wind turbine. Although the percentage of the total Capex cost of bearings (2% ) is not as high as other structures (e.g. blades 22% and gearbox 13%) , their role is not insignificant.However, the role of bearings and gears in the OpEx is higher due to the major impact of early. The fatigue requirements that must be assured for the lifetime is a key factor to reduce the negative effect of reparations. New wind energy key concepts and uses which are faster to commercialisation have been prioritised:  INNTERESTING project aims to accelerate wind energy technology development and increase lifetime extension of wind turbine components by developing a disruptive methodology to demonstrate reliability of larger wind turbine critical components without the need of building larger test-benches in the future by overcoming size dependent issues during design process and testing. In this matter, INNTERESTING project pursues the development of innovative virtual and hybrid testing methods for prototype validation of pitch bearing and gearboxes components (Selected Study Cases Components).

MAIA uses the System of Environmental Economic Accounting – Experimental Ecosystem Accounting  (SEEA-EEA) as the methodological basis for NCA. The SEEA EEA provides a consistent framework for analysing and storing information on ecosystem assets and flows of ecosystem services, in both physical and monetary units. The SEEA EEA follows a spatial approach, requiring extensive (spatial) data and models as inputs into the accounts.  In MAIA, a flexible approach will be followed, allowing for adaptation of the SEEA EEA framework to the conditions of individual EU countries. In particular, MAIA will: (i) assess policy priorities for accounting; (ii) test, pilot and mainstream NCA in 10 countries; (iii) test innovative approaches for NCA in the European context; and (iv) support NCA in the EU through various communication and dissemination activities including the development of guidelines, a web-based information system and other facilitating actions. MAIA will involve in-country work in Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain but there will be outreach to all EU member states through exchanging data, guidelines and experiences.

These compounds will derive from plants originating from major biodiversity hotspots in Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The starting point of the project will be a diversity-oriented natural product library of 500 compounds from the existing compound repositories of three project partners. Screening of this compound library in assay panels for agrochemical (antifungal, herbicidal, insecticidal) and cosmetic properties (UV-protection, anti-aging, anti-hyperpigmentation) will rapidly identify promising scaffolds. This knowledge will serve as entry points for a chemotaxonomy and chemodiversity oriented collection of plants which are thought to contain structural variants and decorations of these scaffolds. A liquid library of 3600 extracts will be generated and screened. Stringent prioritization and profiling procedures will generate 100 compounds as focused sub-libraries around the privileged scaffolds. A state-of-the-art technology platform for miniaturized natural product discovery will be used for the purpose. Evaluation of these sub-libraries will lead to 30 compounds which will undergo advanced testing to qualify 5 compounds as development candidates for novel agrochemical and/or cosmetic agents with new or improved properties over existing active ingredients. An additional outcome of the project will be an extract library with a unprecedented level of associated spectroscopic information and metadata, to be used for future purposes.

Currently only 1% of RE waste is being recovered as no adequate process is available, so proof-of-concept in REE4EU will open-up a fully new route bringing recovery of 90% of in-process wastes from PM manufacturing within reach. The targeted integrated solution is based on recently developed lab-proven technologies for direct high-temperature electrolyses of REA production. It will be combined in the pilots with an innovative and proven Ionic Liquid Extraction or tailored hydrometallurgical pre-treatment to demonstrate dramatic improvements in cost and environmental performance compared to state of the art technologies. This includes avoidance of process steps (pure RE extraction and reprocessing), 50% energy savings, and 100% recycling of ionic liquids as opposed to disposal of strong acid leeching agents in state of the art pre-treatment steps.  The project involves in its consortium the full value chain including (SME and large) RE metal producers, PM manufacturer, SME process engineering companies and LCA experts, (SME and large) electronics and battery recycling companies, SME technology transfer, innovation specialists as well as chemical and end-user associations. Together with 4 top research institutes on electrolyses, ionic liquids and RE recycling,  they will prove technical and economic viability on in-process PM waste (swarf), as well as End-of-Life (EoL) PM and SB waste, develop urgently required market data on EoL RE availability and a triple value-chain business case for a new European secondary Rare Earth Alloys (REA) production sector, creating new jobs, increasing Europe’s independence from imports and providing valuable raw materials for fast growing European green-technology industries such as Electrical/Hybrid vehicles and Wind Turbines.",0,0
809,107382,No,High Performance Energy Harvesters,"Micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) impact everyone every day. Mobile phones, laptops, hearing aids, watches, automotive and medical devices are only few examples of portable goods that include MEMS. Such products mostly rely on batteries as their source of power, and the need for battery replacement/recharging, and environmental concerns, are increasingly an issue. Harvesting energy from every day motion, otherwise left unused, is a recent approach to supply energy for portable goods, ranking as one of the current top 10 technologies according to EE Times. Nevertheless, the energy efficiency of energy harvesters has not been sufficient thus far, particularly if the harvesters are not operating in their natural frequency. In addition, energy harvesting is a cross-disciplinary field with both structural and electrical challenges creating additional difficulties in solving the energy efficiency problem. This research proposal aims at tackling both mechanical and electrical challenges at the same time. The stiffness of the MEMS energy harvester will be removed, or tuned to a pre-defined nonlinear behaviour using static balancing theory. This is an entirely new approach the present applicant has been working with for the last four years at Delft University of Technology. The electronic tuning will be achieved via the transducer, a method for which the  host group at Imperial College London is famous. The present proposal shall develop an efficient energy harvester to harvest from low and wide range frequency of human body motion. Being a straightforward method, this approach is not only essential for MEMS medical devices, but will also serve as a framework to guide other industrial applications.",0,0
963,108778,No,COst & PERformaNces Improvement for Cgh2 composite tanks,"A certain level of maturity of on-board compressed gaseous storage systems have been demonstrated through large Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) deployment projects like Clean Energy Partnership (100\ FCEVs). In addition, major car companies have confirmed their intent to start production by 2015. Nevertheless, major issues still remain to be addressed: - VOLUME: Actual CGH2 tank production is far from being capable of feeding the volume requested by the automotive industry. Therefore, current manufacturing equipment and production strategies are not designed for addressing such a market. - COSTS: Latest techno-economic analysis (DoE 05/2011) are still forecasting that industrial costs for 700bar CGH2 tanks may remain 4 to 5 times higher than expected targets. This is particularly critical with respect to a massive deployment of FCEV. COPERNIC will address the two major targets: performance improvements and cost reduction of 70MPa TypeIV composite vessels for automotive application in order to achieve targets and lead to rapid industrial exploitation owing to the strong contribution of 4 SME and industrial partners in the consortium. It will provide real scale demonstration on a pilot manufacturing line quantitative and technical and economic assessment of strategies including evolution of materials, components, processes and designs. Therefore, in full consistency with the call Topic, the COPERNIC project will contribute to: - Increase the maturity and competitiveness of CGH2 manufacturing processes evolving from classical automotive manufacturing technologies or concepts. - Decrease costs while improving composite quality, manufacturing productivity and using optimized composite design, materials and components. The scope of work has been defined taking into account past project outcomes (STORHY) and on-going project objectives (HYCOMP).

776,83070,No,Dynamical and structural properties of linear water Clusters: Long range Proton Transport in an ordered Water Phase,"The aim of this project is to provide an in depth analysis of linear water clusters, and their long range proton transport capabilities, from a quantum dynamics perspective, and to give a detailed description of their operation, in view of the envisaged technological relevance these systems may acquire in the near future. The project will first focus on the dynamical aspects of the Zundel cation, composed of two water molecules and an excess proton, the smallest system where the proton relay mechanism can operate.  The research will be based on the extremely acurate Potential Energy Surface made available last year, which will allow for very detailed quantum dynamical investigations. Our goal will be to establish the factors governing the efficiency of the proton relay mechanism, drain of energy to non productive modes, energy loss to the supramolecular environment due to confinement. We will also focus on the photodynamics of the system, which breaks apart upon photoexcitation. The behaviour of the system under such conditions is not only important to proton wires themselves, but also to bulk phase and gas phase properties of water under irradiation. Last but not least, an important part of the project will be the development and coding of new algorithms that will allow for the quantum simulation of even larger systems.  The development work will be done on the basis of the MCTDH program, under continuous development at the University of Heidelberg for more than 15 years. This will allow many more studies to be performed in the future, which adds an increased value to the project itself. The realization of this research proposal will allow an experienced researcher to complement his background and consolidate a position of professional maturity at an European level.

781,110525,No,FET Flagship ERA-NET,"The FET Flagship ERA-NET, called FLAG-ERA, gathers national and regional funding organisation with the goal of supporting the FET Flagship initiatives and more generally the FET Flagship concept. Most funding organisations in Europe participate, either directly or as associated members. The project also fosters international cooperation with funding organisations outside Europe. FLAG-ERA thus offers a platform to coordinate a wide range of sources of funding towards the realization of very ambitious research goals.FLAG-ERA contributes to the construction of the two Flagship initiatives on Graphene and Human Brain research, and also offers support to the four non-selected pilots to progress towards their goals with adapted means. It does so through a range of activities. In order to enable researchers funded through various sources to work in tight cooperation with each other in the context of the two Flagships, the funding organisations in FLAG-ERA coordinate their funding framework conditions. In order to enhance complementarities and synergies of regional, national and European research programmes and initiatives, the funding organisations share information on these programmes and initiatives, identify gaps and overlaps, and can thus adapt their thematic program and launch new initiatives according to the identified needs. In particular, they can launch transnational calls enabling researchers from different countries to propose joint contributions to the Flagships. Additionally, in order to encourage the actual construction of the Flagships and take-up of their results, the funding organisations organise networking sessions for the research communities and other stakeholders, including industry.The activities in FLAG-ERA are organised around periodic events gathering all stakeholders and structured in sessions dedicated to the various objectives and related tasks of the project.

275,4348,No,Single Chromosome Workshops,"Single chromosome workshops (SCWs) are an important, relatively new development in the global endeavour to map the human genome. They involve a small number of active researchers on a particular chromosome who meet once a year; their purposes are the agreeing of the map to date, the entry of data into GDB, the planning of future strategies to promote closure of the map, and, if appropriate, the sharing of biological materials such as a YAC library of the chromosome in question.   This key activity requires competent coordination. Also the European activities in mapping the human genome have to be adequately represented at these workshops (ie all European scientists with a significant contribution to make will be enabled to participate).   The broad goals of the concerted action are :  to improve the organization of single chromosome workshops (SCWs);  to provide a centralized mechanism for channelling the European participation and contribution, inclusive of support from CEC, for SCWs.  Human gene mappers used to meet every 1 or 2 years at Human Gene Mapping (HGM) workshops, in order to collate work on assigning genes to chromosomes and to construct genetic maps. The tasks of the HGM workshops have been taken over by single chromosome workshops (SCW), which now provide the best means for the international genome community to construct consensus genetic and physical maps of the human genome. HUGO drew up a set of guidelines for the organization of SCWs.   24 SCWs were held in 9 different countries. For all these workshops, HUGO made sure that adequate funding was provided. The SCW coordinator attended the workshops in order to advise on organizational matters, such as the presentation of reports, the submission of data to GDB, and the selection of dates and venus for future meetings.  The achievements of SCWs were reviewed by HUGO staff at the Chromosome Coordinating Meeting where the HUGO guidelines were revised and it was agreed that:  all intending participants must not only be willing to share data, but must have deposited it in GDB prior to the workshop (all data presented at an SCW are considered to be in the pubic domain);  SCW reports should be submitted for publication not later than 1 month after the meeting and funding will be contingent on this;  much more detailed guidance should be provided on data presentation at the workshops. The 8 SCWs held after the HUGO review at CCM92 have all complied with the revised guidelines. The detailed tasks are :  to organize and coorganize 16 SCWs during 1992;  to provide a comprehensive guide to intending organizers of SCWs on how to plan, run and fund such a workshop;  at each SCW to provide advice on: requirements for data entry to GDB, requirements for the report, and location and timing of the next workshop.  to timulate activity on orphan chromosomes (orphan chromosomes are those chromosomes on which, until now, there is no significant mapping activity and which would lead to regular meetings in the form of a SCW).",0,0
942,83872,No,The roles of anaerobic and aerobic microbial processes on nitrogen loss from intertidal and estuarine sediments,"The proposed fellowship will study the roles of anaerobic and aerobic microbial processes on nitrogen loss in estuarine and intertidal sediments. The applicant has 5 years experience in anaerobic microbiology, microbial ecology and environmental biotechnology. He has developed a strong profile, with 19 peer-reviewed papers and over 35 conference proceedings. In order for the applicant to reach his career goals, it is essential that he build on his experience by being trained at a world-leading institute in biogeochemistry.  The overall objectives for the applicant are to: (1) gain complementary scientific experience in micro-sensor development, in situ physiological measurement and mathematical modelling; (2) advance his understanding of biogeochemistry and (3) reinforce his position of professional maturity and establish an independent career.  The science underpinning the proposal is of international importance; the fact that the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process might be important in the oceanic nitrogen cycle has implications for our understanding of global biogeochemical tranformations. Little is known about the factors underpinning this process in sediments and the proposed use of frontline methodologies, including micro-sensor applications and in situ rate measurements using stable isotopes, and excellent host collaborators will put the applicant in a position to make significant scientific and professional advances in this area.  Furthermore, since anammox has been demonstrated to be valuable for exploitation in environmental biotechnologies, such as anaerobic waste treatment, the collation and scale-up of more comprehensive and sophisticated datasets on environmental anammox phenomena will assist in the optimisation and further widespread application of these sustainable technologies.",0,0
1098,30471,No,Using mobile personal telecommunications innovation for the disabled in umts pervasive integration,"To develop proposals for meeting user requirements for applications and services, usability requirements, non-conventional uses supporting social integration; To specify interfaces, in particular common application programming interfaces, to system services; To develop applications and services, taking account of appropriate HCI; To demonstrate the applications and services in a networked environment, eventually evolving towards UMTS type network, using emerging technology and equipment, adapted where necessary. The project has established through its initial trial the requirements for multimedia applications over mobile networks for the specific domain of people with special needs. From this it will base its developments in the interim phase, (services and applications) with a view to future integration with broadband mobile networks such as UMTS. Within ETSI TC Human Factors the project has initiated two new work items concerned with standardisation of text-telephony (a key service for the deaf) and the further analysis of requirements for mobile video telephony. In its interim phase, the project aims to bring a key contribution to UMTS specifications in the standardisation of protocols and services to support the work on human factors. As the standardisation of the UMTS air interface progresses, the results of the project will encourage the exposure of interfaces and services and related QoS requirements needed to support services for special needs. In parallel with this, the role of IN will be demonstrated together with integration of B-ISDN services. Expected Impact Influence on standards for data communications and mobile networking, thus paving the way towards future UMTS implementation.Establish terminal, services and applications that are accessible to, and usable by, all citizens of the EU.Validate networked multimedia applications for people with special needs.  An explanatory note The name of the UMPTIDUMPTI project is derived from an English nursery rhyme about an egg, Humptidumpti:  Humptidumpti sat on a wall, Humptidumpti had a great fall; All the kings horses and all the king's men, couldn't put Humpti together again  This led us to the image below, the smashed egg, representing the fragmented state of mobile services and the problems of providing for special needs (the egg). Putting the egg together is the task of all contributing into the standardisation of UMTS.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Mobile multimedia services for People with Special Needs combining voice, moving pictures, text or other data streams, integration of the users' environment in the personal communications space, control and monitoring at a distance and security. Contribution to the programme The research work of the project is validated through the demonstration of services and applications developed for the disabled and elderly using existing as well as high-speed mobile communications infrastructure. Technical Approach The objectives will be achieved through trials, demonstrating the optimisation to the mobile environment of existing and new applications for special needs and validating their use for a range of impairments. Workshops will be organised throughout the project in order to present results and to obtain feedback from interested communities. The work will build on already existing results, such as IPNSI and proposals made by the MONET project for example. The IBC infrastructure that evolves during the period of the project will enable these results to be extended further, integrating them with advanced mobile services that will appear as UMTS matures. The role of B-ISDN as the core interconnect with the functions of the Intelligent Network supporting access to specialised services is considered to have major influence on the work. In turn, innovative use of services and protocols in wireless mobile networks will generate input into the standardisation of UMTS, focusing on common service specifications and application programming interfaces. A close involvement in the ACTS consensus process will encourage this cycle of development through direct interaction with other projects assuring early validation of their results. Summary of Trial Three series of trials are planned, with mobile communication infrastructure procured through National Hosts and local services. This programme of trialing is continuous throughout the project's duration and includes: an initial phase to remove speculation about the real issues in supporting special needs and based on existing mobile services; an interim phase to incorporate new technologies and services and further develop the cooperation with other projects; and a final phase, expecting to coincide with the commercial deployment of UMTS and enabling the deployment of applications on UMTS platforms, where acceptability, cost benefit and usability are validated. Key Issues Multimedia - the provision of applications containing text, audio and video as well as conversion between these media and representations optimised for special needs; Quality of service - particularly critical in mobile networks, especially when considering interworking with other networks, e.g Internet, ISDN and PSTN; Security - the authentication of called and calling parties by means appropriate to special needs; Interfaces- service specifications in view of eventual integration into UMTS platforms, protocols, especially for data transfer, application programming interface, ergonomics of terminal design; Value-added services- special applications, or assistance provided by third parties, to improve quality of life for special needs.",0,0
541,213780,No,A topological approach to electron correlation in density-functional theories,"Density-functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used method to study the electronic structure of complex molecules, solids, and materials. Its use across chemistry, solid-state physics and materials science is a testament to its black-box nature and low cost. However, many important areas remain inaccessible to DFT simulations, including applications to strongly correlated materials and systems in electromagnetic fields. The topDFT project will deliver new conceptual approaches to design the next generation of density-functional methods. This will be achieved by pursuing three parallel strategies: i) Developing new strategies for the design of functionals ii) Implementing topological DFT, a new computational framework iii) Developing extended density-functional theories.   A new approach to the exchange–correlation problem, based on a perspective from the kinetic energy of the electrons, will be developed – leading to new practical density-functional approximations (DFAs). A new framework for computation will be developed by combining techniques from topological electronic structure methods with DFT, allowing for the identification of correlation ‘hotspots’. This idea is chemically intuitive; electrons close together interact in a fundamentally different way to those far apart. Recognising these hotspots, and adapting dynamically to them, will lead to new DFAs with substantially greater accuracy.   Extended-DFTs will open the way to study strongly correlated systems (e.g. high-Tc superconductors, transition metal oxides, Mott insulators) of importance in chemistry and materials science and magnetic systems (e.g. molecular magnets, spin glasses, spin frustrated systems) of importance in nano-science, advanced materials and spintronics applications.

The material and smart system design process must become part of the complete, integrated, product creation process, requiring the development of an adapted simulation-based Computer Aided Engineering methodology. The objective of this Research Training Network is to develop such modelling framework for designing macro-scale active noise and vibration control applications based on the integration of intelligent, high-performing, material systems. This requires the development of modelling capabilities for the intelligent material systems and sensor/actuator components, for the control systems as well as for their integration in system-level virtual prototyping models, enabling the evaluation of performance as well as reliability and cost aspects. Making this next step in smart systems goes beyond the technological developments. The key requirement is that the various domain specialists on the level of materials, electronics, control systems, design simulation, dynamics, noise, vibration etc, step outside their niche expertise domain and get fully acquainted with the multidisciplinary aspects related to the integration of all these components in industrial applications. Without this, smart structures will remain an academic topic. As such integrated knowledge is at present not available with product and subsystem designers, a multidisciplinary training program is needed and will be developed. A dedicated training course program, a schedule of research exchanges and a well-structured training-through-research program are the basic elements.",0,0
219,102780,Yes,Embedded Intelligent Controls for Buildings with Renewable Generation and Storage,"The ENCOURAGE project aims to develop embedded intelligence and integration technologies that will directly optimize energy use in buildings and enable active participation in the future smart grid environment. The desired energy savings will be achieved in three complementary ways. Firstly, by developing supervisory control strategies that will be able to coordinate larger subsystems (HVAC, lighting, renewable energy generation, thermal storage, etc) and orchestrate operation of the numerous devices in such systems. The energy use will be optimized as a trade-off between occupants comfort, energy costs and environmental impact while considering people’s habits, weather conditions, characteristics of appliances, local generation and storage capacities and market conditions. Secondly, through an intelligent gateway with embedded logic supporting inter-building energy exchange. This brokerage agent will communicate directly with other buildings and local producers to negotiate possible use of the electricity produced locally in their premises. And thirdly, by developing novel virtual sub-metering technologies and event-based middleware applications that will support advanced monitoring and diagnostics concepts. Systematic performance monitoring will ensure the achieved savings are sustained over long period of time without being degraded by deteriorated performance of both mechanical equipment and the monitoring and control system itself. The primary application domains are non-residential buildings and campuses, but the project has relevancy also to residential buildings and neighbourhoods. This will be expressed through several demonstrators comprising public and private office buildings, campus buildings, and private homes. ENCOURAGE aims to achieve 20% of energy savings through the improved interoperability between various types of energy generation, consumption and storage devices; inter-building energy exchange; and systematic performance monitoring.",1,1
107,103101,Yes,Characterisation of hybrid inorganic-organic solar cells by advanced spectroscopic methods,"'The displacement of CO2 emissions by renewable sources of energy critically depends upon the development of low-cost and widely accessible routes to clean energy generation. Of all the renewable energy sources, solar energy has the greatest potential as a world power source. However, the inorganic solar cells available on the market now are too expensive to compete with conventional power sources. Hybrid solar cells are an emerging solar cell technology with a great potential for cheap fabrication. They usually consist of a nanostructured junction of inorganic and organic semiconductors and therefore combine cheap and abundant organic materials with the advantages of inorganic materials in terms of stability and charge transport. Power conversion efficiencies exceeding 3 % have been obtained and there is a large potential for further efficiency improvements. In order to achieve these, a detailed understanding of the working mechanism of hybrid solar cells is of crucial importance. In this project, we therefore aim to carry out an in-depth characterization of hybrid solar cells using a variety of advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques and a multidisciplinary approach. The project will consist of three phases: In the first phase, a state-of-the-art hybrid CdS/polymer system will be characterised in order to gain a better understanding of the working mechanism of the solar cells. Following this, hybrid solar cells consisting of different materials and prepared by different methods will be compared and loss processes in the solar cells will be identified. In the final phase of the project, the gained knowledge will be used to propose new materials combinations, which will lead to the construction of more efficient hybrid solar cells. The proposed project will therefore aim to develop a scientific framework that will enable the custom design of hybrid inorganic – organic heterojunctions for high performance solar cells.'",1,1

Cosmic rays provide a<br/>diagnostic tool to analyze processes in interplanetary space and at the<br/>Sun. Cosmic rays also directly affect the terrestrial environment and<br/>serve as indicators of solar variability and non-anthropogenic climate<br/>changes on Earth. In the fifties of the last century a worldwide network<br/>of standardized neutron monitors was developed to examine temporal and<br/>spatial variations in our space environment.

Therefore the worldwide network, which presently consists<br/>of about 50 stations, ideally complements cosmic ray observations in<br/>space. Since the beginning of the coordinated neutron monitor<br/>measurements the data have been collected in world data centers.

Training and research programs have been developed to manage these challenges but there are still significant losses from fires each year. In 2013 alone, the fire departments in the USA responded to over 1.2 million fires which resulted in about 3,420 civilian fatalities, 15,925 injuries and property losses of about $12.4 billion dollars. In the UK, 192,600 fires responses, approximately 350 civilian fatalities, 10,300 injuries. The firefighting and rescue functions of the existing equipment and apparatus and their dexterity are limited, particularly in the harsh firefighting environments. The SMOOTH project aims to propose a novel robot-assisted decision making system in smart firefighting to perform searching and rescuing practice in the fire ground, and to facilitate the decision makings with higher efficiency.   In the proposed system, a dexterous group of autonomous robots will be ingested, including an Octopus robot developed by SJTU with dexterous robotic upper body developed (with functions of high payload, forcible entry, excavation, obstacle avoidance and sweeping), a group of jumping robots invented by BU and YSU (with functions of obstacle avoidance) and a swarm of capsule systems invented by BU (with functions of precise positioning, narrow openings maneuveration and manipulation). A bunch of novel wearable and environmental sensors will be assembled and equipped on the robots and firefighter’s protection suits to facilitate the real-time machine-to-machine communications. A 3-D human-robot interactions infrastructure will be created to facilitate efficient interactions between human adaptive mechatronics and adaptive networked control.

571,109449,No,Interfacing quantum states in carbon nanotube devices,"Coherent control and sensitive detection of quantum states in condensed matter are among the most topical challenges of modern physics. They drive the development of novel materials, theoretical concepts, and experimental methods to advance our understanding of fundamental laws of quantum mechanics and to create transformative technologies for future applications. During the past decades carbon has emerged as a new material platform to address these challenges: graphene and carbon nanotubes have been created as paradigm systems with exceptional physical properties.  As atomically-thin cylinders carbon nanotubes combine ultra-low mass with extreme mechanical stiffness. This identifies them as perfect candidates for the realization of ultra-high quality mechanical resonators with applications in quantum metrology and sensing. Their crystalline lattice can be made free of nuclear spins by material engineering to ensure ultra-long electron spin coherence times for quantum information processing and coherent spintronics. In addition, semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes exhibit optical resonances with unprecedented tunability in color for quantum communication and cryptography. These outstanding material properties form the basis for our scientific research proposal.  Our vision is to realize up-conversion schemes interfacing light with spin, mechanical, and spin-mechanical degrees of freedom in carbon nanotube devices. In particular, we will study spin dynamics in carbon nanotubes with an isotopically engineered nuclear spin lattice and we will suspend individual carbon nanotubes in high-fidelity optical micro-cavities to detect and control mechanical motion down to the quantum ground state.

245,43696,Yes,Multi Instrument Investigation of Polar Stratospheric Cloud Formati on And The Heterogeneous Chemistry Involved In Stratospheric Ozone Depletion,"The proposal describes a multi-disiplinary approach which seeks to unite stratospheric aerosol data and improved state-of-the-art atmospheric modelling tools in order to investigate polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation and the heterogeneous chemistry involved in stratospheric ozone depletion. The scientific objectives of the proposal are  - to determine the extinction spectrum of PSC particles,  - to quantify the conditions under which polar stratospheric clouds form,   - to model ozone loss in the lower stratosphere,  with the aim of providing information to build a better quantitative understanding of the ozone layer so that the present state of the layer can be explained and its future evolution predicted.The proposal involves the use of measurements from two Arctic and two Antarctic lidar stations, from an airborne lidar, from a nove] in situ backscattering device, from an optical particle counter, and rrom instruments on the 'Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and from the Improv d Lim Arrat Spectrometer (ILAS). The use of such a disparate measurement-dataset is innovative in that it will tightly constrain PSC formation and heterogeneous chemical modelling and avoid biases that can be introduced in single instrument studies. Included in the proposal are fundamental laboratory measurements of PSC particles essential to the interpretation of existing and proposed PSC data. The project aims to develop an innovative inversion algorithm to estimate key PSC properties including surface area density (which will be validated by lidar and in situ measurements) from infrared spectral measurements. A clear advance in this proposal is the sampling of high resolution satellite data along Lagrangian trajectories so that the evolution and decay of a PSC can be examined. In doing so the chemical changes within an airparcel are effectively decoupled from the dynamics allowing a clear picture of PSC formation and heterogeneous processing to be obtained. This technique has only recently become available since the rovision of UARS data and will have wide application to future European atellite instruments. Quantitative understanding of stratospheric proceesses will be expressed within a numerical model of the atmosphere which includes the best possible descriptions of the important physical and chemical processes (PSC formation, heterogeneous processing, ozone depletion) obtained from fundamental laboratory and atmospheric studies.  the work proposed addresses objectives specified in Area 1.2 of the Environment and Climate RTD workprogramme.

In particular, we propose to study the effect of ions, salts and acids on the structural and dynamical properties of the aqueous/vapor interface.  These chemical species have been known to play an important role in various atmospheric processes. Understanding their solvation, propensity and transport at aqueous interfaces is necessary in order to address atmospheric problems resulting from man made chemical processing.  Experimental techniques, such as vibrational spectroscopy, provide only indirect structural information of pure liquids and surface-active solutes in the region of interface. A more direct determination of the interfacial properties can be achieved via molecular simulation.  A caveat in interpreting the results of molecular simulations and comparing them with experiment lies in the accuracy of the representation of the underlying molecular interactions. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, we propose (i) to develop accurate classical models of the intermolecular interactions based on the use of high-level electronic structure calculations (ii) to develop general codes for classical and quantum statistical mechanical simulations and their efficient implementation on parallel computer architectures, (iii) to perform simulations of the structural and dynamical properties of the aqueous/vapor interface with an emphasis on the importance of nuclear quantum effects and (iv) to directly compare our theoretical predictions with experimental (spectroscopic) measurements.",0,0
965,30950,No,Research on New Technologies for Flywheel Electromechanical Storage Systems,"Objectives and content  The presently available batteries and even new types under development are not in the position to meet in a satisfactory way the requirements for application to electric vehicles traction in terms of specific energy and power, life, consistency of performance, efficiency, quick recharging and cost effectiveness.  An integrated Flywheel/motor- generator system, based on advanced technologies, appears to be a feasible mean to meet the requirements, either as a supportive peak power unit integrated with the main energy source or as a full alternative to it, namely as electromechanical battery. Other on board energy supply system like fuel cells or hybrid systems would also require electrically rechargeable supportive power devices.  A feasibility study performed under a previous programme JOULE has shown the possibility to reach energy-weight ratio comparable with the most advanced electrochemical batteries under development (some 130 Wh/Kg) but with much higher specific power, and longer endurance (for life of the vehicle).  To achieve in practice this goal, researches are needed on the key materials and components of the flywheel/motor-generator, including the identification of the related manufacturing processes in order to assure to the final product the adequate level of technical performance and cost.  The present research aims to develop the necessary technologies and related manufacturing processes for the components of high performance Flywheel motor-generator unit and for the identification of the related integration techniques, namely:  -New component materials featuring high performance and low cost -High speed, high efficiency, low cost electric machine and power electronics  -New magnetic bearing solutions  - Integration concepts and techniques among these elements for very compact, reliable and safe electromechanically storage units  The achievements of these technologies will be assessed by means of two Flywheel/motor generator units which will be tested on bench and on vehicle as peak power units. Each unit will feature the preliminary established total energy of 1,6 KWh (stored in 2 counter rotating flywheels), of which 1,2 KWh deliverable from nominal to one half of rotational speed, 60 KW maximum power and weight of approximately 25 Kg.  The manufacturing processes for new composite materials will be defined and all safety features will be tested. In addition the design will be performed for a 'pure flywheel' battery constituted by modules of Flywheel-motor generator units connected in parallel, featuring a specific energy of over 100 Wh/Kg.  A side industrial achievement of the research will be availability of the above mentioned technologies for other applications, either as Flywheel units for stationary or mobile use, or in devices requiring high performance, low cost composite materials or high technology electrical machines and magnetic bearings.

800,42096,No,An ultrasonic level detector for use on canning lines,"The food packaging industry has for some time now made use of an on-line sensor to monitor the level of liquid in cans or bottles after they have been filled on the production line. Such devices generally employ a source of gamma radiation which propagates through the side of each can as it passes. The attenuation of the radiation is measured by a detector on the other side, thus indicating if the can is full at the level of the detector. This system presents two problems; -- The system only detects the presence of liquid at the level of the sensor. A can filled too low will be detected, but a can filled too high will register as being correctly filled. There is no quantitative measurement of the height of the liquid. The utilisation of a gamma emitting isotope presents health and safety problems in the use of the sensor, as well as in disposal of the unit at the end of its working life. There is a need for an alternative detection system which measures the exact height of liquid in each can as it passes on the production line. The possibility of weighing each can is inappropriate for the speed of production lines, and so novel methods should be developed. The proposed system to be developed within this project will incorporate a small waterjet (a few mm high) which will strike the bottom of each can as it passes. This contact will mediate an ultrasonic pulse, which will travel through the bottom of the can, and through the liquid inside. Air is an effective barrier for ultrasound, and the pulse will reflect off the liquid/air boundary. By measuring the 'time of flight' up and down the can, it is possible to calculate the level of liquid inside. Such a system will be considerably safer, more accurate, and much more versatile than the present level detectors.",0,0

In human  health care, veterinary medicine or quality assessment of  food products there exists a growing tendency to  concentrate on the simultaneous detection of several  parameters in one assay. The driving force behind this  kind of multiparameter testing is certainly caused by the  concern of national governments to limit the ever-rising  health care costs.  In order to be able to carry out simultaneous detection  of several parameters on one hand while maintaining the  urge for automatisation on the other, one must be able to  leave the concept of the present devices and concentrate  on miniaturisation.  It is the aim of this project to develop an innovative  processing line for the development of a new generation  of polymer-based micro-sensor arrays for DNA-based and  immunoaffinity type of diagnostics. The end product will  be a cheap, disposable, user-friendly device having the  characteristics of the most advanced microsensors found  to date only in silicon based technology. The idea is  based on the combination of:   micro-injection moulding of polymers to realise a  polymer chip (typ. 2x2 cm2) having a large number (typ.  625) of three-dimensional sub-micron structures with   the oblique evaporation of metals for the definition of  the detector electrodes at these nanostructured sites.  Each of the individual sites of the resulting array of  micro-electrochemical detectors is finally provided with  its specific capturing molecule using a newly developed  micro-spotting instrument. In order to achieve these  goals, a multi-disciplinary team of investigators and  SME's from three different European countries has been  assembled, including specialists in micromachining,  microelectronics, diagnostic molecular biology,  biosensing and biosensor fabrication, and  microdispensing.  The consortium will approach the development of the  processing line for this type of new diagnostic system in  two stages:   The production of a 2x15 detection sites polymer based  array requiring only one metallisation step for the  realisation of the sub-micron electrodes and addressing  the individual detectors. The development of this device  will allow gaining the necessary experience for the  combination of the micro-moulding and oblique evaporation  technique.   The manufacturing of a 25x25-detection site polymer  based array produced with the same basic combination of  micro-moulding and oblique evaporation, but in which the  higher density of detectors requires a multilayer  approach for the addressing of the individual sensor  electrodes.

The proposed consortium involves all competences to face the huge complexity of this process. All academic researchers will gather their expertise to optimize the overall hybrid power chain, starting with electric and thermal components up to system integration by taking into account main environmental constraints. Assessments will be integrated at the system level and will include design and analysis of main components of the hybrid power chain: electric machines and related cooling, cables, power electronics and related thermal management. This system integration will take into account the main environmental constraints, especially partial discharges due to new high power and ultra-high voltage standards. The HASTECS project proposes to reach aggressive targets with a strong increase of specific powers for the main components; We especially target to double the specific power of electric machines from 5kW/kg for 2025 to 10kW/kg for 2035 while specific powers of converters would evolve from 15kW/kg for 2025 to 25kW/kg for 2035: this expected gap, when installing 4 inverter–motor drives of 1.5MW, will lead to a weight reduction of 1.8 tons, which will offer a significant fuel burn reduction estimated at 3.5% for a short range (~300nm) flight. Additional fuel burn reduction will be obtained thanks to several technological steps as on “auxiliary sources” (batteries, fuel cells, etc) and by optimizing the overall system sizing integrating the power management. Recent assessments estimate that the reduction of total energy provided by both Gas Turbines and auxiliaries (batteries of fuel cells) of the most promising electric hybrid architecture may go beyond 20% for a 300nm regional flight!",1,0

FILMCO is a greenhouse film that has already probed to provide the growers with energy consumption savings by 24-28%, and increase their crop production by 20%. FILMCO’s main innovation is the ability to regulate the Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for a given Infrared Radiation (IR), thus controlling the degree of rightness/darkness according to the location requirements. The novel film will have increased robustness, added to higher pesticide and UV and oxidation resistance. The film will create a controlled environment in the greenhouse while lowering energy demands, reducing costs and promoting a better use of resources and higher crop yield. The longer lifespan will also reduce plastic waste and decrease waste management expenses. Although nanotechnology has emerged in industrial applications over the last decades, there is no similar commercial product available in the growing greenhouse agriculture market that matches the benefits and competitive advantages of FILMCO. FILMCO, with TRL 6, is the outcome of a national research project in which Elysee already demonstrated these promising results benefits for growers, so it became a success history.

814,16535,No,LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF VIRAL BIOPESTICIDES IN INSECT CELL CULTURES TO REDUCE WIDE-SPECTRUM INSECTICIDE USE,"Baculoviruses are potentially a valuable, environmentally-safe means of crop pest control. They are capable of infecting, in a highly specific manner, several of the major pest species. Established insect-cell lines and commonly used baculoviruses are poorly suited for biological pest control purposes. Therefore this research project was started in 1993 to:   1. isolate insects and baculoviruses from nature,  2. establish cell lines from the insects,  3. scale-up and optimize insect-cell cultures,  4. produce wild-type baculovirus (PlBs),  5. formulate these PlBs,  6. define dosage and stability of the virus, and  7. use these formulated baculoviruses for field testing in the country of origin of the insects.   Chemical crop protecting agents may impose considerable environmental stress and induce resistance in insects. Therefore, bioinsecticides form a challenging alternative. Especially baculoviruses are of interest, since they are highly specific for the target pest, and no resistance has been reported so far. The aim of this project is the development of an insect-cell-culture process on an industrial scale for the production of a viral biopesticide. Traditionally, baculoviruses are produced in insect larvae. This process is laborious and difficult to scale-up. Moreover, insects are easily contaminated. Modern cell-culture technology facilitates the growth of insect cells in suspension in bioreactors. Successively, those cells may be infected with the extracellular form of the baculovirus, after which the cells will produce the occluded form of the virus (Polyhedra Inclusion Bodies, PlBs) found in nature. New SeNPV and HaNPV strains were isolated from the Iberian Peninsula, and the NPV isolates were characterized. Insecticidal activity of the isolates were determined but no significant differences were found. Two new cell lines, now established, emerged from Se, with optimized growth in serum-free suspension cultures. The existing Se cell line UCR-Se1 (USe) was adapted to different media including serum-free formulations and to growth in suspension as shake flask- and spinner-cultures. Polyhedral Inclusion Body (PIB) production was satisfactorily. Four new Ha primary cell lines emerged, of which one is proliferating fast with a regular cell morphology. The existing Heliothis zea (Hz) cell line was adapted to serum-free suspension cultures. All cells were characterized and distinguished from each other by DNA-fingerprinting using the RAPD-PCR method, and saved in a cell bank. All cell lines were susceptible to AcMNPV virus. The PlBs produced in Se cells are smaller with a larger number per cell. SeMNPV-lnfected Se cells release a low amount of 17 extracellular viruses (ECV) per cell. Serial passaging of SeMNPV in cell culture resulted in deletions in the viral genome already after 1 passage. Tests of PlBs showed a reduced bioactivity already after 3 passages. Storage condition studies showed SeMNPV hemolymph to be relatively unstable. Hemolymph should be stored at -20 or - 80°C. Large scale production of viral biopesticides (of Se and Ha) in serum-free medium was shown in a 66 liter airlift with Se and Hz cells respectively. Shear effects can be minimized by the effective use of airbubbles in airlifts and/or the use of medium additives. Detailed studies at large scale did not show significant scaleup effects. All the cell lines tested showed the same shear sensitivity.   A mathematical model describing the behaviour of insects, formulations and spray applications in the field was constructed, in order to optimise formulations in a targeted way. Due to the variable and time consuming nature of conventional in vivo baculovirus bioassay methods an in vitro test method was developed. The method was used to quantify baculovirus temperature and simulated sunlight inactivation. Correlation with the in vitro method was good for both stress factors. A gain in efficiency and data quality was clearly demonstrated. Temperature stability studies demonstrated that freeze dried HaSNPV remained infectious when stored at temperatures between -80°C and \35°C for at least 50 days (experiment still ongoing). At 50°C there was a rapid loss of infectivity. UV stability studies confirmed that baculoviruses are rapidly inactivated by UV irradiation and that successful baculovirus formulations need to provide effective UV protection. The UV assay system allowed the testing of potential UV protectants and the protective effect of propyl gallate was demonstrated. The infectivity of in vitro and in vivo produced virus was compared using both bioassays. It was shown that there was no difference in inherent infectivity of in vitro and in vivo produced HaSNPV and AcMNPV. Furthermore the extraction and purification of in vitro produced baculovirus was shown to be much easier and with a much higher efficiency compared to in vivo produced virus. The results of a field trial carried out on alfalfa showed no differences in insecticidal activity between in vitro and in vivo produced SeMNPV.   Field test   In the summer of 1995, the formulated virus was field tested in Spain by the University. together with Zenecca. To support the latter activity, a computer application model for the virus was developed.   - difficulty of production: significant progress has been made in developing better, more productive cell lines and practical production systems  - limited choice of strains: new strains of baculovirus, with activity against key European pests, have been identified  - poor formulation and application methodology: new high-throughput systems for evaluating the stability of virus formulations have been developed, as has a model for simulating application to the crop in order to maximise application efficiency.   Exploitation   The total annual world market for all insecticides is about 6 billion ECU, whereas for biologicals this is 150 million ECU, of which baculoviruses account for less than 10 million ECU of sales. The methods developed, for example the TClDso assay, are available for further optimisation of baculovirus formulations. This assay provides a more rapid, reliable and efficient means of assessing baculovirus efficacy. The computer model can be used to examine the effects of numerous factors influencing the efficacy of baculovirus sprays. This includes plants of different forms, being different crops or different cultivars, and different application methods. The whole development process has also suggested the potential of extending similar methods to a wide range of crop protection situations and therefore assist in the rationalisation of herbicide/fungicide/pesticide and formulation development. An economic analysis indicated that at a medium price of around one ECU per liter, virus can be produced in vitro for 4.5 ECU/ha, which compares favourably with an in vivo production, costing 16.2 ECU/ha. Hence, a large-scale production facility will have a significant commercially potential. The University of Cordoba isolated and selected new strains of bacteria (denoted as SeMNPV and HaSNPV), developing a practical bioassay technique to test the biological activity of the viruses, and designing and running field trials with bioreactor-produced virus and testing novel spray formulations. An essential requirement for large-scale production of baculovirus in vitro is an optimal cellular substrate. The Technical University of Darmstadt had to develop those. For the replication of SeMNPV a cell line was available, but not optimized for growth in bioreactors. HaSNPV can be propagated in Hz cells, which had to be adapted to conditions for mass production of cells. Therefore, the development of new cell lines from Se and Ha was a major task within the project. Existing and newly generated cell lines were analyzed with regard to growth characteristics and virus replication and adapted to growth in suspension using low-cost, serum-free media. To optimize the in vitro production of viral biopesticides information is needed about large-scale growth of insect cells and their infection kinetics, which was the task for Wageningen Agricultural University. To facilitate large-scale cultivation of insect cells shear stress shas to be minimized in combination with an adequate oxygen supply. Studies in small airlifts or bubble columns showed that damage of cells is associated with cell bubble interactions. The effect of height, gasflow, cell line and medium composition on the death rate of cells was investigated. To show the possibility of producing viral biopesticides, an existing and a newly established cell line of Se and Hz were used for infection kinetics studies and production of baculoviruses. A major factor which has limited the commercial use of baculoviruses to date has been suboptimal formulation technology. The commerical partner, Zeneca, therefore designed formulations and methods of application.   The Lepidoptera (Noctuidae) species Spodoptera exigua (Se) and Heliothis armigera (Ha) are major pests on important crops like tomato, corn and cotton. Baculoviruses, specific for these insect species, are a potential alternative to chemical pesticides.",0,0

677,94178,No,Sustainable products from economic processing of biomass in highly integrated biorefineries,"Economic and sustainable production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass requires capture of the maximum energy and monetary value from sustainable feedstock. SUPRA-BIO achieves this by focussing on innovative research and development of critical unit operations, by using process intensification to match economic production to the scale of available feedstock and by process integration that provides energy from process waste, optimises utilities to minimise environmental impact and maximises value from the product mix. A technology toolbox for conversion and separation operations is developed that adapts to various scenarios of product mix and feedstock. These are contextualized by full life cycle and economic analysis of potential biorefinery schemes. Based on lignocellulose, microbial/organic waste or microalgae feedstock, innovation and intensification are used to improve the economics and carbon efficiency of fractionation, separation, bio and thermochemical conversions to produce biofuels, intermediates and high value products. Strain selection, genetic manipulation, molecular design and nanocatalysis are used to improve productivity and selectivity; reactor design, intensification and utilities integration for economics. Fermentation to 2,3 butanediol is demonstrated. Mono and multiculture processes are researched for high value products and feedstock streams. Separation is developed for omega oils and specific lignochemicals. Nano and biocatalytic processes are developed for biofuels and bioactive molecules. Integration into potential biorefinery schemes is explored in laboratory pilots of integrated reactors, by piloting on sidestreams, by exchanging separated fractions between partners and by process evaluations.

764,223131,No,Studying the role of Quiescent Cancer Stem Cells in GBM development using a novel in vivo cell cycle-based approach,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive high-grade primary brain tumour in adults. More than 90% of the patients shows recurrence of the disease with a survival of 2 years despite a multitherapeutic approach consisting of a first surgical resection of the brain lesion followed by radio- and chemo-therapy. GBM patients die because of the cancer relapse that evolve becoming not sensitive to the classical therapies. A sub-population of quiescent/slow cycling cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been proposed to be the origin of the cancer relapse. The features and role of that specific population of CSCs within GBM is still not well characterised. The aim of the proposed project is to first clarify the cell cycle state of CSCs within GBM induced in mouse models in addition to their contribution and role in cancer development. To achieve this goal, I will use a cell cycle-based approach together GBM mouse models to: characterise the cell cycle state of CSCs within tumour (Aim 1); analyse the contribution of quiescent and proliferating CSCs during cancer development and their molecular features using a novel cell cycle-based lineage tracing approach (Aim 2); analyse the effect of selective ablation of each CSCs sub-subpopulation in cancer growth a novel cell cycle-based cellular ablation (Aim 3). Using a cell cycle point of view, the obtained results will be fundamental for the definition and the role of the different CSCs co-existing within glioma. In particular, the findings will open new avenue in the study of the role of quiescent or proliferating cells within GBM and give the possibility to others in the field for testing for example which cells contribute to cancer relapse after the initial tumour treatment (mass debulking and following radio- and chemo-therapy) or even design new drugs targeting specific CSC types.",0,0

538,13401,No,COMPARISON OF THE FATE OF X-RAYS AND DNA CROSS-LINKING AGENTS INDUCED LESIONS: FANCONI'S ANEMIA AS A MODEL OF HUMAN REPAIR DEFECT. GENETIC AND BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS,"1.- COMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS BY CELL FUSION IN FANCONI'S ANEMIA. SEARCH FOR COMPLEMENTATION OF DEFECTIVE REPAIR FUNCTIONS BY DNA TRANSFECTION.   2.- INDUCIBILITY OF REPAIR FUNCTIONS IN FA FIBROBLASTS.  Fanconi's anaemia (FA) cells ar hypersensitive to the lethal effect of agents which can form deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) interstrand crosslinks (CL). The increased susceptibility of FA cells can be due to an abnormality in the processing of CL. In vitro studies demonstrate that the successive pathways of CL repair involve several enzymatic activities, including the strand transferase activity of the Rec A protein. Therefore it was logical to study various parameters of recombinational repair in human cells and to focus our work on FA cells. This aim led to the combination of an in vivo study using a nuclear replicating double stranded DNA virus (herpes simplex virus (HSV)) as a probe and an in vitro study allowing us to determine the characteristics of recombination and recombinational repair catalysed by human nuclear extracts.  The extent of multiplicity reactivation (MR) of HSV containing CL in its DNA was tested because MR has been demonstrated to involve recombination between coinfecting viruses and that 1 CL in viral DNA constitutes a lethal lesion in condition of single infection. The main result obtained is the fact that MR of crosslinked HSV is greater in FA than in normal cells. We interpret this as follows: CL in DNA gives rise to double strand breaks (DSB) following replication across it; recombination between cotransfected viral DNA is strongly stimulated by DSB. The increased MR of HSV in FA cells can reflect an accumulation of DSBs resulting from slowed down removal of CL from damaged DNA. The fact that the initial step of CL repair (ie incision) is slower and finally less efficient in FA than in normal cells supports this possibility.  In addition, mutagenesis studies based upon measurements of the mutation rate of HSV towards a tk- phenotype show that the mutation rate is lower for HSV replicated in FA cells than for that replicated in normal cells, and that, in normal cells, the mutation rate is greater in the progeny from damaged HSV repaired by MR than in that from undamaged virus. In FA cells, it remains unchanged.  In accord with data obtained in our group for an endogenous gene such as hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), FA cells exhibit an hypomutator effect towards replicating HSV or reactivating by multiplicity psoralen damaged HSV. Since recombination appears to be an error free pathway in human cell extracts, this may account for the hypomutator state toward HSV in FA cells in as much as recombination is relatively more involved in these cells than in the normal cells.  Our in vitro data show that human nuclear extracts contain proteins promoting recombination between 2 duplex DNAs via single strand exchange which can be reciprocal and also recombinational repair of DSB. Extracts from normal fibroblast cells, SV-40 transformed cells, lymphoblastoid cells and also cell lines derived from human carcinoma (lung, cervix) exhibit comparable levels of activities promoting either recombination or recombinational repair of DSBs.  A comparison of these activities in different cell lines (including FA) and according to their genetic origin is planned. However, it seems to be still premature at this stage. Indeed results indicate that numerous enzymes and proteins are involved in either recombination process. For instance, the catalysis of DSB recombinational repair uses at least endonuclease, helicase, exonuclease (polarity?), possibly strand transferase, DNA polymerase, resolvase and ligase. We do not exactly know the precise participation of the recipient bacteria in the complete process. In this context, it is important to point out that it was suggested that the misrepair of DSB could be due to an excess of exonucleolytic activity in X-rays hypersensitive ataxia telangiectasia cells. Indeed the mere imbalance between the relative amounts of these enzymatic activities could heavily perturb either recombinational process.  In conclusion the availability of more refined tests is required to enable precise comparison of the physiological status of recombination enzymatic machineries in human cell strains expected to present recombination alterations such as FA cells. Progress has been achieved in this direction by determining a method and then developing a device according to which the different proteins of a human nuclear extract promoting the strand exchange reaction can be separated by gel electrophoresis and detected.  Fanconi's anaemia (FA) cells are hypersensitive to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) crosslinking (CL) agents, including psoralen derivatives in combination with near ultraviolet light (UVA). Although incision of CL following posttreatment incubation takes place in FA cells, the processing of these lesions is hampered compared to normal cells; the incision kinetics is slower and the final amounts of CL incised are lower in FA relative to normal cells. FA complementation group A cells are more affected than group B cells both in terms of cell survival and in terms of CL repair. To our surprise in the absence of CL, FA cells showed a higher sensitivity than normal cells to the cytotoxicity of monoadducts (MA) induced by trimethylpsoralen (TMP) and 405 nm, in this case, group B cells being more sensitive than group A cells. Both cell lines have in fact a reduced incision capacity of MA relative to normal cells, this is especially true for monoadducts on the furan side (MAf). Thus, FA cells are altered in the processing of both CL and MA of a specific structural type. In the presence of high amounts of MAf, the incision of CL is blocked and it is only when the proportion of MAf declines the incision of CL can take place. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in FA cells. Such alteration in processing of DNA lesions is associated with hypomutability which suggests a defect in an error prone pathway. By attempting to clone the normal sequences correcting the FA sensitivity to CL agents and by characterising the correcting diffusible factor identified by cocultivation, we hope to unravel the nature of this pathway. THE PROJECT WILL LAST FOR FOUR YEARS AND CONSIST OF TWO PARALLEL PARTS. THE FIRST PART WILL STUDY THE GENETIC CONTROL OF FRANCONI ' S ANEMIA (FA) AND THE CLONING OF THE GENE OR GENES RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIR IN THIS DISEASE.

595,60489,No,Ceramic Components for Industrial Gas Turbines (CERCO),"The continuous increase in performance requirements for gas turbines calls for new materials in the most critical parts. Current superalloy materials are now very close to their physical limits. At present, ceramics materials with their superior temperature capability, offer the best alternative as next generation structural materials for hot section components in innovative design. Possible future benefits of ceramics for gas turbines include the ability to increase the turbine inlet temperature to more than 1400ÐC with uncooled parts. Fully optimised stationary gas turbines would have a ~20% gain in thermal efficiency and ~40% gain in output power in simple cycle compared to all metal engines with air cooled components. Emissions reductions to under 10 ppmv NOx are also forecast. The major critical factors slowing the exploitation of structural ceramics in gas turbine engines include the development of ceramic design technologies, the demonstration of ceramic component reliability in real engines and the further development of materials tailored to meet the specific loading conditions. The overall objective of this project is to improve the performance of stationary small size gas turbines through the selective replacement of metallic hot section components with uncooled ceramic parts.  Specific industrial objectives are: 1. To develop design technologies and know-how suitable to introduce ceramics in real engines. In particular: design of first stage nozzle in monolithic massive ceramic (MC) and of combustor liner and first stage shroud in composite ceramic (CMC); 2. To open the market of industrial gas turbines for CMC-parts through material improvements and successful long time engine tests; 3. On a wider time scale: to prepare the field for introduction of CMC-parts into aircraft engines by material improvements and by increasing the general confidence into long time endurance of CMC in turbine applications.  The approach consists of a component development path (addressing both material and assembly interface issues with compliant layers) and of a CMC-material development path (addressing matrix and matrix-fiber interface): - nozzle and shroud development with full scale testing in a real 5.5 MW engine for 4000 h; - combustor development at reduced scale with 400 h testing in a rig reproducing full loading; - development of oxide-oxide CMC involving fundamental manufacturing technologies such as fibre coating by sol/gel or CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) through a continuous improvement approach based on extensive high temperature testing in the laboratory followed by engine/rig testing on optimised prototypes of shrouds and combustors .The consortium comprises a manufacturer of industrial gas turbine (NUOVO PIGNONE - IT), an aerospace company active in CMC development (DORNIER - DE), an international research center active in interfacial engineering and material testing (JRC/IAM-NL) and an applied mechanics laboratory (UNIVERSITY OF PATRAS-GR).

708,195688,No,ToWards the Identification of Sesquiterpene TransportERs,"Plants synthesize a wide range of secondary metabolites, among them, terpenes. These molecules are notably produced in trichomes which are specialized structures present on the surface of aerial organs. Although the terpene biosynthetic pathways have been well deciphered, their transport across membranes remains poorly understood. This is for instance the case for sesquiterpenes such as artemisinin, an extremely potent anti-malaria drug. Despite the immense benefits of these compounds for plant defenses as well as for human health, no sesquiterpene transporters have yet been identified. It was recently shown that Pleiotropic Drug Resistance (PDR) transporters, which belong to the large ATP-Binding Cassette family, are involved in diterpene transport in Nicotiana tabacum trichomes. Thus, other PDR transporters could transport other types of terpenes such as sesquiterpenes. Recently, two PDR transporters of Artemisia annua, namely AaPDR1 and AaPDR2, have been shown to be specifically expressed in glandular and T-shaped trichomes, respectively. Interestingly, glandular trichomes are known to produce artemisinin while T-shaped trichomes have been shown to produce ß-caryophyllene. Thus, we can hypothesize that AaPDR1 and AaPDR2 transport dihydroartemisinic acid, the artemisinin precursor, and ß-caryophyllene, respectively. In order to examine this hypothesis, this project aims to express these transporters in N. tabacum BY2 cells and characterize their activity using toxicity and transport assays in whole cells as well as direct transport in plasma membrane vesicles. In case our hypothesis concerning the substrates is incorrect, we will rely on a transportomics approach, which consists of running transport assays using metabolites extracted from isolated trichomes as putative substrates. In parallel, as a side project, isolated glandular and T-shaped trichomes will be submitted to quantitative proteomic comparison in order to identify their respective metabolisms.",0,0
935,45832,No,Thermal paper protection by innovative recyclable material,"The thermal paper nowadays in use for labelling food products is subject to degradation processes which make it unreadable after a comparatively short time when submitted to the low temperatures in the refrigerated stockage areas as well as when the products undergo preservation treatments after having been labelled. This has generated a growing demand for coated thermal paper, i.e. resistant to low and high temperature and preserving agents. The particular application to the food industry also involves other self explanatory limitations in the protection techniques used for the production of such 'resistant' thermal papers, that is the use of non degradable, non toxic substrate and coats, since the label itself might and does actually in some case come into contact with the food. Other applications of coated thermal papers are in the mechanical industry, which needs coated thermal paper to label, by bar code, semi-worked items which have to undergo further treatments which normally involve manipulation and lubrication, that is mechanical stress on the label and contact of the inks with lubricating fats which affect the readability of the label. Leisure industry also needs coated thermal paper in particular weather conditions, a typical example of application are the 'skypasses' which must be resistant to low temperatures and frost as well as to manipulations. The main objective of the proposed research is therefore the development of a new European technology to produce coated thermal paper by innovative recyclable materials mainly for use within the food packaging industry, but also with applications within the other sectors previously described. The implementation of the project will allow the involved SMEs to come into the market, roughly one year after thecompletion of the research, with a product which will be competitive in terms of price and environmental impact with a consequent benefit for the European customers, who will be able to buy a European product with equal or better requisites in terms of technical performance at a lower price.

272,65007,No,Efficient traffic control algorithms for traffic information centres,"In traffic information centres data originating from roadside equipment and floating cars should be processed to recognize potential congestion and to suggest adequate routes. We would like to develop novel algorithms that optimize road system from the aspects of both the individual drivers and the whole system. We would like to apply methods, using graph theory and Integer Programming, which proved to work well in telecommunication networks and we intend to modify them considering the following factors: drivers' indeteinable behavior, drivers' reactions on guidance, and traffic characteristics. Heuristics will be developed (based on the idea of Simulated Annealing, Simulated Allocation, or Genetic Algorithm) for the cases when the optimal solution cannot be obtained in acceptable time. The effect of the algorithms will dynamically adapt to the current state of the network and also consider the future state of it, which will be predicted by using earlier stored data. The methods will be integrated in existing system architecture, and its effectiveness tested in a working system. In case of on-line operation the runtime of the algorithms are of crucial importance, thus it will be analyzed by complexity theory, by real scenarios and by simulations. The operation of the algorithms will be examined in existing pilot projects. The proposed research offers an excellent opportunity to widen both my view and knowledge towards traffic telematics and traffic control. The know-how and experience at the host institute and its international connections enable to obtain deep knowledge connected to practical observations. Pilot projects at Arsenal Research with FCD equipped taxis and other vehicles will enable to analyze and test the developed algorithms in practice and examine their behavior in complex systems. I would obtain experience how to participate in EU projects and after the fellowship I would be able to build up or participate in traffic telematics teams in Hungary, for which the need is continuously increasing. Innovative algorithms are expected that can be used in traffic information centres with enhanced network control and route guidance. Apart from the theoretical results a serviceable tool will be implemented. The practical benefits of these results are: higher capacity (throughput) of existing road systems; less traffic jams; and better route suggestions.",0,0
770,195709,No,Investigating the LRRK2-melanin connection through phosphoproteomics of isogenic melanoma cells,"LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein, which uniquely possesses both protein kinase and GTPase catalytic activities. Autosomal dominant mutations of LRRK2 represent one of the principal genetic risk factors for Parkinson’s Disease (PD), which results in preferential loss of neuromelanin containing, dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. The (patho)physiological roles of LRRK2 are currently unclear. However, it has been linked to the regulation of endolysosmal membrane trafficking through complex formation with other PD-related gene-products (Rab7L and Vps35). LRRK2 is also highly expressed in skin pigment cells (melanocytes), which specifically produce melanin within the lysosome-related organelles known as melanosomes, in a process referred to as melanogenesis. Here we propose to examine the substrates and function of LRRK2 in pigmented melanoma cells. We will generate a MNT1 cell panel expressing PD-associated mutations of LRRK2 using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and characterise the respective (phospho)proteomes ±LRRK2 inhibitors from total lysates and from melanosome-enriched fractions using quantitative mass spectrometry. Melanosome biogenesis itself will be compared across the panel using electron microscopic procedures established by the experienced researcher as well as other organelle associated parameters (e.g. contacts with mitochondria) and trafficking pathways linked to Vps35 and Rab7L. The aim is to establish LRRK2 substrates or cellular consequences of activity, which may be specific to melanin-containing cells and link these to PD or to the increased incidence of melanoma observed in PD patients.",0,0

3,95815,Yes,low Energy COnsumption NETworks,"Nowadays, it is widely recognised that the sole introduction of low consumption silicon elements will not be sufficient to effectively curb tomorrow's network energy requirements. Based on this assumption, the ECONET project will investigate, develop and test new capabilities for the Future Internet devices enabling the efficient management of power consumption so to strongly reduce the current energy waste.The ECONET project will be devoted at re-thinking and re-designing network equipment towards more energy-sustainable and eco-friendly technologies and perspectives. The overall idea is to introduce novel green network-specific paradigms and concepts enabling the reduction of energy requirements of wired network equipment by 50% in the short/mid-term (and by 80% in the long run) with respect to the business-as-usual scenario.To this end, the main challenge is to design, develop and test novel technologies, integrated control criteria and mechanisms for network equipment allowing energy saving by dynamically adapting the device capacities and consumptions to current traffic loads and user requirements.The ECONET project will focus its research and development efforts in three main research axes:- In the first axis, novel network-specific HW/FW technologies will be developed to optimise the power management features.- The second axis will be devoted to develop local and distributed frameworks for dynamic optimization of the trade-off between energy consumption and network performance.- The last axis will focus on the design of a Green Abstraction Layer for interfacing the novel low-level green capabilities with OAM frameworks in a common and standard way.The ECONET project will deliver novel energy-aware device prototypes on which large-scale demonstration tests will be conducted.

908,31772,No,Modelling of the impact on ozone and other chemical compounds in the atmosphere from airplane emissions,"The lower stratosphere/upper troposphere are areas of importance for ozone depletion, climate and interaction between chemistry and climate through ozone. Our knowledge of how chemical processes in general, and aircraft emissions in particular, affect the distribution of ozone and other key compounds in these regions is limited. However, with the projected large increase in future aircraft operations and thus emissions, studies of future impact on lower stratospheric/upper tropospheric chemical composition is needed. In order to address these scientific issues the overall objective for the AEROCHEM proposal is the impact of past, present and future emissions from both subsonic and supersonic aircrafts on upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric ozone. The project will contribute to a better scientific knowledge of the processes controlling ozone in height regions where ozone change could contribute significantly to climate change.  The basic tool in this study will be 3-D CTMs (Chemical Transport Models) which have been developed by the   participating groups, and where the emphasis is on processes affecting transport and chemistry in the lower   stratosphere and upper troposphere. The models will have different formulation of chemistry and transport, and   represent state of the art 3-D modelling. As a supplement to the 3-D studies 2-D CTMs with detailed gas phase   chemistry will be used to investigate long term effects of aircraft emissions.   In order to improve our understanding of the key processes identified above in the ozone chemistry, and to   perform realistic 3-D estimates of the past, present and future impact on ozone from airplane emissions, a set   of tasks is selected as necessary parts of the work plan. The tasks of the work plan are outlined below.   Task 1. Preparation of data on emissions and background concentrations   An archive of emissions relevant for modelling the impact of aircraft emissions on the chemical composition   of the atmosphere. Starting point will be the AERONOX data base, which contains present day NOx emissions   from aircraft (ANCAT, WSL, NASA), industry and surface traffic, biomass burning, microbial soil production,   lightning, and stratospheric production (degradation of N2O). Furthermore, the data set will be extended in order   to cover also past emissions and future emission scenarios, in particular aircraft emission scenarios.   Task 2. Perform pilot runs to study model performance   A selected number of runs based on a consistent emission data base established under Task 1 will be performed   with the existing models. The goal is to study how the models perform with regard to ozone generation and   ozone distribution in the region of aircraft emissions, the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Current   emission rate for the source gases will be adopted. Two sets of model studies will be performed: one base run   with the current emissions, and with no aircraft emissions, and one run with the current emissions including   todays aircraft emissions. In the base case the model will be run to give the distribution of trace gases for a one   year period.   Task 3. Sensitivity analysis and process studies   The main goal of these studies is to increase our understanding of how key chemical and physical/dynamical   processes after ozone distribution, and how they can be parameterised in 3-D CTMs, thereby increasing our   ability to predict future changes due to aircraft emissions. Task 4. Calculations of ozone changes due to past, present and future aircraft operations   A set of scenarios of emissions and background concentrations of longlived species will be defined and will be   the basis for the model studies by the different modelling groups. The selection of scenarios to be used in the   model runs will be made to best answer the overall objectives of the project.",0,0
733,201313,No,Characterization of the anaerobic degradation of phenanthrene by a novel sulfate-reducing enrichment culture for the development of bioremediation methods,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely distributed contaminants that produce hazardous effects on human health. They are persistent in the environment and recalcitrant to degradation, rendering the development of efficient PAH-removal methods a worldwide concern. In PAH-contaminated aquifers or sediments, oxygen is depleted very rapidly, thus microorganisms able to use these compounds as a carbon source in the absence of molecular oxygen are crucial for their consumption. The aim of this project is to elucidate the enzymes and mechanisms for the anaerobic degradation of phenanthrene by a novel sulfate-reducing enrichment culture. The first objective is to identify the organisms responsible for phenanthrene degradation. A phylogenetic characterization will be performed by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes amplified from the enrichment culture. The second objective is to discover the enzymes involved in the degradation process. To this end, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic evaluation of the enrichment culture will be performed. The functionality of the identified enzymes will be then evaluated in vitro. The chemical stability and complicated structure of phenanthrene promises the discovery of novel types of enzymatic reactions. Finally, the microorganisms responsible for phenanthrene degradation will be purified to homogeneity and characterized to evaluate the optimal environmental conditions for growth and phenanthrene degradation. Options to improve biodegradation at contaminated sites and to promote phenanthrene removal will be studied. The project proposes insights into the anaerobic biodegradation of three-ring PAHs as one of the most prominent classes of environmental contaminants.",0,0
718,206134,No,Cracking the epitranscriptome,"Over 100 types of distinct modifications are catalyzed on RNA molecules post-transcriptionally. In an analogous manner to well-studied chemical modifications on proteins or DNA, modifications on RNA - and particularly on mRNA - harbor the exciting potential of regulating the complex and interlinked life cycle of these molecules. The most abundant modification in mammalian and yeast mRNA is N6-methyladenosine (m6A). We have pioneered approaches for mapping m6A in a transcriptome wide manner, and we and others have identified factors involved in encoding and decoding m6A. While experimental disruption of these factors is associated with severe phenotypes, the role of m6A remains enigmatic. No single methylated site has been shown to causally underlie any physiological or molecular function. This proposal aims to establish a framework for systematically deciphering the molecular function of a modification and its underlying mechanisms and to uncover the physiological role of the modification in regulation of a cellular response. We will apply this framework to m6A in the context of meiosis in budding yeast, as m6A dynamically accumulates on meiotic mRNAs and as the methyltransferase catalyzing m6A is essential for meiosis. We will (1) aim to elucidate the physiological targets of methylation governing entry into meiosis (2) seek to elucidate the function of m6A at the molecular level, and understand its impact on the various steps of the mRNA life cycle, (3) seek to understand the mechanisms underlying its effects. These aims will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how the epitranscriptome, an emerging post-transcriptional layer of regulation, fine-tunes gene regulation and impacts cellular decision making in a dynamic response, and will set the stage towards dissecting the roles of m6A and of an expanding set of mRNA modifications in more complex and disease related systems.",0,0
129,213875,Yes,Smart Energy Management System,"Stignergy brings to the market a pioneering Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) based on bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence that intends to disrupt in the field of electrical efficiency and control for industrial consumers (which typically represent in EU more than 68% of all electricity consumed) with a drastic reduction in the demand and consumption of electrical energy, while facilitating the deployment of renewable energies. Its main benefits stem from (1) reducing up to 15% on the electricity costs, (2) decreasing the associated CO2 emissions (1.5%), (3) maximizing the self-consumption of green electrical energy (solar, wind)  locally produced, and (4) contributing to stabilize the electricity distribution networks for providers. To complement these benefits we propose two unprecedented features: (1) an Energy Storage Management module, which will maximize the self-consumption of green sources of energy from a Battery Storage Energy System and (2) a Smart Grid Integration module, which will provide a virtual charge to balance the energy demand/response of electricity providers. The existing control technologies do not include any intelligence to implement an efficiency energy plan, and are mainly focused on centralized tools which are difficult to install and entail high initial investment and labour costs. Besides, no solution enables to predict the peak demand and maximizes the self-consumption of local green electrical energy. To ensure the viability of SEMS we will assess its technical, commercial and financial feasibility and the IPR exploitation, and define our Business Plan so as to achieve the market uptake in the targeted European countries in 2020. SEMS is aligned with the goals of the EU Horizon 2020 WP for Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy and the energy targets for 2030 by helping reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint by smart and sustainable use of electricity, promoting the use of low-cost, low-carbon electricity energy sources.",1,1
602,5177,No,Physico-chemical forms of aluminium in non-equilibrium aquatic systems and related biological effects,"To increase the understanding of chemical/geochemical processes influencing biological systems in aquatic mixing zones under severe dis-equilibrium conditions due to acidity vs. liming.   Liming is extensively used in the restoration of acidified lakes and rivers, not only to increase the water pH and alkalinity, but also to reduce the amount of 'toxic' aluminium species to fish and other sensitive organisms. Recent field studies have documented Al-toxicity to fish in the mixing zones between limed streams and acid tributaries. The conditions of severe chemical dis-equilibrium present within such mixing zones appear to result in enhanced toxicity for fish; rates of mortality are higher than in the original acidic waters.  This project, therefore, will address the questions concerning the chemical/geochemical processes leading to enhanced toxicity towards fish in mixing zones between neutral or limed rivers and their acid tributaries. The chemical studies will include aluminium speciation, transformation processes and the kinetics involved. These investigations will be complemented by biological and physiological studies on possible toxic mechanisms responsible for the observed fish mortality.  Experiments will be carried out in the field in two catchments in Norway and Scotland during different seasons (different hydrology, temperatures, and life stages of fish) and in laboratories under controlled exposure (Norway, UK, Belgium, and in the Netherlands). The experiments will focus on:  - the characterisation of Al species by fractionation techniques, and trace element analysis; - transformation processes and kinetics involved, especially the polymerisation of 10w molecular weight Al-species; - interactions with other components influencing the polymerisation of Al species, in particular silicic acid, calcium fluoride and humic substances; - identification of biological responses, especially sublethal effects and fish mortality; - improvement of management practices for countermeasures taken in acidified water systems, e.g. liming of rivers and waters for agricultural practices.",0,0
453,186816,No,Cyber Security and Resilience of Networked Critical Infrastructures,"'Modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCIs), e.g. the electrical grid, rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for their operation since ICT can lead to cost reduction as well as greater efficiency, flexibility and interoperability between components. In the past NCIs were isolated environments and used proprietary hardware and protocols, limiting thus the threats that could affect them. Nowadays, with the adoption of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) ICT, NCIs are exposed to significant cyber threats that can lead to economical and human losses.  To address the aforementioned issues, this project aims at elaborating novel holistic methodologies for the design of security and resilience-aware ICT infrastructures for NCIs. The project will develop state-of-the-art techniques and tools to aid engineers in designing secure and resilient industrial ICT-based installations.  The novelty of the project consists in the fact that it will fuse together the cyber and physical dimensions of NCI, an important aspect that is missing from existing approaches. The project will create novel NCI network design techniques by solving multi-criteria optimization problems that take into account several aspects such as NCI design standards, e.g. NIST SP 800-82 and NERC CIP 002-009, resilient operation of physical process, but also installation-specific information, e.g. geographical aspects. The project will also provide more effective protection mechanisms, e.g. cyber-physical Intrusion Detection Systems, by combining data from cyber and physical sensors.  The proposed research lies in the context of the 'European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection' (EPCIP), the 'Critical Information Infrastructure Protection' (CIIP) action plan and the 'Digital Agenda for Europe' (DAE) by addressing key security and resilience issues of NCIs that will ultimately lead to the better protection of existing and future Critical Infrastructures.'",0,0
716,35425,No,Catalysts for Activation of Light Paraffins by Selective Oxidation,"Foreseen Results  If successful, the project will result not only in a better understanding of the studied reactions and improved catalysts for them, but also in the creation of new links of cooperation and a broader integration of research centres in a full European scale. The present project is aimed at developing basic and precompetitive knowledge for the design of new catalysts for the selective oxidative activation of propane and isobutane. The increasing demand of these light paraffins and the need of fairly pure feedstocks for their petrochemical use might cause the present capacity to become insufficient to cope with it. On the other hand, these paraffins are relatively abundant in refiner streams, being inexpensive and at present mostly used as energy carriers for combustion. Therefore, the objective of this joint research project would be the study and development of new catalysts for the selective oxidation of propane to acrolein and the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of isobutane.  The following stages are proposed to reach this goal:  a basic study of catalysts, suitable for the target reactions (OXD of isobutane and propane to acrolein) based on this knowledge, the further development of catalysts through the optimization of catalyst preparation methods; catalyst formulations; the process operating variables for each target reaction.  The first stage will include the synthesis of bulk or supported mixed oxide phases, as well as metal oxide-zeolite mixed systems, and the screening of their catalytic properties for the target reactions. The OXD of propane will also be studied on the same catalysts as a tool to obtain mechanistic information by comparison with these reactions. Simultaneously, the physico-chemical properties of the most promising systems will be studied by various 'in situ' techniques to identify the real active sites and to understand the mechanism of reaction. Based on this knowledge, in the second step, the tuning of the catalytic active sites will be attempted by preparing biphasic catalysts.  This research programme will be carried out by six research centers, two from EU states, two from the CCE and two from the NIS.

697,398,No,THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND EUROPEAN ECONOMIC GROWTH : A COMPARATIVE INPUT-OUTPUT STUDY FOR THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM,"The project studies how economic structural change has brought about increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and how economic structural change may be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the next 20 years. The principal analytical technique used was in input output analysis. This has the benefit that an economy can be studied in terms of many interacting productive sectors.  This study is prompted by the growing concern of the likely environmental impact of global warming, because of the increasing emission of carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse' gases.  An outline is given of the history of carbon dioxide emissions. There is evidence that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase the risk of major global climate change. The rate of increase of World carbon dioxide emissions is presently about 2% per annum which is down from 5% per annum in the early 1960s. Although this is an encouraging trend, it indicates the importance of adopting global policies to reduce, and reverse, this rate of increase of carbon dioxide emissions. The World energy/output ratio is falling at about 2% per annum, while the carbon dioxide/energy ratio is roughly constant. This is encouraging, indicating that global economic growth does not necessarily need to be sacrificed in thepursuit of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. For the European Community (EC) carbon dioxide emissions have been falling at about 2% per annum in recent years. This is twice the rate of reduction necessary to meet the modified Toronto target and in recent years the energy/output ratio has been falling at about 4% per annum, while the carbon dioxide/energy ratio has been relatively constant. This has been consistent with sustained growth in gross domestic product of about 2% per annum.  The project studies how economic structural change has brought about increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and how economic structural change may be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the next 20 years. The principal analytical technique used was in input output analysis. This has the benefit that an economy can be studied in terms of many interacting productive sectors.  This study is prompted by the growing concern of the likely environmental impact of global warming, because of the increasing emission of carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse' gases.  An outline is given of the analysis of carbon dioxide emissions. German carbon dioxide emissions have been falling at about 1.5% per annum since the late 1970s. This can be attributed to a falling energy/output ratio and a falling carbon dioxide/energy ratio. At the same time, gross domestic product (GDP) growth of more than 2% per annum has been achieved. United Kingdom carbon dioxide emissions have also been falling, at about 1% per annum, since the late 1970s. This can be attributed to falling energy/output and carbon dioxide/energy ratios. This has allowed GDP growth of about 2% per annum to be maintained and carbon dioxide emissions attributable to fuel use in production have been falling in both countries. Also carbon dioxide emissions attributable directly to household fuel use have been approximately constant since the late 1970s, in both Germany and the United Kingdom. For the United Kingdom there is evidence that, while most sectors are becoming more efficient in their use of energy, there is evidence of significant worsening energy efficiency in the transport sector and since 1981 in the United Kingdom, when the changing mix of producing sectors is taken into account, there has been an overall worsening in the efficiency of generating GDP from energy. The observed structural changes, changes in carbon dioxide emissions overtime, and the results of scenario analyses, are very similar for Germany and the United Kingdom. Therefore, conclusions can be drawn for other industrialized countries; For both Germany and the United Kingdom, the proportion of carbon dioxide emissions attributable directly to the domestic final demand for fuels has been increasing, from about 20% in 1968 to about 30% in 1988 and a large proportion of the direct plus indirect carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to mineral oil processing; electricity; chemical products. When imports and exports are properly accounted for, both Germany and the United Kingdom are responsible for less carbon dioxide than they actually emit. For both countries, there is evidence that while there has been some improvement in the efficiency of energy use in production, there is less evidence for such efficiency improvements in the direct use of energy by households, government expenditure and investment and for both countries, there is evidence that the rise of the 'service' industries has led to a fall in total carbon dioxide emissions, but the German mix production is less carbon dioxide intensive than the United Kingdom mix. The 'minimum disruption' approach can be taken to alterations in economic structure, to achieve target carbon dioxide emission reduction rates. This allows identification of those carbon dioxide reduction measures which give 'minimum disruption' to the economic structure, while still attaining target rates of, for example, GDP growth and employment growth.  The project studies how economic structural change has brought about increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and how economic structural change may be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions over the next 20 years. The principal analytical technique used was in input output analysis. This has the benefit that an economy can be studied in terms of many interacting productive sectors.  This study is prompted by the growing concern of the likely environmental impact of global warming, because of the increasing emission of carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse' gases.  An outline is given of the scenario analysis for carbon dioxide emissions. In the absence of economic growth, the introduction of best practice technologies of energy use in production would lead to carbon dioxide emissions falling by about 1.4% per annum in both Germany and the United Kingdom. Best practice technologies in household energy use would lead to carbon dioxide emissions falling by about 0.6% per annum in both countries. Therefore the total rate of decrease of carbon dioxide emissions, with the introduction of best practice technology and in the absence of economic growth, would be 2% per annum.  The complete substitution of coal by gas in both countries would, in the absence of economic growth, lead to a 'once off' reduction in total carbon dioxide emissions by about 11%. The substitution of gas for coal only in electricity generation leads to a 'once off' reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by about 7 to 8% for both economies. These reductions of carbon dioxide emissions are, however, insufficient to meet the Toronto target.  Given an overall growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) of 2% per annum with a higher growth rate in the services (4% per annum) and food (6% per annum) sectors, and a lower rate of growth in the remaining sectors, an improvement in efficiency of energy use by industry and households of about 2% per annum and a switch to renewable energy sou rces by about 1% per annum are sufficient to meet the Toronto target. This is true even with the phasing out of nuclear power.  From the application of the 'minimum disruption' approach to sieriario analyses, it seems that the necessary changes to meet the Toronto target for carbon dioxide emission reduction, for the production side of the economy, are close for those already being achieved. This is particularly true for fuel substitution. Also, the 'minimum disruption' changes in the structures of final demand compatible with reaching the Toronto target, maintaining GDP growth at 2% per annum, and maintaining full employment are demanding, but not too dissimilar from the historical trends observed. One of the major problems facing the world today is the 'global greenhouse' effect, with its threat of major and potentially catastrophic climatic disruption. This effect is caused principally by the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the combustion of fossil fuels. The reduction of CO2 emission by the European Community may need to become a high priority in the coming years. However, this may have very detrimental effects on economic growth in the Community. This proposal is to study the economic determinants of the emission of CO2 in the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom, over the past 30 years, using an input-output approach. This would show how changes over time, and inter-country differences, can be attributed to the changing level and structure of final demand (gross domestic product), the pattern of inter-industry trading, and the technology of fossil fuel use in the various industrial sectors. This would form the basis for the generation of scenarios of future patterns of production, consumption and fuel use within the Community, allowing the investigation of how CO2 emission might be reduced, and of the corresponding impact on economic growth .",1,0

48,45105,Yes,DEMONSTRATION OF A BED MIXING DRYER FOR WET BIOMASS SAVING FUEL IN ENERGY PRODUCTION,"The Bed mixing dryer project aims : 1. to reduce the cost and environmental impact of energy production, 2. to improve the reliability of the Dryer technology, 3. to assist its application integration and penetration in the energy market and, 4. to promote the use of the economically competitive technology using wet biomass as fuel for power/heat generation. The objective is to realise this demo project at a commercial scale based on innovative technologies. The dryer is designed to produce 6MWth district heat and the annual monetary value of energy saving is estimated to 3.8 MSEK/a.  The project will advance and implement innovative new technologies, which have no commercial applications yet. The research and development stage has been completed. A pilot plant has been built inside the IVO Group in Kuusamo. The technology of the Bed mixing dryer is suitable for power plants utilizing fluidized bed combustion for combined heat and power production (CHP) or solely power generation. The technology is patented by IVO in Finland and a patent application is pending in other countries, too. The construction of the dryer is very simple, the idea is to utilize the heat of the hot bed material of the fluidized bed for drying the fuel and to recover the latent heat in the formed vapour. The possibility to utilize the energy used for drying makes the bed mixing dryer profitable. The heat is transferred in direct contact between the hot bed material, the steam and the wet fuel, which means that no exchangers are required for the drying phase. The moisture of the fuel does not go through the boiler, which reduces the amount of flue gases. This reduces the size and investment costs of the boiler in new investments while the capacity of existing boilers can be increased. Summary of the advantages and innovative aspects of the bed mixing dryer: - High overall thermal efficiency due to the recovery of latent heat back to the process - New plant: Smaller boiler size when the amount of moisture in the boiler is reduced - Old plant: Increased capacity - Simple construction when no heat exchangers are required for the drying phase - Significant savings in CO2, NOx, SO2 emissions, because burning of other fuels are avoided by utilizing wet biomass as fuel - No risk for fire due to the inert atmosphere - Easy to control by changing the bed material flow. The dryer is connected to the existing CFB boiler of Öbrero Energy. The fuel capacity of the boiler is 165 MW and the amount of fuel fed through the dryer can be up to one third of the maximum amount of fuel at full load.",1,1

730,87763,No,Cell permeable peptides as drug delivery system: a way towards innovative therapeutic strategies for neurodegeneration,"Peptides and small molecules able to modulate protein-protein interaction as well as intracellular pathways leading to neurodegeneration and cell death hold a great potential as innovative therapeutic strategies with which to probe and manipulate biological pathways. The need to deliver these biologically active agents into cells has encouraged to develop various transducing vectors.  In this view, cell permeable peptides conjugates represent a novel, versatile and extremely powerful way of blocking the propagation of intracellular signaling events or intracellular protein complexes, thus being an useful tools for both creating innovative animal models and to design innovative therapeutic strategies. The project aims to foster a dynamic pathway between academic research organizations and private commercial enterprises based on a longer term co-operation programme in the field of innovative therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. The project will focus on the following specific objectives:  i) Identify and verify appropriate targets, making use of innovative animal models to develop blocking/inhibitory small molecules; ii) Design appropriate cell permeable peptides and develop proteases resistant vectors.

20,2441,Yes,Study of offshore wind energy in the European Community,"To assess the potential of offshore wind energy in the European Community.  In order to make a quantitative assessment of the European Community (EC) offshore wind energy resource, 3 broad data categories are required: long term wind speed data (mean, Weibull parameters, shear profile to estimate energy available per unit of sea area); other environmental factors (long term and extreme wave height data, temperature, icing, etc); siting constraints (distance to shore, mean water depth, seabed soil conditions, seabed slope, shipping lanes, military zones, maximum currents, extreme wind speed, extreme wave height, fisheries and dredging, icing, marine conservation areas, protected wrecks). Much of these data are available from standard nautical charts, such as published by the hydrographic offices of several European countries.  It was decided to present and analyse the data using a geographical information system (GIS). GIS software enable the users to import, export, display and manipulate encoded spatial datasets such as digitized charts.  It was decided to purchase Idrisi which is the most used GIS worldwide, runs on personal computers (PC), and offers a very flexible range of modular data import export, analysis and display routines. However, rasterised datasets require large amounts of storage.  Analytical tools which are capable of investigating the effects of both wind and wave loading of offshore wind turbines have been developed. This work has involved the extension of well validated in house methods for dealing with land based machines to enable analysis of the wind turbine response due to hydrodynamic loading of the offshore support structure. 2 separate and equally important methods of analysis have been developed: time domain analysis (A model of the complete offshore wind turbine has been developed based on a modal description of the coupled rotor tower structural dynamics. The model has now been commissioned and is in use for analysis of the extreme wave loading of the wind turbine); frequency domain analysis (A sta ndard approach to the loading analysis of offshore structures is to model the variation of wave height for a particular sea state as a spectrum and apply this to a freqency domain representation of the structural dynamics. This approach is particulary valuable in the context of fatigue analysis of offshore structures. Development and commissioning of the frequency domain tools is almost complete). A 2-bladed, 100 m diameter, 6 MW wind turbine for installation offshore, has been chosen as a reference wind turbine for the present project although variations on the design will be considered as the project progresses. Published details of the wind turbine design have been used to enable a models of the machine to be developed. To date this work has involved the design of the rotor geometryand structure around the data available, a modal analysis of the rotor and support structure and assembly of the data files required for loading and response analysis of the machine. Further work is required to determine realistic power train and pitch control system characteristics.  Extreme wave loads for single column and tripod support structures at 3 sites have been evaluated. At each site a maximum wave height and 3 wave periods have been considered. The extreme wave loads have been applied to the wind turbine model and the response evaluated in the time domain.  Preliminary results suggest that the loading of the rotor is largely unaffected by wave loads applied to the support structure. The loading of the support structure is, however, almost entirely associated with wave loading.  Further work is underway to investigate the extreme wave loading of the wind turbine for other wind speeds including those at which the machine is nonoperational. The large scale exploitation of wind energy is likely to be limited by environmental constraints. It is therefore of considerable interest, particularly for densely populated European countries, to explore the  possibility of offshore wind farms. Furthermore, the mean wind speeds found offshore are considerably higher than those on land and the turbulence intensity and thus the wind loads experienced by the machines are lower. The attraction of offshore wind farms is therefore both technical and environmental.   The intention of this project is to undertake an exploratory study covering the following four topics:   1) The feasibility and potential of offshore wind energy in Europe which will be summarized in an atlas.   2) To review existing information on offshore construction erection and maintenance with regard of offshore wind farm operations.   3) To provide design guidelines for offshore turbines specifically accounting for the marine environment.   4) To consider the impact of the combined wind, wave and ice loading.",0,1

236,204303,Yes,SMART MODULAR UNDERFLOOR HEATING SYSTEM FOR ENERGY AND THERMAL COMFORT OPTIMIZATION,"Large portion of buildings energy consumption from space heating is wasted. Poor indoor temperature control, low heating energy efficiency or lack of insulation are the main causes of the energy loss. This is critical in cold climate office buildings where space heating consumption accounts for up to 50% of the yearly building energy consumption. Moreover, indoor environmental and personal factors (thermal comfort), are strongly linked to energy efficiency in buildings and to productivity of occupants. Combined  energy-comfort approaches in space heating are needed in order to guarantee high indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency. To meet this challenge,  integration of the Internet of the Things and space heating technologies for buildings represents a huge business opportunity still not exploited in terms of energy savings from higher comfort levels. Overall objective of PLACTHERM is to accelerate the market uptake of PlacTherm®, a smart modular underfloor heating system based on Exploded View patent pending technology that fully merges underfloor heating (UFH) and Internet of the Things technologies in a stand-alone solution. PlacTherm® enables buildings to achieve maximum energy savings and indoor comfort levels by untapping the benefits from having one single room covered by over 200 single temperature and pressure sensors and heating sources, enabling each occupant to have their own temperature of comfort, and reducing the energy for heating empty areas. PLACTHERM will generate impact at different levels: - society: lower environmental impact from the buildings - economic performance of the energy bill payers - health of building occupants: increase in their thermal comfort/wellbeing at their workplaces and consequently increasing their productivity - Exploded View competitiveness, turnover and staff headcount, becoming a worldwide reference in smart and energy efficient space heating solutions based on the zonification to avoid overheating.",1,1

657,213541,No,PEMFC based on platinum Group metAl free StrUctured cathodeS,"PEMFC is the fuel cell predilection technology for automotive applications with a large deployment horizon by 2025-30. However, the increasing use of fuel cell electrical vehicles is expected to lead to a quickly growing demand for Platinum Group Metals. PGM production is not only itself related to negative environmental impacts but also raises questions of long-term availability due to the limitation of reserves and Europe’s economic dependence on the countries of the materials’ origin. Hence, it is of strategic importance that the transition to PGM-free catalysts is made as quickly as possible to ensure Europe's competitive position and to reduce market pressure on the use of scarce noble metals. In that perspective, PEGASUS is exploring the removal of Pt and other critical raw materials and their replacement by non-critical elements enabling efficient and stable electro-catalysis for performing and durable PEMFCs. The overall aim of the project is to bring up the experimental proof of concept for novel catalysts with five underlying objectives supporting a full validation at single cell scale with a focus on the cathode side: 1) High performance, 2) durable and 3) low cost MEA using non-PGM catalysts-based cathode; 4) Robust test protocols for catalysts screening and 5) Understanding of degradation and prevention & mitigation strategies through a MEA design-driven approach. PEGASUS will benchmark (Metal-Nitrogen-Carbon) materials with variants of Carbon supports and Catalyst Layer designs in order to reach the best compromises between chemical activities and mass/charge transfer with the support of intensive experimentation and modelling.

152,212771,Yes,4-Colours/2-Junctions of III-V semiconductors on Si to use in electronics devices and solar cells,"It was early predicted by M. Green and coeval colleagues that dividing the solar spectrum into narrow ranges of colours is the most efficient manner to convert solar energy into electrical power. Multijunction solar cells are the current solution to this challenge, which have reached over 30% conversion efficiencies by stacking 3 junctions together. However, the large fabrication costs and time hinders their use in everyday life. It has been shown that highly mismatched alloy (HMA) materials provide a powerful playground to achieve at least 3 different colour absorption regions that enable optimised energy conversion with just one junction. Combining HMA-based junctions with standard Silicon solar cells will rocket solar conversion efficiency at a reduced price. To turn this ambition into marketable devices, several efforts are still needed and few challenges must be overcome. 4SUNS is a revolutionary approach for the development of HMA materials on Silicon technology, which will bring highly efficient multi-colour solar cells costs below current multijunction devices. The project will develop the technology of HMA materials on Silicon via material synthesis opening a new technology for the future. The understanding and optimization of highly mismatched alloy materials-using GaAsNP alloy- will provide building blocks for the fabrication of laboratory-size 4-colours/2-junctions solar cells. Using a molecular beam epitaxy system, 4SUNS will grow 4-colours/2-junctions structure as well as it will manufacture the final devices. Structural and optoelectronic characterizations will carry out to determine the quality of the materials and the solar cells characteristic to obtain a competitive product. These new solar cells are competitive products to breakthrough on the solar energy sector solar cells and allowing Europe to take leadership on high efficiency solar cells.",1,1
991,42453,No,Forced response of turbomachinery blades,"Research objectives and content  This proposal deals with the vibration analysis of turbomachinery rotor blades which are subjected to time-varying aerodynamic forces produced by the gas flow past the stator blades, the industrial term for the phenomenon beingforced response. State-of-the-art analysis and design tools for estimating such aeroelastic behaviour are deficient in terms of predicting blade response levels quantitatively and hence blade fatigue life cannot be assessed to a required degree of accuracy. It is therefore proposed to develop a numerical predictive model with the following features: (i) accurate modelling of the unsteady flow including wake behaviour and gust response, (ii) structural model including non-linear friction damping, (iii) flexible rotor blades and their effect on the flow, and (iv) adequate representation of blade cooling.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  The objective of the project is to acquire a deeper knowledge and a wider competence in the field of fluid-structure interaction in a turbomachinery environment. This is multidisciplinary topic in which the applicant has a good basic knowledge and for this reason the benefit and the expected impact can only be positive.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  The work will take place at the Centre of Vibration at Imperial College which is a Centre of Excellence in these studies.

415,92011,No,ASPIS - Autonomous Surveillance in Public transport Infrastructure Systems,"The present proposal aims at the development of a prototype surveillance system based on autonomous, smart monitoring devices that capture data only upon the occurrence of an incident, potentially dangerous for the pas-sengers (like an explosion blast or the triggering of the fire detector). When triggered, these devices propagate the triggering to their neighbouring de-vices and send an alarm. Successively, they upload the captured data to the central station providing a wide (space and time-wise) coverage of the potentially hazardous incident. Finally, they provide a dedicated bi-directional communication channel between the emergency centre and the affected areas. If, for any reason, they don’t succeed to establish com-munication, they serve as “black boxes”, preserving the data until they are physically recuperated by the authorities. This innovative system is meant for the unattended surveillance of public transport and other public spaces. It serves primarily for the prompt and reli-able situation awareness during the early, most critical emergency phase, thus greatly facilitating the overall crisis response.  ASPIS promises to overcome the drawbacks of classical, centralized surveil-lance by offering a prompt and wide coverage, space and time-wise, on events potentially hazardous to public safety in a cost-effective way without being excessively intrusive to the individual activities. In fact, it constitutes a very good compromise between the need for surveillance / monitoring and the respect of privacy and civil liberties of the citizens. The proposed system will be modular both in terms of triggering and com-munication capabilities, so as to be of very wide applicability and utilise / complement any existing suitable infrastructure. A system based on blast and fire detector triggered monitoring devices is proposed as a first implementa-tion, aiming at the protection of surface means of public transport from events involving explosions or fire.",0,0
305,72298,No,HAPtic sensing of virtual TEXtiles,"The rapid development of Virtual Reality has been very impressive during the past 15 years. However the main focus so far has been on visual perception, supported by developments in computer graphics. Clearly, humans have more senses beyond vision and there have been considerable attempts to integrate jointly acoustic and visual perception channels. Despite the previous achievements, the progress in VR systems as to incorporating haptic perception in a multimodal interaction paradigm is far less satisfying and still at the beginning. As an illustration for this new research on multimodal interaction, we choose as example 'Multimodal perception of textiles in the virtual environment'. HAPTEX proposes to develop new avenues for research that enable a person to perceive, touch and manipulate textiles. Significant advances in existing technology are necessary in order to integrate the visual and haptic/tactile interfaces to achieve the complete virtual experience of a physical object. The main research issues are: Development of physics based techniques to model the behavior of textile; Development of a visual model that enables realistic rendering of the textile; Design of an interface that enables both tactile and haptic rendering; Synchronization of the multiple sensory feedback to create a consistent and physically possible experience. Each of these individual problems is very challenging and will lead to the development of novel techniques in the respective areas. HAPTEX provides a platform for experts in these individual areas to work in conjunction with each other to reach a common goal of generating a realistic, efficient multimodal experience. We expect HAPTEX to investigate how far it is possible to provide a user with a completely reliable sense of fabric through a virtual experience.

102,51070,Yes,"TY CERIG : SMALL HYDRO INNOVATIONS PARTICULARLY ADAPTED FOR LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WITH ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION","To design, install and monitor a 200 kW hydropower scheme in an environmentally sensitive area in the UK. The scheme aims to demonstrate the technical and cost advantages of a package of innovative technologies for small hydro power (SHP) particularly adapted to the needs of less developed countries (LDC's). These technologies are self cleaning static intake screen, bursting disc for penstock protection, electronic load controller for parallel/ isolated operation and water lubricated slide bearing on the spear valve. The second aim is to demonstrate innovative methods and technologies to minimise the environmental impact of an SHP scheme. It is hoped that this will facilitate development of similar sites throughout Europe, by reducing the potential for conflict between SHP developers and environmental regulators.  The proposed site is Ty Cerig, Rhydymain, Gwynedd, Wales, and lies within the Snowdonia National Park. The main land owner is Forest Entreprise, who are responsible, nationally, for managing UK forests. The proposed scheme is a run of river mini hydro project, to be built on a greenfield site. the catchment is forested, with an area of about 3.17 km². the gross head is 160m, and the design flow is 168.5 l/s. A single-jet Pelton turbine will drive a 6-pole synchronous generator, to generate a maximum power of 200 kW. The turbine will be governed by an analogue, thyristor based electronic load controller (ELC), and grid synchronisation unit, with full protection. A water ballast will enable the turbine to operate in stand-alone as well as grid connected mode. All of the power generated, other than that used to power auxiliary equipment, will be sold to the local electricity utility, via a 300m transmission line. The turbine manifold will incorporate a by-pass spur, fitted with a graphite bursting disk. In the event of large pressure surge, this disk will rupture, relieving the surge before it reaches the rest of the pipeline. The water will pass into the tailrace, bypassing the turbine. This will enable the use of a lower strength, and hence less expensive plastic pipeline, as it does not need to be designed to resist full surge pressures. The length of the pipeline will be about 1500m. There is an existing track close to the site of the intake, down which some of the pipeline could be routed. The intake will be fitted with 1.5m width of 'Aquashear' static, self-cleaning intake screen. Innovative technology : - package of technologies particularly adapted for use in less developed countries : self-cleaning, static, coanda-effect intake screen, capable of handling high silt loads, and requiring no continuous maintenance, high reliability; combination of electronic load controller with grid connection and synchronous generator; use of 'bursting disks' for pipeline surge protection. - technologies and methods to minimise environmental impact : energy audit to choose materials and methods of construction that minimise embodied energy; use of water-lubricated turbine spear valve in place of grease, to prevent water pollution; small, sound-proof power house, built using local materials wherever possible.",1,1
230,44504,Yes,Thin Monocrystalline silicon solar Cells and Modules,"PROJECT OBJECTIVES  The objective is to demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that in a silicon solar cell both maximum cell efficiency and lowest manufacturing costs can be achieved for wafer thicknesses between 100 and 150 Mm. This has benefit in lowering the cost of modules by having simultaneously a high module power and low manufacturing costs due to the use of thin silicon wafers and balance of system costs are also reduced.  TECHNICAL APPROACH  The project starts by modelling solar cell structures to define the ideal combination of wafer thickness, resistivity, minority carrier diffusion length and surface passivation for the highest efficiency. This modelling will be consistent with known parameters achievable from available processing techniques. Having defined the desirable solar cell structure the project is directed at realising these structures. The following sequence will be followed  WP1 Solar Cell Modelling  WP2 Preparation of substrates  WP3 Solar Cell Development  WP4 Module development and testing  Wire sawing will be used to cut the thin wafers and the PERC cell structure will form a basis for the solar cell development.  EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION  The expected outcomes are higher efficiency solar cells than present and a much lower utilisation of silicon around 50% less than that previously used. This should result in technological leadership for the participant companies giving lower production costs superior products and a significantly increased market. The specific targets are to demonstrate laboratory solar cells of 4 cm2 area with efficiencies of >18% and in solar cells made under production conditions >17 % efficiency on a 100cm2, both on wafers thinner than 150 um.",1,1
493,220698,No,Flow and Deformation of Cancer tumours near Yielding,"The aim of this proposal is to understand when, how and why metastatic tumour cells detach from a tumour.   Often, primary tumours do not kill patients, but secondary tumours do. These so-called metastatic tumour cells disassociate from a primary tumour and, ultimately, prove fatal. Currently, we do not understand the fundamentals of the biophysical pathways and mechanisms of the metastasis of cancer, hampering medical intervention. I propose a multidisciplinary approach, combining engineering, chemistry, biophysics and cell biology to identify the mechanical pathways for the creation of metastatic cancer cells.  Biological cells in tissue are very densely packed, which locks them in place relative to their neighbours, a state referred to as jammed. The collective system of cells can become fluidised locally and flow when pushed or deformed. Even greater forces can make the entire tissue fluid-like, referred to as yielding. The crucial open questions are: how does tissue yield, and what universal physics underlies yielding?   I will develop a novel fundamental and predictive description of yielding in jammed living tissue to show:  1. How and when jammed living cells are driven to fluid-like state.  2. How confinement tunes the migration mode of cancer cells.  3. How yielding is related to the structural evolution of detached cells. 4. How critical scaling controls deformation and flow of living cells near yielding.  I will demonstrate that the distance to yielding governs the mechanical response in collective cell motion inside a tumour, and that exploiting critical scaling allows predicting the dynamics of cell detachment near yielding. The outcomes will significantly aid the treatment of cancer in the near future by bridging the gap between chemical and mechanical pathways of cancer metastasis. I have the required multidisciplinary track record. Moreover, preliminary experiments show highly promising results.",0,0
869,214642,No,H3PS – High Power High Scalability Aircraft Hybrid Powertrain,"The H3PS starts in a completely new, challenging and probably never seen before revolution in General Aviation (GA). The main driver behind the H3PS project is to develop a new, greener propulsion system (a parallel hybrid powertrain) to pioneer one of the aviation industry’s solutions in reducing the environmental impact of air travel. The propulsion system to be designed and developed within the project will be suitable for powering four-seat GA aircraft, a market segment which employs today piston-powered engines, where the leading engine manufacturers are providing components whose basic technology, although constantly updated and reliable, is now over 50 years old and, in most cases, still needs leaded fuels to operate. The objective of the project is to put the basis for the development, manufacturing and in-flight test of a parallel hybrid powertrain for General Aviation by the involvement of three European GA market leaders: an aircraft manufacturer (TECNAM), an aircraft engines manufacturer (ROTAX) and an electric motors manufacturer (Rolls-Royce). The H3PS project objective is to fly a GA aircraft with the parallel hybrid powertrain demonstrating the challenging advantages of the configuration but also its high scalability level. “Breakthrough” concept will be achieved by demonstrating the feasibility of a power scalability for up to 11 seats airplanes. The main impact of the project will be related to the introduction of a really marketable solution to bring GA in the hybrid vehicles arena. Hybrid solution is today the most realistic intermediate way to step from gasoline operated powerplants to full electric systems offering the same performances, comparable initial acquisition costs and weights but featuring a more-than-acceptable cost saving in operations.  The H3PS project will contribute to the main EU challenges in transportation sector, particularly leadership position of its aeronautics industry and reliable and sustainable air transport system.",0,0
808,60438,No,LOw Cost CATastrophic Event Capturing,"Effective search & rescue operations are amongst the most promising means to reduce human casualties following collapse of buildings due to catastrophic events. Time is critical for a successful rescue and the prompt availability of reliable information is vital. LOCCATEC could enhance significantly the effectiveness of the rescue management and operations, providing a quick survey tool to detect and locate trapped people. It is based on small, low-cost capturing devices to be pre-installed in buildings. Each capturing device, triggered by the event, records what happened in a given space during an eventual collapse. This information is downloaded wirelessly to central units providing the rescuers with a rapid estimate as to the number of people present in each building space at the moment of the event, the structural state of ruins and eventual possible pathways.  Objectives: 1. Development of a prototype system, which would provide the rescue teams quickly and cost-effectively reliable information on: a.The presence (or not) of people in each building space during a collapse; b.The state of the ruins (possible pathways, structural integrity).The LOCCATEC prototype will be a fully functional pre-industrial prototype, including at least one central unit and a number of capturing devices, the functionality of which will be tested against the specified requirements; 2. Significant enhancement of the effectiveness of the rescue management and operations by providing a tool to perform a quick survey of the disaster site to detect and locate trapped people and plan the subsequent rescue operations in the quickest and most effective way. As part of an overall emergency response system, it would allow personnel, equipment and information to be dispatched where it is most needed and assist in setting rescue priorities and planning the rescue effort quickly and efficiently.  Work description: LOCCATEC will be a prototype system aiming at promptly providing the rescuers with information on trapped people and the state of the ruins. It will be based on small, low-cost, autonomous capturing devices to be pre-installed in each building space. Each capturing device, adequately integrated and packaged so as to survive an eventual building collapse, triggered by the catastrophic event (e.g. earthquake), would record what happened in a given space just during the collapse. The rescue team, equipped with the LOCCATEC central unit, upon arriving at the vicinity of the collapsed building, would transmit a signal triggering the wireless download of the information stored in each capturing device. Image processing techniques could yield an estimate as to the number of people present in each space at the moment of the event. The rescue team would have a quick indication on the number of people trapped in each space and some information on the structural state and the possible pathways in the ruin.  Each capturing device will comprise: Optical sensor, FIFO non-volatile memory chip, IR illuminating LED, triggering device, wireless low-power communications and suitable back-up battery. Each central unit will comprise: Communication and localisation equipment to trigger, identify, download the captured information and locate the capturing devices as well as display and image processing capabilities. The LOCCATEC system will be open and flexible with various sensor and triggering options, according to the space and the environment. It can eventually serve as platform for other sensors, like a microphone, which would be activated by the signal that triggers the transmission of the capturing data and would provide the rescue teams with real-time acoustic information.  Milestones: 1) Requirements and specifications; 2) Design; 3) Implementation; 4) Integration; 5) Testing.",0,0
172,222888,Yes,"New Chemical Synthetic Methods for Reacting Phenols Selectively with Different Molecules and With Itself: Use of Electricity as a Sustainable, Economic and Traceless Reagent.","Inventing new green and inexpensive synthetic methods for relevant chemical compounds is one of the ways how organic chemist can contribute to the well-being of humans and Earth.  One of the most promising chemical method for this is synthetic organic electrochemistry. It can replace chemical reducing agents and oxidizers with sole cheap electrons or electron-holes and, at the same time, reduce both the amount of waste and the expense of chemical synthesis. Syntheses are easily controllable as they can be ‘switched-off’ and they are implementable on a large industrial scale with ease. Interestingly, organic electrosynthesis can be used to stabilize electrical grids as fluctuating electric currents are tolerated in certain reactions.   The aim of this project is to develop new sustainable, selective and economic electro-organic synthetic methods for the functionalization of phenols. Particularly, we will concentrate on our efforts for finding new ways to form C-heteroatom bonds between phenols and different substrates. At first, we will study the conversion of phenols to diarylethers and dibenzofurans that are important building blocks and core structures of natural products and biologically active substances. Later, we will try to extend the reactivity for phenol-analogues as wll. On the next step, we will study the cross-coupling between phenols and benzoxazoles and its analogues. In this way, we also obtain important synthetic intermediates for organic chemistry in a sustainable and ecologic manner. The proposed action is divided in two research and three additional work packages.   The project will be implemented at the Institute of Organic Chemistry of Johannes-Gutenberg-University in Mainz in the research group of Professor Siegfried Waldvogel. He has been one of the driving forces of electro-organic synthesis already for 18 years and made seminal contributions during that time. It is therefore the top laboratory worldwide for performing the proposed action.",0,1

With an interface to a conventional digital computer we will use computer controlled manipulation of physical systems to evolve them towards doing useful computation. During the project our target is to lay the technological and theoretical foundations for this new kind of information processing technology, inspired by the success of natural evolution and the advancement of nanotechnology, and the expectation that we soon reach the limits of miniaturisation in digital circuitry (Moore's Law). The mathematical modelling of the configuration of networks of nanoscale particles combined with the embodied realisation of such systems through computer controlled stochastic search can strengthen the theoretical foundations of the field while keeping a strong focus on their potential application in future devices. Members of the consortium have already demonstrated proof of principle by the evolution of liquid crystal computational processors for simple tasks, but these earlier studies have only scraped the surface of what such systems may be capable of achieving. With this project we want to develop alternative approaches for situations or problems that are challenging or impossible to solve with conventional methods and models of computation. Achieving our objectives fully would provide not only a major disruptive technology for the electronics industry but probably the foundations of the next industrial revolution. Overall, we consider that this is to be a highly adventurous, high risk project with an enormous potential impact on society and the quality of life in general, including medicine, everyday household items, energy-saving policies, security, and communication.",0,0

Factors influencing recruitment, retention and gender equity in science, technology and mathematics higher education","IRIS (Interest & Recruitment in Science) addresses the challenge that few young people (women in particular) choose education and career in science, technology and mathematics (STM). Women represent the greatest recruitment potential to STM; moreover, a higher participation from women may expand the ways of thinking and working within this area and contribute to gender equity.  To understand and respond to this challenge, diverse causes and cures must be sought, ranging from school experiences and youth culture via higher education STM curricula and recruitment efforts, up to research department culture, PhD choice and employment patterns.   IRIS aims to contribute to understanding and improving recruitment, retention and gender equity patterns in higher STM education.  1. On what priorities, values and experiences do young people base their educational choice?  - How may youth's educational choice be interpreted through sociological perspectives on late modern societies? What makes many women turn away from STM? - Which considerations determine choice of PhD research topic for female and male STM students?  2. What are the success factors for efforts aimed at recruiting more (female) students to STM?  - What features of STM education, in secondary school and at university level, influence recruitment of (female) students?  - What are the effects of STM recruitment initiatives? 3. In what proportions, and for what reasons, do STM students opt out of STM education?  - Are there differences in opt-out-rates between countries, institutions and genders?  The main instrument will be a questionnaire to be completed by first-year students. All partners will contribute to instrument development, data collection and analysis, each with a specific focus. Questionnaire data will be complemented by literature reviews and smaller quantitative and qualitative studies.

502,100709,No,Correct and Efficient Accelerator Programming,"In recent years, massively parallel accelerator processors, primarily GPUs, have become widely available to end-users. Accelerators offer tremendous compute power at a low cost, and tasks such as media processing, simulation, medical imaging and eye-tracking can be accelerated to beat CPU performance by orders of magnitude. Performance is gained in energy efficiency and execution speed, allowing intensive media processing software to run in low-power consumer devices.  Accelerators present a serious challenge for software developers. A system may contain one or more of the plethora of accelerators on the market, with many more products anticipated in the immediate future. Applications must exhibit portable correctness, operating correctly on any configuration of accelerators, and portable performance, exploiting processing power and energy efficiency offered by a wide range of devices.  The aim of CARP is to design techniques and tools for correct and efficient accelerator programming:– Novel & attractive methods for constructing system-independent accelerator programs – Advanced code generation techniques to produce highly optimised system-specific code from system-independent programs– Scalable static techniques for analysing system-independent and system-specific accelerator programs both qualitatively and quantitatively CARP will integrate these methods, providing a unified accelerator development flow. This will: Reduce the cost of accelerator programming and time-to-market quotas– Increase energy efficiency of accelerated software, conserving battery life in mobile devices– Increase confidence in the reliability of accelerated software.  The CARP consortium is composed of leading European research experts and prominent tool providers. CARP will be validated at: – Realeyes OÜ, Estonia, developers of eye-tracking solutions– Rightware Oy, Finland, developers of benchmarks for mobile devices– ARM Ltd, UK, designers of the Mali GPU and associated tools.",0,0
726,94063,No,Mechanisms of microRNA biogenesis and turnover,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of genes, accounting for &gt;1% of genes in a typical animal genome. They constitute an important layer of gene regulation that affects diverse processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Despite such critical roles, deciphering the mechanism of action of miRNAs has been difficult, leading to multiple, partially contradictory, models of miRNA activity. Moreover, adding an additional layer of complexity, it is now emerging that miRNA activity is regulated by various mechanisms that we are only beginning to identify. Our objective is to understand how miRNAs are regulated under physiological conditions, in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. We will focus on pathways of miRNA turnover, an issue of fundamental importance that has received little attention because miRNAs are widely held to be highly stable molecules. However, miRNA over-accumulation causes aberrant development and disease, prompting us to test rigorously whether degradation can antagonize miRNA activity and either identify the machinery involved, or confirm the dominance of other regulatory modalities, whose components we will identify. C. elegans is the organism in which miRNAs and many components of the miRNA machinery were discovered. However, previous studies emphasized genetics and cell biology approaches, limiting the degree of mechanistic insight that could be obtained. In addition to exploiting the traditional strengths of C. elegans, we will therefore develop and apply biochemical and genomic techniques to obtain a comprehensive understanding of miRNA regulation, enabling us to demonstrate both molecular mechanisms and physiological relevance. Given the importance of miRNAs in development and disease, identifying the regulators of these tiny gene regulators will be both of scientific interest and biomedical relevance.",0,0
375,74816,No,Disposable Dot Field Effect Transistor for High Speed Si Integrated Circuits,"The goal of the proposed research is the evaluation of an entirely new path to fabricate strained Si nano-devices that are compatible to Si CMOS processing. The idea is to fabricate field effect transistors from strained Si bridges, which have been manufactured by disposing embedded, sacrificial Ge islands (dots). To achieve the required positioning of the Ge dots, templated self-assembling will be explored. This approach promises high speed electronics, due to the large mobility of carriers in strained Si, substantially reduced short channel effects, since the thickness of the channel is defined by an air bridge, and an improved thermal conductivity, which is attributed to the all Si device design.  Alternative paths for the templated self assembly of Ge dots will be investigated, including e-beam lithography and x-ray interference lithography for the pre-pattern and molecular beam epitaxy as well as chemical vapour deposition for the growth of the ordered Ge islands. Care will be taken to analyse by grazing incidence x-ray diffractometry the strain and its uniformity in the Si bridges before and after removal of the Ge dots as well as after the fabrication of the gate stack.  The actual devices will be processed using CMOS compatible Si device technology. The fabrication of the devices will be accompanied by intensive structural and electronic modelling. Special emphasis will be put on the strain distribution in the Si channel prior and after the removal of the dots and its impact on the electronic properties of the devices.  To tackle these complex multi-faceted project, experts in the field of crystal growth, structural and electronic analysis, device processing, modelling of crystal growth and device simulation will closely cooperate. As a result detailed insights into the correlation between structural and electronic properties in Si nano-electronic devices are expected as well as the successful fabrication of this new device - the disposable dot FET.",0,0
536,197274,No,European Standardised Process Approach to Cognitive Evaluation in older people,"During this fellowship at Dublin City University (Ireland), the researcher will enhance, significantly, the clinical utility of existing traditionally used cognitive tests, particularly as it relates to the early detection and accurate diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Cognitive difficulties represent the hallmark of many neurodegenerative conditions and, in relation to dementia, cognitive evaluation represents one major pillar of current methods of detection and diagnosis. There are, however, many difficulties with existing cognitive tests and this project has been designed to address this issue. The need for and the potential benefits of early and accurate detection of MCI and dementia is well-recognised. Early and accurate detection is, however, complex and, at present, is subject to high diagnostic error rates. With the expected advent of new effective drug treatments for different neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease), early and accurate diagnosis will be even more vital into the future. Using the principles of what is known as the Qualitative Process Approach (QPA), the goal of this project is to identify and develop a battery of cognitive tests, both in traditional paper-and-pencil form and, when clinically appropriate, in a computerised version, with the aim of enabling a wide range of clinicians improve early and accurate diagnosis. This fellowship will play a crucial role in the career of Dr. Unai Diaz Orueta by providing him with international research experience and making him a reference expert in international neuropsychological research. Patients, families and society will benefit for earlier detection, earlier intervention, and reduced healthcare costs, as the improvement in the accuracy of the diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions will subsequently impact in planning appropriate early interventions and saving millions of Euros associated to both formal and informal care of older people with dementia.",0,0
350,200400,No,Developing Structure-Reactivity Relationships of the Zeolite Catalysed Bio-alcohol Mediated Aromatic Alkylation Processes via a Multi-Spectroscopic Investigative Approach,"A top priority of the European Union under the Horizon 2020 protocol is that chemical industries must reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. In the petro-chemical industry, aromatic alkylation processes using olefins as alkylating agents and zeolites or inorganic Lewis acids as catalysts are still exclusively depending on fossil fuels. Other limitations of these processes include corrosion, toxicity, contamination and undesired side reactions. Hence, I will develop new zeolite-based catalytic technologies for the alkylation of aromatics using bio-alcohols (derived from biomass) as alkylating agents. Here I hypothesize that MWW type medium pore zeolites and MTW/MOR type large pore zeolites are ideal catalysts for aromatic alkylation using short and long chain alcohols, respectively. In this regard, the specific project aims are: (1) evaluation of these specific medium and large pore zeolites for the production of alkylated aromatics with high selectivity and purity in bio-alcohol mediated aromatic alkylation processes, (2) proper process optimization by tuning all reaction parameters in order to achieve excellent selectivity at reasonably higher reactivity and (3) elucidation of the catalytic cycle and deactivation mechanism and establishment of the structure-property-function relationships through the application of advanced in situ/operando (micro-)spectroscopic techniques. Altogether, the acquired knowledge from this research project will help the chemical community to design future catalyst materials for bio-alcohol mediated aromatic alkylation processes.     This project will be carried out within Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis (ICC) group at Utrecht University under the supervision of Prof. Bert M. Weckhuysen. This will allow me to develop my knowledge and skills in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis and in situ spectroscopy in order to steer my future as an independent researcher in the direction of heterogeneous catalysis for organic syntheses.",0,0

This robotic platform is innovative in the wind market due to its performance in connection to two preventive maintenance operations which are currently carried out manually, thus resulting in the corresponding cost, efficiency and hazard issues associated to them: •Cleaning service: the platform carries a water cannon with two degrees of freedom capable of injecting both hot water and soap at high pressure all over the surface of the tower, blades and nacelle, thus performing the cleaning tasks. •Inspection service: the robotic platform is capable of carrying adjustable high resolution cameras, and thermographic cameras, thereby collecting data, generating graphic reports, images, and high resolution videos. In the management and maintenance of towers, it is essential and really useful to conduct a close-range and detailed control of blades, which will allow for fast and concrete repairs to be carried out, thereby immediately increasing performance and preventing more significant damages. Nowadays, the aforementioned two actions are carried out manually in wind towers and, consequently, they are too expensive, not efficient enough, and dangerous, thus deriving in a potential performance reduction. Therefore, with the prototype developed, it is possible to achieve a potential increase in the energy efficiency of wind turbines as a result of lower costs, higher efficiency and a reduction of the hazards associated to the service by means of the EeC WITUR device. The current similar robotic solutions (mostly from the USA) are exclusively aimed at inspection services.",0,0

The industry is growing at a cumulative rate of over 40% per annum, even with effects of the financial crisis. However, to contribute to global power this century, growth of around 100% pa is required. The challenge facing the photovoltaic industry is cost effectiveness through much lower embodied energy. Plastic electronics and solution-processable inorganic semiconductors can revolutionise this industry due to their relatively easy and low cost processability (low embodied energy). The efficiency of solar cells fabricated from these “cheap” materials, is approaching competitive values, with comparison tests showing better performance for sensitizer activated solar cells with reference to amorphous silicon and CIS in Northern European conditions. A 50% increase of the output will make these new solar cells commercially dominant in all markets since they are superior in capturing photons in non-ideal conditions (angled sun, cloud, haze) having a stable maximum power point over the full range of light intensity. To enable this jump in performance in a timely manner, a paradigm shift is required. The revolutionary approach to these solar cells we are undertaking in the SANS project is exactly that and matches the desires of the IEA for mitigation of climate change. Our objectives are to create: highly efficient panchromatic sensitizers, ideally structured semiconducting metal oxide materials and composites; optimized non-volatile and quasi solid-state electrolyte compositions and solid-state organic hole-transporters; achieve full comprehension of the physical processes occurring during solar cell operation; and realization of a 40,000 hrs out door lifetime, being the springboard for commercialization.",1,1

The testing is a major activity in every project therefore it is our intention to experiment as a parallel activity to the current development, the use of a more modern approach whose main objective is the automated execution of the tests.  The experiment will address two specific aspects of testing: the phase devoted to the integration of several modules into a subsystem (Integration Test) and the testing of Man Machine Interface.  As automation requires a strong use of formalism in the description of all the testing process, the impact of the technique on the entirety of the SW life cycle as well as its suitability for the adopted life cycle model shall be evaluated.  It is worth to note that our organisation has carefully selected the experiment which in our opinion fully satisfies the ESSI objective and is ready to start with its development.

1060,111258,No,Real-Time In Situ Monitoring of Tool Wear in Precision Engineering Applications,"In precision engineering, the degradation of the cutting surface (tool wear) has the greatest affect on accuracy and surface finish of machined parts. Tool wear is the greatest single contributor to scrap (waste material). In the surgical products market, cosmetic finish requirements (16RA) placed on the precision engineered parts continue to be raised to new levels. Similarly, in the aerospace industry parts need to be increasingly accurate in order to increase energy efficiency. Through the development of CNC technology tolerances of 1µm are now possible. However, SMEs see significant failures in the current technology. Currently, errors associated with tool wear remain uncompensated for and are usually only detected at the end of the machine cycle, by which time the product is scrap. If such monitoring were available, machining parameters could be adjusted to compensate for tool wear, tools could be replaced earlier, machines could be scheduled for down-time and surface finish and dimensional stability would be increased. Such advances would have a strong impact on the efficiency of processes and increase competitive advantage.

628,215252,No,Reversible causally-consistent debugging of concurrent programs,"Modern computing devices execute complex software to provide every-day services and applications. The development of such software is challenging, time consuming and costly. It involves writing a program code, testing it and debugging it, namely finding an error in the code and correcting it. It is estimated that debugging costs an estimated 312 billion USD a year. The most successful commercial debugging tools are reversible debuggers. They allow the users to undo an execution of a faulty program, to find and correct errors, and then to run the corrected code forwards again. UndoDB by Undo Software is the top reversible debugger currently on the market. However, even the best reversible debuggers are not suited very well to debugging of concurrent programs. Moreover, it is not universally agreed yet how to reverse the code of concurrent or distributed software. This project aims at addressing these shortcomings by exploiting the promising notion of causally-consistent reversibility as the basis for reversible debugging tools. Novel formal models and new techniques for recording, analysis and replay of concurrent programs will be created. An execution engine for the shared-memory and message-passing styles of programs will be developed in a close collaboration with Undo Software and Erlang Solutions, the leading software companies. The scientific outcomes will be turned into an experimental prototype software, called Reversible CAusally-consistent DEbugger (RCADE), which will extend and enhance commercial debugging tools, especially for concurrency.

In spite of EU policies to reach the goal of 32% renewable energy by 2030 and to promote the standards of nearly Zero Energy Buildings, solar energy is not massively installed as expected in building sector. Potential is huge: more than 75% of building stock is inefficient and need refurbishment actions. However, solar thermal heat (for sanitary water and space heating mainly) and solar photovoltaic electricity compete for space in rooftop. Abora Solar is a company specialized in designing, developing and manufacturing hybrid solar collectors, which simultaneously provide heat and electricity. Our goal is to bring to the market the most profitable solar collector: this is SHE. We are sales’ leader in Spain with nearly 2,000 hybrid solar panels installed. However, present technology’s limitations of hybrid solar panels do not allow to reach high temperatures as solar thermal collectors and costs are too high to fulfil the willingness to pay from most of the customers: 5 years payback. We have patented a breakthrough innovation that completely changes the structure and manufacturing process of hybrid solar panels, allowing us to simultaneously increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. With SHE collector we can provide 5 year payback and supply 5 times more energy than a photovoltaic panel. We face the market of solar heat in buildings and industries, valued in € 195 billion in 2025 with nearly 450 million solar collectors installed, which additionally always requires electricity for other uses. Abora Solar ask for EIC Accelerator Pilot grant to finalise the development of our solar panel and the manufacturing line to accelerate the market launch in 2021.

The Mediterranean region has large potential for the use of renewable energies particularly solar energy due to its high level of solar radiation. Only a small variety of solar thermal technologies, first of all solar water heaters, is used in the region.  The MPC have begun to actively support the dissemination of simple solar thermal systems in order to develop alternative ways to meet the challenges of energy supply besides conventional energy resources. But still not only the dissemination of solar thermal technologies but also the state of technology vary considerably across the MPC and in relation to EU countries. A closer cooperation between research institutions and energy agencies from the Mediterranean Partner Countries and the EU is needed in order to promote a new generation of solar thermal and cooling systems in the MPC. SOLATERM works with 18 partners from 8 MPC and 8 EU countries covering R&D, policy and promotion aspects of renewable energies in their daily work. SOLATERM aims at the widespread application of a new generation of solar thermal and cooling systems in the MPC.  The project approach can be summarised in three specific objectives: - To transfer technological know-how on solar thermal and cooling systems to the MPC and adapt new technologies to the specific needs of MPC - To broaden the spectrum of solar thermal and cooling applications in the MPC through the promotion of cost-effective solutions e.g. combi-systems - To support the R&D and application of solar thermal and cooling systems in the MPC with political measures",1,1

Such a vehicle will not only reactively cope with dangerous situations, it will also be in the position to predict such situation and thus prevent accidents. These possibilities are limited in today's power trains, e.g. because of lack of a x-by-wire steering and lack of failure tolerant system architecture. A secure failure tolerant power train system has not been considered yet in any automobile accident prevention system. To achieve the necessary requirement, an intelligent automatic control of the vehicle kinematics and safety features is needed. A fully electronically power train provides the technological basis.  Objectives: The objectives of PEIT project are to set up new technologies for power trains in order to create a nearly collision free vehicle. Such a vehicle's power train will not only reactively cope with dangerous situations it will also be able to predict such a situation and thus prevent an accident.

More specific objectives include:- nearly accident free vehicles by providing an intelligent power train- failure tolerant system Architecture- electronic stabilisation programs (ESP) with additional steering control- predictive collision avoidance, lane departure, speed limitations- early detection of defects (predictive diagnosis)- building of a demonstration vehicle.  Work description: To realize these technologies a vehicle base will be set up that enables a pure electronic control of the vehicle's kinematics and thus the vehicle's power train.  The technical and work is carried out in the following work packages: - Definition of a failure-tolerant system architecture (work package 2); - Development of the following individual chassis subsystems for the demonstration of the PEIT functions (work package 3): - Intelligent power train architecture; - Electronic stabilisation program (ESP) with additional steering control to improve the vehicle dynamics; - Brake-by-wire system with a 2-electronic-circuit architecture; - Fail-safe intelligent energy management system for the electric energy supply; - Intelligent tyre yielding information on the friction coefficient for braking capability; - Integration of the subsystems into the vehicle base (work package 4); - Demonstration and evaluation of the demonstrator vehicle (workpackage 5).

Similarly, nucleic acid-functionalized QDs will be used to develop new versatile sensing platforms exhibiting multiplexed analysis capabilities.  One platform will include the quenching of the QDs by G-quadruplexes, whereas the second platform will use biochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) as readout signal.  Also, QDs-modified supramolecular DNA nanostructures will be designed to perform programmed machinery functions such as 'bi-pedal walker', 'seesaw', 'gear' or 'tweezers', and the machinery functions will be transduced by the optical properties of the QDs.

The currently tabulated values are often of unknown quality, contradictory and devoid of essential information, such as Reynolds number and installation effect dependencies. The net result is that designers of ventilation systems for commercial, residential and industrial building, mines, etc. have to incorporate large factors of safety to ensure their systems work. This in turn leads to not only larger than necessary system components but, more importantly in the long term, higher running costs since the system may be operating under far from optimum conditions. A project has therefore been undertaken to produce new traceable mechanical energy loss data for ducting components.   RESULTS   A procedure for the determination of energy loss coefficients was developed and tested via an intercomparison involving 4 laboratories. For values in the range 0.31 to 0.72 the laboratories agreed to within one standard deviation of 2 to 7%. Further improvements were then made to the procedure and the energy loss coefficients for the entire range of circular ducts configurations used by industry were determined for normal span flow rates (Reynolds numbers) encountered in practice.   Using the approximately 1100 combinations a data base has been produced in both written and micro-computer based form. This will be available to the industry at the end of 1992.",0,0
153,107967,Yes,High-capacity hydrogen-based green-energy storage solutions for grid balancing,"INGRID introduces and demonstrates the usage of safe, high-density solid-state hydrogen storage systems as an effective energy vector to balance the grid also by powering off-grid applications, thus enabling a smart balance between variable green energy sources supply and the grid demand.

695,34534,No,Concurrent engineering approach for durability optimisation of trucks applying an integrated fatigue & dynamics methodology oncurrent engineering approach for durability optimisation of trucks applying an integrated fat(igue & dy)namics met,"Durability optimisation is an essential, but costly and  time consuming part of the design and refinement process  of trucks. Competitiveness requirements imposing shorter  design cycles put forward the need for a more effective  and reliable approach to the durability optimisation that  makes optimal use of previous experience and similar  designs. This is particularly critical for the truck  industry because many variants are required to satisfy  widely varying market demands.   The main objective of the project is to develop  integrated design tools for durability assessment and  optimisation of trucks, which combine numerical  prediction methods with tests on physical prototypes on  laboratory test rigs and on test tracks in a closely co  ordinated manner.   First, a fatigue strength information system will be  developed that allows to take maximum advantage of a  company's internal durability experience on previous  similar designs. Second. structural modelling techniques  will be developed that allow in the design phase of a  truck to efficiently optimise a component for durability,  without the need for complete recalculation of the  structural model of the truck. Third, tools will be  developed to generate improved, customer oriented but  time reduced loading environments for use in both  numerical predictions and accelerated fatigue testing on  test tracks and test rigs. Finally, tools to improve  quality and effficiency of test rig fatigue testing will  be implemented.   Overall, these elements will be tightly linked and  integrated in order to obtain an efficient concurrent,  CAE/CAT driven design process for durability  optimisation. As structural dynamics (vibrational  behaviour) has an important impact on the fatigue  performance of trucks, a combined fat(igue & d)ynamics  methodology will be implemented in all steps of the  concurrent engineering approach.   The participation of two truck manufacturers (DAF and  RVI) ensures the development of industrially relevant  solutions. For the validation of the different  technologies, extensive endurance testing on test tracks  and test rigs has been planned by both end users. The two  technology and software development SME's (LMS project  coordinator, and TecMath) have a leading position in  their own field of expertise (structural dynamics LMS  and fatigue analysis TecMath), but need to co operate  in order to develop an integrated system for durability  optimisation The expertise of the University of Leuven is  required for a successful solution to the critical  structural modelling problem.   The direct outcome of the project is an integrated  software system for durability optimisation, and will be  commercialised by LMS and TecMath together. Combining  LMS' market position in the world and TecMath's fatigue  expertise, allows to compete against US companies  currently dominating the durability engineering market.   The most important benefit for the truck manufacturers is  the reduction of the most critical path in the  development time of trucks, which is the durability  optimisation. Subsequently, the truck manufacturers will  be able to increase market share by faster adapting their  products to the fast changing market requirements while  maintaining the reliability.",0,0

981,211410,No,Direct Pathway Cloning of Neglected Bacteria in the Hunt for Novel (Bio-)Chemistry,"To overcome recent global health threats, such as antibiotic resistance, a resurgence in the discovery of new chemical and thus biomedical diversity from microbial sources is needed. Genome mining in combination with heterologous expression is an approach that will overcome these challenges. It involves incorporation of yet uncharacterized natural product genetic loci into a fast growing heterologous host. For this approach, a prolific source of novel natural product gene clusters is vital. Our collaboration with the Zentralinstitut für Ernährungs- und Lebensmittelforschung (ZIEL, Technische Universität München) provides direct access to bacterial isolates completely unexplored in regards to their potential for natural product biosynthesis. Our genome analyses have revealed that many of the ZIEL isolates harbor a large number of uncharacterized natural product gene clusters. Thus, the aim of this proposal is to heterologously express natural product gene clusters from these neglected bacteria to discover novel natural product (bio-)chemistry. Because these organisms are poorly studied, the likelihood of discovering rare or novel biochemistry is immensely increased. Here, we will utilise a novel combination of synthetic biology techniques referred to as Direct Pathway Cloning. This will enable expression vectors to be constructed by large-amplicon PCR (up to 20kb) coupled to Gibson assembly. Development of the methodology is set to revolutionise synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Downstream outcomes of this proposal will be the identification of novel, potentially bioactive natural products, the characterisation of unusual biochemistry and the addition of enzymes to the ‘biocatalytic toolkit’ for natural product synthesis and structural alteration.",0,0
859,79285,No,The role of neuronal compartmentalization in generating specific behavioural responses in C. elegans,"A fundamental question in neurobiology is how specific behaviours are controlled at the level of molecules, cells, and neuralcircuits. In this proposal I aim to investigate how different synapses within the same neuron are specialized, how thisspecializati on contributes to, information processing in the neuron and, ultimately, to specific behavioural responses. Toinvestigate this problem I will study feeding behaviour in the nematode C. elegans. Different wild strains of C. elegans exhibitdifferent feeding strategies, which can be causally linked to the specific action of receptors, sensory neurons, andinterneurons. I will combine genome-wide RNAi screening with forward genetic approaches to identify new molecules thatcontrol how C. elegans respond to food. The function of these genes will be tested using 1. Behavioural assays, 2. Newlydeveloped labels for different post-synaptic elements in the same interneuron, and 3. Genetically encoded indicators of neuralactivity. Ultimately, I hope to understand how inf ormation received at distinct post-synaptic elements from different pre-synaptic partners sculpts neuronal output and behavioural response.",0,0
909,6611,No,DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH QUALITY LINEAR LOW DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AND OPTIMISED PROCESSING FOR FILM BLOWING,"A trans-national collaboration has been initiated between experts in complementary activities. It has been possible to tailor a new resin which exhibits enhanced processing properties in their context of film blowing. In depth analysis performed on the rheology, molecular structure and end-use properties have allowed to identify the best combination of molecular weight, distribution and branching.   Further, a blown film extrusion line has been optimised in order to achieve challenging objectives. Important parts have been reviewed and optimised. New design has been suggested for the screw, the spiral mandrel die; tooling has followed. Also, other components of the extrusion line have been improved in order to achieve the objectives: the bubble cooling system has been improved while a winder with a higher take-up speed is used.   The analysis and optimisation of the flow in a complex extrusion line is a challenge in itself. Complex 3-D geometries have required the development of a new solver with improved computational performances. Calculation speed-up have been obtained, making it feasible to simulate realistic and complex industrial flow situations. Linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is a thermoplastic material made in low pressure, low temperature reactors using ethylene and selected amounts of one or more alkene monomers. Despite intrinsic qualities, the production of LLDPE resins is limited by processing difficulties such as higher sensitivity to surface defects, higher machine power requirement, lower bubble stability and lower melt strength.  The objective of the project is threefold  - develop a new LLDPE resin overcoming the above limitations  - develop a new flexible blown film tailored to the new generation of LLDPE resins  - develop an efficient 3D Finite Element (FEM) Simulation code to assist in the resin and blown film development.  These goals will be achieved through cooperation between a resin manufacturer, a machine manufacturer, a resin transformer, a software company and two university research groups specialized in rheology and processing.",0,0
921,200336,No,Development of a mobile device for the quick on-site measurement of soil nutrients,"Today the application of fertilisers to agricultural crops is mainly based on calculations, estimations and recommendations and not on analyses of the actual demand of soil and plants. The resulting over-fertilisation has substantial disadvantages: pollutions of the groundwater, the eutrophication of surface water bodies, emissions of greenhouse gas from the soil, the depletion of finite natural resources, reduced yields and unnecessary expenses for fertilisers. It is estimated that up to 35 % of the applied fertiliser could be saved if a method for the quick and simple determination of the fertiliser demand existed. Pessl GmbH, an Austrian SME specialised in the development of innovative products in the field of precision farming, has developed a lab-on-a-chip sensor for the quick on-site determination of the concentrations of the most important plant nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate and potassium) in the soil. This sensor will enable farmers to determine the fertiliser requirements of their fields within just a few minutes and without the need for any special knowledge. Based on the results of the EU project OPTIFERT Pessl has developed a first prototype of the sensor which has demonstrated the proper functioning and the great potentials of the technology. However, improvements and adaptations are required to achieve the market breakthrough. In this proposed project a feasibility study will reveal the technical feasibility of the envisaged improvements and the optimal way of implementation, while a business plan will show the optimal way of commercialisation. Pessl’s new nutrient sensor will help European farmers to save up to 35 % of their applied fertiliser, leading to total annual savings of up to 6 billion € or 500 € per average farmer. At the same time Pessl GmbH will be able to significantly grow in terms of turnover, profit and employees and to further expand its leading position on the European market for precision farming products.",1,0
113,92781,Yes,Development and Demonstration of a Novel Integrated Condition Monitoring System for Wind Turbines,"Wind energy is the most developed of a number of renewable energy technologies, with several thousands of wind turbines already operating or being planned for construction across Europe. Wind turbines can be deployed individually to power a single site or installation, but are most commonly grouped together as wind farms to provide power to the electricity grid. The energy output from wind turbines has increased dramatically over the past thirty years from 50kW to 6MW, while 8-12MW turbines are in the design stage. The greater energy yield achieved means that the number of turbines needed to produce a given amount of energy has been reduced by a significant factor. Over the same period the tower height and rotor diameter of turbines have doubled leading to much more complex construction, maintenance and inspection procedures, particularly when off-shore turbines are concerned. Under normal operation schedules wind turbines have an average annual maintenance expenditure of ~2% of the original turbine investment. However, unpredictable failure of certain wind turbine components (i.e. blades, tower, gearbox, generator, brakes, yaw system, etc.) can lead to substantially higher maintenance costs and reduced availability of turbines. To increase the competitiveness of wind energy in comparison to other power generation technologies, significant and measurable improvements in the availability, reliability and lifetime of wind turbines need to be achieved in the foreseeable future. NIMO seeks to practically eliminate catastrophic failures and minimise the need for corrective maintenance by developing and successfully implementing an integrated condition monitoring system for the continuous evaluation of wind turbines. NIMO will advance existing state-of-the-art condition monitoring technology used in wind turbines by delivering an advanced system which will be able to reliably evaluate the condition of critical structural components, rotating parts and braking mechanis",1,1
74,199494,Yes,H2AD - Innovative and scalable biotechnology using Microbial Fuel Cell and Anaerobic Digestion for the treatment of micro-scale industrial and agriculture effluents to recover energy from waste,"Lindhurst Innovation Engineering (LIE) have developed H2AD - a novel micro-scale technology for the rapid and safe disposal of organic effluent. A hybrid of microbial fuel cells (MFC) and conventional anaerobic digestion (AD), H2AD is based on a patented bioreactor and electrode architecture.  H2AD enables a 10x reduction in the time required to reduce the organic content of waste, and recover the energy via conversion to a hydrogen/methane rich biogas.  Effluent disposal has been identified by LIE as a key restriction on the productivity and profitability of the EU agri-food and drink processing industry (a-FDPI), which is the largest EU manufacturing industry but includes 271,000 micro and small enterprises (µSE). No viable micro-scale technology currently exists for disposal of effluents from µSE, or is able to recover energy from these waste volumes. However, currently at TRL6/7 through extensive testing on cattle slurry, H2AD can also directly address the challenge of waste management in the a-FDPI, recovering some of the 288TWh of potential energy lost in effluent from the EU a-FDPI annually. The overall aim of the Phase 2 project is to undertake the experimental development and field trials required to confirm predicted H2AD performance/payback for new feedstocks, derived from the a-FDPI. LIE seek to prove commercial viability for efficient removal of organic content from key process waste streams; slurry; and post-AD liquors, with biogas utilisation strategies for optimum payback. The project seeks to develop sensing for automated/remote control of system operation and optimised biogas yields through process performance.  Strong collaboration with EU industrial and academic bodies directly open opportunities for the placement of 600 units in the a-FDPI, as well as a further 14,000 applications in primary agriculture and waste management, in line with LIE’s commercial strategy for H2AD to address the €34 billion global market for waste-to-energy equipment.",0,1
664,102197,No,Oncogene-Induced DNA Damage in Cancer,"I recently proposed a model that helps explain the presence of p53 mutations and genomic instability in human cancers (Nature, 2005; Nature 2006; Science 2008). The key features of this model are that oncogenes induce DNA replication stress, which in turn leads to DNA double-strand breaks, genomic instability and p53-induced senescence or apoptosis. This model is relevant for almost all cancer types and explains the spectrum of mutations being reported in thousands of human cancers by the cancer sequencing consortia. In this project, I propose to take the next logical steps that follow from my discovery. Specifically, I propose the following objectives: 1. Elucidate the mechanisms by which oncogenes induce DNA replication stress. Oncogene-induced genomic deletions map within very large actively transcribed genes. Accordingly, I hypothesize that oncogenes and transcription synergistically disrupt pre-replicative complexes resulting in large genomic regions that have a low density of replication initiation events. To test this hypothesis, I propose to introduce by site-directed homologous recombination a transcription termination sequence at the beginning of very large gene and determine whether it remains sensitive to oncogene-induced genomic instability. Genome-wide transcription and DNA replication patterns will also be examined in cells that are sensitive to oncogene-induced DNA replication stress (most somatic cells and cell lines) and cells that are resistant (induced pluripotent stem cells). 2. Identify and characterize genes necessary for proliferation of cells with oncogene-induced DNA replication stress. Using high throughput siRNA screens we will identify genes, whose depletion inhibits proliferation of cells with oncogene-induced DNA replication stress, without affecting normal cells. We will explore the function of these genes using molecular biology, structural biology and genetic approaches. Some promising candidates have already been identified.",0,0
478,218223,No,Exploring the nucleation of large earthquakes: cascading and unpredictable or slowly driven and forecastable,"How do earthquakes begin? Answering this question is essential to understand fault mechanics but also to determine our ability to forecast large earthquakes. Although it is well established that some events are preceded by foreshocks, contrasting views have been proposed on the nucleation of earthquakes. Do these foreshocks belong to a cascade of random failures leading to the mainshock? Are they triggered by an aseismic nucleation phase in which the fault slips slowly before accelerating to a dynamic, catastrophic rupture? Will we ever be able to monitor and predict the slow onset of earthquakes or are we doomed to observe random, unpredictable cascades of events? We are currently missing a robust tool for quantitative estimation of the proportion of seismic versus aseismic slip during the rupture initiation, cluttering our attempts at understanding what physical mechanisms control the relationship between foreshocks and the onset of large earthquakes.  The current explosion of available near-fault ground-motion observations is an unprecedented opportunity to capture the genesis of earthquakes along active faults. I will develop an entirely new method based a novel data assimilation procedure that will produce probabilistic time-dependent slip models assimilating geodetic, seismic and tsunami datasets. While slow and rapid fault processes are usually studied independently, this unified approach will address the relative contribution of seismic and aseismic deformation.  The first step is the development of a novel probabilistic data assimilation method providing reliable uncertainty estimates and combining multiple data types. The second step is a validation of the method and an application to investigate the onset of recent megathrust earthquakes in Chile and Japan. The third step is the extensive, global use of the algorithm to the continuous monitoring of time-dependent slip along active faults providing an automated detector of the nucleation of earthquakes.",0,0
1069,216248,No,Elucidating the causes and consequences of the global pattern of epigenetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Epigenetics continues to fascinate, especially the notion that it blurs the line between “nature and nurture” and could make Lamarckian adaptation via the inheritance of acquired characteristics possible. That this is in principle possible is clear: in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Thale cress), experimentally induced DNA methylation variation can be inherited and affect important traits. The question is whether this is important in nature. Recent studies of A. thaliana have revealed a pattern of correlation between levels of methylation and climate variables that strongly suggests that methylation is important in adaptation. However, somewhat paradoxically, the experiments also showed that much of the variation for this epigenetic trait appears to have a genetic rather than an epigenetic basis. This suggest that epigenetics may indeed be important for adaptation, but as part of a genetic mechanism that is currently not understood. The goal of this project is to determine whether the global pattern of methylation has a genetic or an epigenetic basis, and to use this information to elucidate the ultimate basis for the global pattern of variation: natural selection.",0,0
46,37064,Yes,"Production of hydrogen rich gas by biomass gasification: application to small scale, fuel cell electricity generation in rural areas","Objectives   This is a feasibility study of the coupling of a biomass  gasification process, converting the energy of biomass  directly to hydrogen, with fuel cells for electricity and heat generation. Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) are considered, in small modular units of a few MWe capacity as they represent an industrial reality, readily available in appropriate  commercial size for field operation. The proposed coupling of biomass gasification and fuel cell is characterized by high  energy conversion efficiency and very low environmental  impact: this provides for easy integration into small-to-medium size agricultural concerns. Electricity could be  either sold or consumed internally; heat would be used for  heating or other internal processes.   The activities are directed towards the study of such systems, both technically and in terms of the technical and economic  constraints on siting in the rural context.   Technical Approach   The research study will start from an exchange of information concerning the characteristics and requirements of the various sub-processes (fluidized bed and entrained bed gasification, phosphoric acid fuel cell electricity generation), through  laboratory investigations in well-defined key areas (biomass pretreatment, catalytic conversion, and cleaning of the  gasification product), to conceptual design of the integrated systems and estimation of system investment costs.   Biotec is investigating the most important aspects related to general plant siting and to the biomass pretreatments which are needed to transform the harvested crops into suitable feedstock for gasification plant. University College London and Noell Energy are performing the process design of the fluidised bed system and the entrained flow gasification process  respectively. The Universities of L'Aquila and Strasbourg are operating on the catalytic aspects of the system (residual tar, methane and CO conversion, catalytic combustion of fuel cell anode exhaust to provide heat for the fluidized bed) both at a conceptual level and with laboratory activities.   Expected Achievements and Exploitation   The cost of energy generated from biomass is generally  considered too high with the present technology, mainly due to the investment cost. The application of a PAFC hydrogen module to power generation from biomass is focused on expanding the market potential, thereby drastically reducing unit costs: low environmental impact and easy operation would rapidly make the present system very attractive for small agricultural  industries, thus opening the market to the relatively large  volumes necessary for the reduction of production costs.  All the partners see the programme as a means of implementing EC Common Agricultural Policy with regard to the rational  exploitation of non-food agricultural applications and clean energy production.",1,1

An optimal level of product quality and process efficiency is regarded as a most relevant competitive edge in world-wide competition on the one hand, especially when mission-critical solutions are provided, and as important impact on business issues, i.e. economy, productivity, time to market on the other hand. It is expected that organised, methodical and controlled reuse will further improve productivity and quality.  THE EXPERIMENT  The experiment is designed to show that and to what degree the improvement goals (increase of quality and productivity) can be achieved by reuse supported by organisational measures, method improvements and process optimisation carried out during the experiments. Further to that, to show, that intra- and inter-departmental exchange of reusable assets is efficient. For the experiment, the project organisation and the Siemens-PSE software engineering method SEM are temporarily enhanced with reuse activities, management functions and metrics. After training and motivation of all hierarchical levels involved, an initial set of reusable asset (software and other results of the software engineering process) is brought in (analysed, classified, described, archived).  After analysing the current situation, the experimentation is carried out on the basis of two Baseline Projects dealing with different types of application (a planning tool in Proj.1 and the integration of computer and telephony in Proj.2). Both project teams bring in the results of their projects, and thus enlarge the common reuse library, both projects use assets from this library emerging from the own and the other baseline project.

The main focus concerning t he multi-fuel flexibility lies on different natural gas qualities and LPG, but also on liquid fuels (diesel like heating oil, industrial gas oil IGO and renewables like FAME). The target nominal net electrical output is 2 kWel (stack electrical output ca. 2,5 kW), which is expected to represent the future mainstream high volume mass market for micro-CHPs. An advanced planar, compact SOFC-stack will be developed and combined with an innovative, compact and robust fuel processor, which will be able to process many different fuels without catalytic components, thus enabling the potential for a long lifetime of >30.000h. A simple, highly integrated and reliable system design will result via the integration of advanced peripheral components like the advanced T hermal Partial Oxidation reformer (T-POX), the multi-purpose off-gas burner, the compact heat exchangers, the cool flame vaporizer and the soot trap. Advanced control strategies will assure an optimal integration in an electrical network environment. The o verall efficiency targets are >35% net electrical efficiency and >90 % total CHP efficiency, which will result in 2 tons of annual CO2 reduction per unit (compared to the combination of a condensing boiler and European electricity mix). The SOFC fuel cell technology will be applied because it is less sensitive to impurities and variations in the fuel composition than other fuel cell systems and has a better cost reduction potential than other fuel cell types.

753,51942,No,New means to promote pedestrian traffic in cities,"Problems to be solved Problems related to traffic, congestion, parking, traffic safety, noise and pollution, and to physical, functional and qualitative decay of our urban environment in general, are today particularly acute in European cities. Since the 1950's the trend has been in all European cities to become more and more car-oriented. Car traffic increasingly occupies public spaces of the cities and causes pollution, noise and casualties. This has happened despite many efforts to regulate it in cities. At the same time the share of the non-motorised transport modes is declining all over Europe, although bicycling in some European cities plays an important role. Several European policies bring forward the problems concerning quality of life, equality, parity of access to basic services, social inclusion, regeneration of urban areas, sustainability of the urban environment, pollution, and condition of buildings, public spaces, cultural heritage and the balance of the urban system. The increase of the use of cars in our cities is one significant cause for all these problems. A revival of walking in cities would be a simple and natural way to remedy many of the above-mentioned problems. It would reduce the use of cars and enhance the use of public transport and thus decrease the pollution load. It would also promote the social life in the public spaces and improve the parity of citizens. The promotion of walking would also have many other positive consequences by, for example, improving citizens' physical condition and opening again their eyes to the details and richness of the surrounding nature and physical milieu. However, the problem remains how to effectively promote city walking. Scientific objectives and approach The main goal of PROMPT is to promote walking in cities. Its concrete objective is to develop for that purpose new innovative tools and generic solutions for city actors involved in urban planning and design as well as decision-making. The approach of the project is to consider all the causes enhancing or hindering walking in parallel. The scope ranges from the overall urban structure to the detailed street level. The tools and solutions are aimed at problem identification, design and planning as well as implementation of the considered measures in different local or European wide situations. The project is based on the analysis of certain existing towns in the participating countries and of some relevant case areas in them. The analysis is made according to six different themes: 1) safety, 2) accessibility, 3) comfort, 4) attractiveness, 5) intermodality and 6) implementation. Although one can promote walking by considering each of these issues one by one, it is crucial to consider how they work together: the whole is not the sum of its parts. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is utilised to find good comprehensive solutions for the identified problems. Different user categories, climatic conditions, different situations in the urban structure and cultural values of the site are also taken into account in the analysis. Expected impacts The planners', designers' and decision makers' knowledge about how to promote walking in practice is being considerably improved through the establishment of new tools and solutions and their effective dissemination during and after the project. This, in turn, is expected to increase the share of walking in the future transport bringing along the benefits stated above. The main benefits will be the decrease of harmful impacts on the environment as well as the improvement of the accessibility to the public spaces, the health of the citizens, and their equality regardless of car ownership, health or disability. The increase of walking means also reductions in vehicle and road investments. Further, it means less costs in pollution abatements, less accidents and injuries and less damages in buildings. The impacts are difficult to quantify beforehand, but the project aims also at making some more concrete estimations of them. The main beneficiaries are the citizens themselves as well as the city authorities in many ways.",0,0
856,219475,No,Charging network optimized for Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs),"Due to growing population with growing urbanisation tendency, transportation is a major burden for modern cities. In Europe, using cars (even electric cars) is not the most optimal way of individual travelling in cities, due to busy roads, constant traffic jams, and difficult parking. The spreading of so-called Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) represents one of the best solutions to the current challenges of urban transportation. However, the major obstacle of the spreading of LEVs in European cities is the lack of charging networks, resulting in too short range of the vehicles. Our company, Servo Movement Ltd, aims to commercialise Servo PowerShare, a community electric power sharing system designed for charging light electric vehicles (LEVs) in the streets. In the current project we aim to perform a feasibility study, which is essential for our successful market entrance. The success of this project will facilitate the commercial introduction of PowerShare and promote the growth of our company.",0,0
565,67971,No,Explosive eruption risk and decision support for eu populations threatened by volcanoes,"In the last few decades the population worldwide has become concentrated in age conurbations at high risk from volcanic disasters. The most serious hazards are represented by the occurrence of pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout at European cities on explosive volcanoes and volcanic islands. Whatever the policy to mitigate such a huge risk might be, quantification of risk in association with a range of eruption scenarios, their impact, and mitigation are the fundamental priorities. This project addresses these critical issues by advancing critical scientific and technological facilities (i.e. the infrastructures), needed in volcanic risk assessment and mitigation, such as the computer models to simulate the process dynamics, the vulnerability databases, and the probabilistic risk assessment protocol. The project also aims to apply these facilities to those European volcanoes at high risk Vesuvius, Soufriere, Sete Cidades, Teide) so that they become a technology platform for exploitation at volcanoes throughout the world capable of supporting officials in deciding development and planning priorities as well as decision making in volcanic crises.",0,0
915,44441,No,Presentation of Cryptic Epitopes in Autoimmune Diseases,"Objectives:  Our project aims to analyze the molecular mechanisms of presentation of cryptic epitopes and their participation in the development of autoimmune diseases. Seven European laboratories from five different countries, specialized in biochemical, cell biological, immunological and clinical aspects of antigen presentation and autoimmuniy, will concert their efforts aiming at: l) analyzing the molecular basis for crypticity. We will determine why certain peptides are not normally presented to T.  2) defining the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby cryptic epitopes are efficiently processed and presented to T cells under particular conditions or by certain antigen presenting cells 3) analyzing antigen presentation in autoimmunity and defining the role of cryptic epitopes in autoimmune pathogenesis.  Brief description:  Autoimmune diseases represent one of the most common chronic diseases in European countries. Despite their frequency, and despite an enormous amount of work in many different human pathologies and murine models, the fundamental immunological basis for the onset and the development of autoimmune diseases remain unclear. It is clear, however, that most chronic autoimmune diseases involve pathologic self reactive T lymphocytes. The central question is then why autoreactive T cells, which are norrmally tolerized in the thymus, escape negative selection and then initiate an autoimmune disease. A simple unifying hypothesis has recently been proposed: the epitopes involved in autoimmune pathogenesis are 'cryptic' self epitopes (i.e. epitopes corresponding to peptides which do not induce a T cell response after immunization with intact antigens, but which do trigger normal responses after direct immunization with the peptide) (Lanzavecchia, 1995; Sercarz et al., 1993). These self epitopes do not induce central T cell tolerance because they are not efficiently presented in the thymus. T cells specific for these epitopes are therefore not tolerized and may become pathogenic if the crypitic epitopes are presented in the periphery. Autoimmunity then results from the pathogenic presentation in peripherical tissues of normally hidden, cryptic epitopes. This, of course, does not exclude the possibility that autoimmunity can also result from breakdown of tolerance against dominant self-epitopes. In view of the fact that increasing evidence implicates the presentation of cryptic epitopes in autoimmunity, these studies have as ultimate goal to provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. This project will potentially lead to the identification of pharmaceutical targets and the development of new therapeutic strategies based on the manipulation of antigen processing and presentation in autoimmune diseases.

295,218490,No,ICT Infrastructure for Connected and Automated Road Transport,"ICT4CART, totally aligned with the work programme, is providing an ICT infrastructure to enable the transition towards road transport automation. To meet this high level objective ICT4CART is bringing together, adapting and improving technological advances from different industries, mainly telecom, automotive and IT. It adopts a hybrid communication approach where all the major wireless technologies, i.e. cellular, ITS G5 and LTE-V, are integrated under a flexible “sliced” network architecture. This architecture will ensure performance and resilience for different groups of applications according to the needs of higher levels of automation (L3 & L4). On top of that, a distributed IT environment for data aggregation and analytics will be implemented. This offers seamless integration and exchange of data and services between all the different actors, allowing 3rd parties to develop, deliver and provide innovative services, thus creating new business opportunities. Cyber-security and data privacy aspects will be duly considered throughout the whole ICT infrastructure. In addition, novel accurate localisation services, exploiting the cellular network and information from other sources, such as on-board sensors, especially in complex areas (e.g. urban), will be addressed. Standardisation and interoperability are of high interest within ICT4CART in order to ensure the impact of the project towards enabling the transition to higher levels of automation. In this context issues related to the frequency spectrum will be investigated, while through the organisation of relevant workshops the engagement of policy makers and public authorities is ensured. To achieve its objectives ICT4CART, instead of working in generic solutions with questionable impact, it builds on four specific high-value use cases (urban and highway) which will be demonstrated and validated under real-life conditions at the test sites in Austria, Germany, Italy and across the Italian-Austrian border.",0,0
757,94365,No,"The Initiation of Eukaryotic DNA Replication: Mechanism, Regulation and Role in Genome Stability","In each cell cycle, eukaryotic cells must faithfully replicate large genomes in a relatively short time. This is accomplished by initiating DNA replication from many replication origins distributed along chromosomes. Ensuring that each origin is efficiently activated once and only once per cell cycle is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the genome. Recent evidence indicates that defects in the regulation of origin firing may be important contributors to genome instability in cancer. Strict once per cell cycle DNA replication is achieved by a two-step mechanism. DNA replication origins are first licensed by loading an inactive DNA helicase (Mcm2-7) into pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs). This can only occur during G1 phase. Initiation then occurs during S phase, triggered by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), which promote recruitment of proteins required for helicase activation and replisome assembly. Research proposed herein will lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanism and regulation of DNA replication. We have reconstituted the licensing reaction with purified proteins which will be used to characterise the mechanism of licensing and the mechanism by which licensing is regulated in the cell cycle. We will also use this system to reconstitute events leading to the initiation of DNA replication. We will use genetic and biochemical approaches to characterise the mechanisms by which perturbed licensing causes gross chromosome rearrangements. We will also explore mechanisms involved in regulating the temporal programme of origin firing and how origin firing is regulated in response to DNA damage. Work in budding yeast and mammalian cells will be pursued in parallel to exploit the specific advantages of each system.",0,0
436,103354,No,Delayed Luminescence Spectroscopy of Organic Photovoltaic Systems,"'This project aims to accomplish an understanding of the processes that currently limit the power conversion efficiency of solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, by identifying the factors that are responsible for the losses in device photocurrent generation. In particular, attention will be given to the origin of the photocurrent generation losses in OPV devices that take place due to the recombination of free charge carriers, prior to charge collection at the device electrodes. For the realization of the study a new set of non-fullerene based perfluorinated materials will be used as electron-acceptors and commercially available polymeric matrices such as poly(fluorene)-copolymers and poly(thiophene)s will be used as electron-donors. Free carrier recombination in the fabricated OPV layers and in their devices will be monitored by the detection of delayed luminescence in the μs – ms time scales, as a function of the photoactive layer morphology. The resulting luminescence dynamics will be then correlated to the photocurrent generation efficiency of the corresponding OPV devices and to the charge transport capabilities of the OPV layers. The project aims to deliver a new insight on the nature and the dynamics of charge transfer excited states that survive at delayed times after photoexcitation (delxplexes) in photoactive donor/acceptor composites. Throughout the project the photophysical and electrical characterization of next generation electron-acceptor materials will be realized and this will contribute in the progress of the OPV research field. The significance of the proposed project stems from the high potential of organic semiconductors to produce inexpensive and efficient photovoltaic systems. The project will mutually benefit the applicant and the Host Institution by supporting a smooth exchange of knowledge, by integrating their different expertise on the field of organic semiconductors and by accelerating the applicant's research career.'",0,0
77,212362,Yes,HEAT PIPE TECHNOLOGY FOR THERMAL ENERGY RECOVERY IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS,"Energy-Intensive Industries (EII) in Europe are characterized by very high energy production costs as well as by an important level of CO2 emissions. Energy production costs account for up to 40% of total production costs in some EII, while EII emissions represent a quarter of total EU CO2 emissions. EII are therefore directly concerned by the EU 2014 Energy/Climate Package, which sets a global objective of 40% reduction of GHG emissions and 27% increase of energy efficiency by 2030. The report on energy prices and costs for some energy-intensive sectors published by the European Commission showed for example that natural gas prices for European ceramic companies increased by around 30% between 2010 and 2012 and they were four times higher than in Russia and more than three times higher than in the USA. Similarly, electricity costs were two times higher in the EU than in the USA and Russia. Such figures clearly confirm that energy is a crucial element for the competitiveness of our industry. Therefore, an integrated approach to process innovation is proposed within ETEKINA project covering design, simulation, operating conditions and process management together with breakthrough technology for waste heat recovery. The overall objective of ETEKINA project is to improve the energy performance of industrial processes. For this to be possible, the valorisation of waste heat by a turnkey modular  Heat Pipe Based Heat Exchanger (HPHE)  technology adaptable to different industry sectors will be addressed within the project and demonstrated in three industrial processes from the non-ferrous, steel and ceramic sectors in order to demonstrate: (i) the economic feasibility of the solution, and therefore (ii) its market potential.",1,1

Hormone response pathways involved in the production of prolactin (PRL) and corticotrophin (ACTH) have been studied using in vitro preparations of hypothalamic and pituitary tissues (blocks, slices, primary cultures and tumour cell lines). Ion channels were studied both electrophysiologically and pharmacologically and second messenger responses were assessed in several ways, including the use of in situ hybridisation to measure messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to assess events relating to protein synthesis. A hormone regulated, voltage sensitive calcium channel in lactotrophs was confirmed by direct electrophysiological observation and activation of this channel was shown to entrain increases in the mRNA for PRL. In addition, the activity of the channel was shown to be controlled in a negative sense by a G protein, an effect opposed by the steroid hormone oestradiol. Closer examination of the G protein mechanism showed that it is possible to desynchronise secretory and transcriptional responses to neurotransmitter stimulation in lactotrophs. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone was found to interfere acutely with another G protein dependent event, the late processing of the ACTH molecule. On the other hand, glucocorticoids chronically caused a profound reduction in the mRNA for ACTH. Thus a series of both rapid and delayed intracellular changes are initiated by hormones and neurotransmitters and these may readily be assessed by the application of appropriate techniques.

However, current solar technologies in the market converting light directly to electricity theoretically can harvest only 33% of this energy. Stacking several solar cells with appropriate optical properties, power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be almost doubled. Albeit, current multiple junction (MJ) solar cells are very expensive and unaffordable for large scale applications. Combination of well-established thin film solar technologies is a promising strategy for fabrication of high-efficiency and cost-effective MJ solar cells. Dual junction solar cells combining Si and wide bandgap thin films are extensively studied. Infrared (IR) part of solar spectrum is not utilized by such dual junction. PCE can be boosted up to 49% by adding IR solar cell. However, there are only few materials with suitable bandgap for IR solar cells, and they contain toxic chemical elements and/or are expensive to synthesize. Evidently, there is an urgent need to explore novel materials for IR solar cells which is the main goal of the current Marie Skłodowska-Curie project. Chalcogenide-perovskites (CP) is an emerging class of materials that has been highly regarded for optoelectronic application. However, little experimental evidence of photovoltaic (PV) properties has been demonstrated. This project aims to unravel the potential of CP materials for IR PV.

253,67930,Yes,A high resolution numerical wind energy model for on- and offshore forecasting using ensemble predictions (HONEYMOON),"Objectives and Problems to be solved : With more accurate forecasts of wind power production, network operators will be able to plan more effectively for the integration of wind into the network. An implemented uncertainty estimate of the power predictions in the model system will provide an economic measure of the wind power prediction in a 'bidding' environment. The system developed in this project will try to meet the requirements of the customers and users of the system. The future maintenance of the system has the highest priority in the development, and a major challenge is the portability of the software and its flexibility to available computer resources. A key element in the system will be the flexibility in coupling of specific models of the atmosphere, ocean and surface waves. This coupled model system will increase the quality of on- and offshore wind forecasts. Description of work HONEYMOON's project framework allows plug-and-play of coded modules, which speeds up development, debugging, and testing cycles immensely. We will address how dynamic implementation of code modules rather than static implementation can cut development and test-times down. The new forecast model is based on the structure of the DMI-High Resolution Limited Area Model HIRLAM. The wave model WAM was coupled to and a wind power module implemented into HIRLAM recently. In the project, the ocean model BSH and an ensemble prediction system will become new modules. These together will build a new forecasting system. The HIRLAM model, the wave model WAM and the wind power model HIRPOM will be further adapted to operational wind energy requirements and the coupling strategies improved. The main purpose of the coupling between ocean, wave and atmospheric model is to predict currents in the sea that have impact on sea waves. Both, the tidal and wind forced currents have impact on the sea waves. These affect the sea surface roughness in the atmospheric model and hence wind fields and power prediction. Predictions of waves and currents for maintenance purposes will improve significantly from this coupling. Offshore resource assessments will also benefit from the coupled prediction system, because of the lack of observations. There is no dependency between the modules and the setup will keep the model backward compatible. Any development can thus be easily verified and progress assessed continuously throughout the project. The technical framework has already been developed and tested in semi-operational test mode. The project can therefore fully concentrate on the scientific development, especially the accuracy and portability of the model on- and offshore. Other weather prediction models can be 'plugged in' and used in the model system, which will be demonstrated by using data from other met services. Milestones and expected results Using an operational numerical weather prediction model as a development basis for a real-time wind energy predictions is a sophisticated and yet secure way to meet the challenges of the wind energy forecasting. Such a model makes use of newest modelling methods, provides experience in operational use and maintenance. The new operational model will comprise a NWP model, a wind power, wave, and ocean model, plus ensemble predictions and will be tested at 3 different end-users in the EU.",1,1
124,196223,Yes,Green and Straightforward process for the synthesis of Graphene based-nanomaterials for energy applications,"GRAPHEEN project aims at scaling up a green, affordable and straightforward process for the industrial synthesis of graphene-based materials for their use as new electrode materials in higher performance electrochemical energy storage devices: lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors.   Lithium Ion batteries (LIBs) are currently dominating the energy storage market, as they are to date best performing devices in terms of energy storage capability (energy density). However, LIBs are still facing challenges because they lack of a high power density, meaning these devices have long charging/discharging cycles. This issue is especially important in view of efficiently exploiting renewable energies and especially for supplying the required energy to power electric vehicles (when high energy inputs are required in a very short time). As alternative, supercapacitors emerge as alternative to Lithium Ion batteries because these devices can provide high energy inputs in just a matter of seconds because of their high power density. Nevertheless, in contrast with LIBs, supercapacitors cannot accumulate enough energy to supply during a long time (they have a low energy density). For these reasons, supercapacitors and LIBs are being used as complements one of each other in those highly energy demanding applications. In view of the rapid market entrance of electric vehicles and the big pressure towards using alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, the energy sector is facing an increased need for solutions to enhance the power density of LIBs and to improve the energy density of supercapacitors. The solution to achieve these improvements is the development of new and better performing electrode materials, as the performance of electrochemical devices mostly relies on the properties of the electrodes integrating them.",1,1
456,205990,No,The Collaborative Seismic Earth Model Project,"Seismic tomography images of the Earth's interior are key to the characterisation of earthquakes, natural resource exploration, seismic risk assessment, tsunami warning, and studies of geodynamic processes. While tomography has drawn a fascinating picture of our planet, today's individual researchers can exploit only a fraction of the rapidly expanding seismic data volume. Applications relying on tomographic images lag behind their potential; fundamental questions remain unanswered: Do mantle plumes exist in the deep Earth? What are the properties of active faults, and how do they affect earthquake ground motion?  To address these questions and to ensure continued progress of seismic tomography in the 'Big Data' era, I propose new technological developments that enable a paradigm shift in Earth model construction towards a Collaborative Seismic Earth Model (CSEM). Fully accounting for the physics of wave propagation in the complex 3D Earth, the CSEM is envisioned to evolve successively through a systematic group effort of my team, thus going beyond the tomographic models that individual researchers may construct today.  I will develop the technological foundation of the CSEM and integrate these developments in studies of  large-earthquake rupture processes and the convective pattern of the Earth's mantle in relation to surface geology. The CSEM project will bridge the gap between regional and global tomography, and deliver the first multiscale model of the Earth where crust and mantle are jointly resolved. The CSEM will lead to a dramatic increase in the exploitable seismic data volume, and set new standards for the construction and reproducibility of tomographic Earth models.  Beyond this project, the CSEM will be openly accessible through the European Plate Observing System  (EPOS).

18,40362,Yes,Integrated solar air-conditioning system,"Although the fast development of thermal solar systems in the last years has been limited to the production of heat, their use for production of cold is also technically possible, as has been proved by many large scale installations. This solution is characterized by an noticeable synchronization between offer and demand, especially in south Europe, and by more intense exploitation of solar potential. Research and development of an Integrated Solar Air-conditioning System is proposed, the operation of which will be based on the use of thermal solar energy. Main target of the proposed project is the adaptation and optimization of basic energy technologies (high efficiency solar collectors, adsorption cooling machines, devices for automatic control and optimal energy management), aiming to their introduction in an integrated system, specially designed to operate with solar energy and ready for installation. The proposed work will enable SMEs specialized in the area of solar and cooling technologies, to resolve R&D problems related to the design of this type of system, especially in the range of small and medium capacity conditioning devices.",1,1
62,205589,Yes,Predictive and Accelerated Metabolic Engineering Network,"The world economy is dependent on fossil resources: oil, gas and coal. The fossil resources are finite and their consumption causes catastrophic environmental changes. Therefore we need to move towards sustainable economy using renewable resources for energy and chemicals production. Via metabolic engineering approach, novel microbial cells can be created that can convert biomass and waste into fuels and chemicals. Metabolic engineering however distinguishes itself from other engineering disciplines by low predictability of the design and long turnover times for the cell factory construction and screening. Therefore there is a need for scientists, who can address these challenges. European Training Network on Predictable and Accelerated Metabolic Engineering Networks (PAcMEN) will be established at 5 renowned European universities and 2 SMEs with participation of 5 industrial and 1 academic partner organizations. In this program 16 PhD students (of which 15 funded by EU contribution) will learn to conduct state-of-the-art research on metabolic engineering of microbial cell factories and learn to commercialize innovations. This will be achieved via collaborative research projects under supervision of top scientists from academia and industry, network training, secondments with network partners, training on innovation and entrepreneurship, and individual career coaching. Altogether, PAcMEN training programme will provide young scientists with the ideal combination of scientific, technological, industrial and management skills to prepare them for their role as breakthrough pioneers in the establishment of tomorrow’s biorefineries. The PAcMEN project will have an overall positive impact by strengthening the research networks in the area of metabolic engineering, establishing long-term collaborations between the universities and industry, and by creating a framework for future interdisciplinary training programs.",1,1
841,104906,No,Heterostructure Nanomaterials for Water Splitting,"The aim of this project is to synthesize and assemble novel nanomaterials for the purpose of water splitting through a rational design process. To achieve efficient water splitting we want to mimic photosynthesis in green plants by using the so-called Z-scheme. Briefly, the Z-scheme consists of two photosystems abbreviated as PSI and PSII. When the photosystems are illuminated with light, electrons both in PSI and PSII are excited to a higher level. Due to the specific band offset in these photosystems the photogenerated electrons in PS II are transferred to the highest occupied molecular level of PS I. These electrons then recombine with holes photogenerated at PS I. While the photogenerated electrons in PS I participate in reduction of protons to produce hydrogen, the holes in PSII oxidizes water molecules, producing oxygen. By mimicking such a Z-scheme, we expect the probabilities of charge recombination to decrease significantly, resulting in more efficient hydrogen generation. We want to design novel nanomaterials by modifying a Z-scheme type system with the following changes: 1) to engineer an interface between two different nanomaterials or to link them using a solid state electron mediator, 2) to synthesize a single heterostructure material that meets the band offset requirements, and 3) to selectively deposit metal nanoparticles only on the semiconductor phases designated as PSI. Introducing modifications into a Z-type-scheme will offer the capability of using semiconductors with band gaps less than thermo-dynamical limit (1.23 eV/pH=0) for water splitting and improve photostabilities of many catalysts. The project will primarily aim at boosting the photocatalytic activities of nanomaterials for overall water splitting i.e. attaining a quantum yield above 6.3 % at 420 nm. From the perspective of commercialization, templating systems combined with wet-chemistry synthetic routes will be developed for the preparation of the nanomaterials.",1,0
308,83973,No,Gender awareness participation process: Differences in the choices of science careers,"On the basis of recent studies, it clear that gender differences still exist in science in the EU; it is well known, for example, that girls are statistically less interested than boys in certain branches of science and technology. On a broader level, young people are losing contact with science and the number of science students in universities has decreased.  The GAPP project will act on both levels by establishing an integrated process of qualitative research and developing new practices in science communication and education to reach three well-defined objectives:   1. to understand the loss of interest from young people, particularly girls, in science and technology studies and careers by exploring differences in their perception of S&T professionals, while raising awareness among experts and stakeholders on this issue;   2. to implement social dialogue between the research community, teachers, students, parents and other social actors in order to identify main issues and expectations from these groups ;   3. to develop and test a range of practical activities (didactic activities, labs, stage, etc.) that go in the direction of overcoming gender differences and creating a connection between high school students and the professional worlds of science and technology.   These aims will be achieved through a range of research instruments, participative procedures to deepen discussion and provide the opportunity to develop creative solutions and 'pilot activities' to test the proposed practical solutions. Each phase will provide results that will be useful for themselves and also as a basis for the next step in activities.   The overall process and outcomes will be assessed and published for the diffusion of findings and recommendations to take into account the gender dimension in science education and in career guidance.

834,22540,No,The deployment and testing of a prototype osprey wave energy convertor - PHASE 1,"Wave energy has long been recognised as a major renewable source of power capable of making a major contribution to meeting our energy needs. Europe, and in particular, the Atlantic coastline of the Western European states has one of the most favourable wave climates in the world. To date there has been no significant harnessing of this non polluting power source in that no practical solution has previously been found to the technical and commercial difficulties encountered in extracting wavepower at a price acceptable to the consumer. The OSPREY project seeks to apply a range of innovative concepts to the Oscillating Water Column principle in order to improve energy capture whilst at the same time reducing the cost per installed kilowatt. By achieving these aims the OSPREY offers the potential for large scale commercial wave power.   The specific objectives of the project include: The installation of a prototype OSPREY Oscillating Water Column type wave energy converter at Dounreay in Caithness, Scotland for the purposes of validating, at full scale, energy capture, structural loadings and economic forecasts made on the basis of theoretical and model studies.   The provision of a platform to permit the testing and monitoring of pneumatic turbines and control systems and to obtain environmental and structural loading data under real sea conditions.   The design and evaluation of a power take off train comprising pneumatic turbine, electrical generator and control system for subsequent manufacture and fitment to the collector and the construction and testing of the control system.   The project deliverables include: A prototype Wave Energy Collector with a peak pneumatic power capture rating of 2MW which can act as a test bed for turbo- generation and control equipment.   Control Hardware for testing on the Wave Energy Collector.   Field Measurements at full scale of the environmental loadings on a near-shore Wave Energy Collector over an annual cycle.  the energy capture efficiency of the collector in real sea states at full scale compared with predictions made from sinusoidal waves in tank model tests.   An assessment of the short term environmental impact of a near shore Wave Energy Collector.   A report on the operational experience of constructing and deploying a full scale Wave Energy Device.    Applied Research & Technology is a commercial development company established to exploit innovative ideas in the field of wave energy technology. The OSPREY (Ocean Swell Powered Renewable EnergY) project was conceived by Professor A. A. Wells as a result of his examination of the economic limitations of earlier wavepower devices. Concluding that a greater energy capture at lower capital cost was required to permit a widespread application of wave power a design of collector has been developed with a substantially improved performance but with a simpler and less expensive design. Manufacturing costs have been contained by concentrating the design on a lightweight steel shell structure which is readily constructed in the numerous steel fabrication yards available in Europe. In this respect the project offers a market for these extensive facilities which are currently under employed as a result of the run down in shipbuilding and oil related fabrications. Installation costs have been minimised by adopting a philosophy of minimal seabed preparation and by the use of gravity anchoring techniques reliant upon ballasting with locally available seabed material. To achieve an acceptable performance the design is a delicate balance of the requirements of energy capture, of structural integrity, of adequate ballast containment and of stability during towing and placement. Extensive model testing involving the measurement of energy capture, of structural loads and of the performance of various collector shapes during towage and flooding have highlighted a number of potential forms. These tank tests have been supported by detailed structural analyses by external engineering consultants to demonstrate the structural integrity of the device under extreme environmental conditions. These analyses have been taken to the point where they are limited by the accuracy of input data particularly in respect of storm wave loading. The next stage in the commercialisation of wave power is therefore to construct a full scale collector and deploy this in a convenient marine location where it can be readily observed and monitored. This will enable the theories and model tests results to be verified under realistic conditions. The current phase of the project is to construct and deploy the OWC collector on station at a site adjacent to Dounreay in Caithness, Scotland with the purpose of monitoring the pneumatic energy capture and structural performance. It is anticipated that electrical power generation equipment will be retrofitted during a subsequent phase of the project.",1,0
742,85734,No,Actinide reCycling by SEParation and Transmutation,"Actinide recycling by separation and transmutation is considered worldwide and particularly in several European countries as one of the most promising strategies to reduce the inventory of radioactive waste, thus contributing to make nuclear energy sustainable. Consistently with potentially viable recycling strategies, the Collaborative Project ACSEPT will provide a structured R&D framework to develop chemical separation processes compatible with fuel fabrication techniques, with a view to their future demonstration at the pilot level. Considering technically mature aqueous separation processes, ACSEPT will optimise and select the most promising ones dedicated to actinide partitioning and those featuring a group separation. These developments will be appropriately balanced with an exploratory research focused on the design of new molecules. In parallel, promising group actinide separation pyro-processes will be developed beyond the current state-of-the-art, as an alternative option, for a longer term. ACSEPT will also pave the way towards more integration between Partitioning and Transmutation by carrying dissolution as well as actinide conversion studies. All experimental results will be integrated by carrying out engineering and systems studies on aqueous and dry (pyro) processes to prepare for future demonstration at a pilot level. A training and education programme will also be implemented to share the knowledge among partitioning community and present and future generations of researchers. The challenging objectives of ACSEPT will be addressed by a multi-disciplinary consortium composed of European universities, nuclear research bodies and major industrial players. This consortium will generate fundamental improvements for a future design of an Advanced Processing Pilot Unit. ACSEPT will thus be an essential contribution to the demonstration, in the long term, of the potential benefits of actinide recycling to minimise the burden on the geological repositories.",1,0

300,218805,No,Development of Integrated MEasurement Systems,"The aim of the project is to develop advanced integrated testing methods that have the capability to detect a crack or delamination in a metallic or composite structure and have the potential to be deployed as part of an on-board structural health monitoring system for passenger aircraft. The proposal incorporates a new philosophy for monitoring damage in which the disturbance to the strain field in the structure caused by the damage is used to identify significant damage and to track its propagation. Recently, this approach has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in composite structures as traditional non-destructive evaluation techniques and, in CS2 project INSTRUCTIVE using infrared technology, it has been shown to be capable of identifying smaller cracks in metallic structures than any other available technique. In this project, it is proposed to amalgamate these innovations with more established techniques, such as strain gauges and acoustic emission, and to demonstrate an integrated testing method. The objectives are designed to mature technologies from TRL 4 to 6 that are likely to have a disruptive impact on the structural health monitoring of next generation large passenger aircraft The objectives are: i) to develop a robust and innovative concept for integrating a diverse set of sensors and data acquisition systems for detecting and monitoring damage in an aircraft assembly; ii) to produce an integrated system of sensors and data acquisition systems deployed on a test bench representing an aircraft assembly, and; iii) to conduct prototype demonstration and evaluation tests of the integrated system and test bench using independent systems. The primary outcome will be the demonstration, on a test bench consisting of an aircraft assembly, of an integrated measurement system for ‘on-line’ detecting and monitoring damage based on a diverse range of sensor systems.",0,0
182,6677,Yes,IMPROVED HYDROGEN STORAGE ALLOYS FOR CADMIUM-FREE HIGH PERFORMANCE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES UTILIZING CLOSED LOOP RECYCLING,"Hydrogen storing alloys were shown to offer a chance of further improvements. This is valid mainly for the high load performance. It was demonstrated that the use of new materials could improve the discharge rate capability by more than 50% compared to the standard materials currently being used. Though there still is a gap to the well established Ni/Cd-system the materials developed showed that NiMH-cells with improved materials can meet most of the power demands set by industrial applications today. The power capability of the new electrode materials was demonstrated with a new high power battery with high efficiency. Due to the high gravimetric and volumetric power values the hydride vehicle is the preferred application if this new battery.   Although it was demonstrated that a 60% reduction of the Co-content in the alloy can be realised by application of a new alloy formulation and the employment of an advanced production technology it is believed that a certain small amount of Co will be used also in the future. A first Co-free alloy seems to be on the horizon. However, it is envisaged that it will take some more time to improve capacity and rate capability of this material to a level appropriate for the new demand. Therefore the establishment of a recycling process if of vital interest if NiMH as a new battery system shall have a chance for becoming a wide spread product. The necessity to use a La enriched Mischmetal for producing the hydrogen storing alloy is also an argument for the high priority for establishing a recycling facility. Energy storage by Hydrogen absorption in metals and alloys is becoming increasingly important technology today. Electrochemical Hydrogen storage has been realized in the rechargeable Nickel/metal hydride (Ni/H) cells which are beginning to penetrate the market for portable and consumer appliances. Ni/H-batteries have 50% more energy density than comparable Nickel/Cadmium (Ni/Cd) batteries. But their use is as yet limited to low drain applications.  The high drain requirements of batteries for motive power or portable power tools cannot be satisfied by existing Ni/H technology. These markets are available to Ni/Cd batteries, but the use of these cells will become increasingly constrained by environmental factors. Automotive manufacturers have hesitated to use Ni/Cd batteries in traction applications because of lack of efficient and envrironmentally compatible recycling for this system.  The proposed research therefore is directed towards the development of new environmentally compatible materials to enable new, competitivly priced and high performance Ni/H cells to be developed to meet the growing needs of the market.  The major objectives of the R&D project will be :  1. Development of suitable, cost effective, and environmental compatible materials optimised for electrochemical Hydrogen-storage meeting the high performance requirements of power tools and electric vehicles.  2. Establishment of the technology for the production of the Hydrogen storage materials and big Ni/H-batteries on a commercial basis.  3. To assess the potential for an effective commercial recycling operation and to develop the basis for a closed loop recycling process.  A successful outcome of this project will facilitate the production of high performance, cost effective, and environmentally acceptable batteries which can be recycled in a closed loop environmentally safe process.  At the end of the project the full commercial development of the battery technology will require a further two years.",1,1

It is expected that these numbers will rise dramatically such that by 2020 more than 16 million new cases will be registered, with the number of deaths more than 10.3 million people per year worldwide (in Europe the number of deaths is estimated to rise to at least 2 million per year). In recent years improved early diagnosis and treatment options have contributed significantly to the battle against cancer. Nevertheless, there are still many major tumors that cannot be treated and one of the major approaches to overcome this problem is to develop new active anticancer drugs. In this project, a promising approach to new polynuclear Ru-arene metal complexes based on the sugar phosphite moiety is described. The approach combines the highly effective polynuclear concept, established for Pt-anticancer complexes, with a new mode of action and transport provided by ruthenium-arene compounds. The polynuclear Ru-system should endow the compounds with improved cytotoxicity and the sugar component should provide high tumor-affinity (selective uptake into the tumor via the transferrin pathway and via upregulation of the glucalitic activity).

The scientific activities include the development of new functionalisation strategies targeted at improving charge transfer in hybrids and therefore their photocatalytic activity, and in transferring these synergistic effects by assembling the hybrid units into macroscopic structures.  Three different types of hybrid architectures will be explored: Hybrid 1 – consisting of inorganic gyroids impregnated with the nanocarbon; Hybrid 2 – consisting of nanocarbon membranes coated with the inorganic compound by atomic layer deposition; Hybrid 3 - electrospun hybrid fibres.  CARINHYPH specifically aims to tailor interfacial charge and energy transfer processes by means of chemical functionalisation and evaluate them with photochemical and transient spectroscopy, as well as explore the effect of the nanocarbon as a substrate and heat sink, which stabilises smaller semiconductor particles and reduces agglomeration that will result in larger accessible surface areas.  Two industrial partners in the consortium, a nanocarbon supplier and a potential end user, guarantee that both ends of the production line are taken into account for the development of new technologies and the production of a roadmap for industrial deployment.

Computing resources are increasingly provided near the network edge, in a geographically distributed way, in the form of so-called fog nodes. Data produced in end devices like smartphones, sensors or IoT devices can be stored, processed and analysed across a continuum of compute resources, from end devices via fog nodes to cloud services. This decentralized computing paradigm provides huge benefits in terms of reduced latency, increased processing speed and energy savings, but the protection of sensitive data in such a widely decentralized setting becomes a critical concern. FogProtect delivers new and advanced architectures, technologies, and methodologies for ensuring end-to-end data protection across the computing continuum, from cloud data centres through fog nodes to end devices.

To achieve this control resonant cavities for the simultaneous localization of elastic and electromagnetic waves will bedeveloped. The mentioned structures will be based on artificial anisotropic and inhomogeneous materials, designed by properly engineered periodic arrangements of scattering units. The project aims to exploit the unusual properties of these complex structures for the localization of the energy carried out by mechanical and electromagnetic waves, offering in this way a new insight to the field of artificial materials (metamaterials), where less attention has been given to the problem of localization of waves, since it has focused efforts in the extraordinary propagation characteristics of waves along them (negative refraction, cloaking, transformation acoustics and electromagnetics, etc.). The objectives of the project will be accomplished by the deep understanding of a new type of structures: Radial Wave Crystals (RWC), a special type of sonic and photonic crystals which present cylindrical or spherical symmetries. It is well known that cylindrical shells of RWC present extraordinary resonant properties. However, their study has been slow given the difficulties found in their physical realization. In this proposal this feasibility will be explored, and also less restrictive versions of RWC will be seek, but trying to keep their extraordinary properties. Finally, based on RWC a new type of optomechanical cavities will be investigated, by studying the electromagnetic and mechanical properties of these structures embedded in finite substrates.

369,106614,No,Advanced Measurement and Control of Exciton Diffusion for Next Generation Organic Semiconductor Optoelectronics,"There is great interest in organic materials with semiconducting electronic properties.  This arises from both a scientific point of view (how can a plastic be a semiconductor?) and a technological point of view as these materials can be used to make light-emitting diodes, lasers and solar cells.  The performance of all these devices is strongly affected by exciton diffusion, a process that is little studied or understood (particularly compared with charge transport) largely because of the lack of reliable measurement techniques.  The purpose of this proposal is to make a breakthrough in the measurement, understanding and control of exciton diffusion in organic semiconductors, and so create a new generation of materials and devices with enhanced performance due to control of exciton diffusion.  The key elements of the study are first to develop and validate advanced measurements of exciton diffusion.  This will open up the whole topic of exciton “transport” and provide the tools for us (and others) to explore the physics of exciton diffusion and how it is affected by a range of factors relating to the structure of the materials and how they are processed.  The following phase of work will use information about the main factors affecting exciton diffusion to develop strategies for controlling it.  A particular challenge is to increase exciton diffusion which will then lead to improved efficiency of organic solar cells.  We aim to address this both by applying the structure-property relations we develop and by developing directional exciton transfer, including quantum coherent energy transfer.  This is an unconventional approach to improving organic solar cells, which could not only improve their efficiency, but also greatly simplify their structure, leading to a breakthrough in their manufacturability. Control of exciton diffusion arising from the proposed research will also lead to strategies for increasing the efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes and lasers.",0,0

T rays sources must be obtained at the limits of electronics from one side and optical systems from the other, resulting in a lack of efficient and practical radiation sources.

The simplicity of the tech-nological process used for the fabrication of these diodes is remarkable, since it only involves the etching of insulating trenches or recess lines on a semiconductor surface (a single step of high reso-lution lithography).

Specific objectives consists mainly for each country in:  * measuring the potential impact of the GATT/TRIPS agreements on the local pharmaceutical industrial sector and drugs availability, prices and affordability,  * observing the dynamics induced by these international agreements and the project of creating a free trade zone in the Mediterranean countries,  * outlining different scenarios of the possible evolution of the pharmaceutical sector after complete implementation of these agreements,  * proposing measures to develop new partnerships in the pharmaceutical field between the European Union and North African countries (Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia). Expected Outcome  The project aims, in general, at :   * strengthening the capacity of researchers and decision-makers to conduct multi-disciplinary research on an issue at the cross-roads of public health, pharmaceutical industry and financial policy.  * proposing possible alternatives and, if possible, selecting out the solutions that have given the best results.  Three sets of reports will come out of this research :   First phase: reports by country to assess the performances of the pharmaceutical sector.  * Reports of countries of the South : the reports will make it possible to measure in each country of the South, the capacity of the pharmaceutical sector to meet the population's basic needs in drugs on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to take up challenges brought about by an altered international and regional context.  * Reports of countries of the North (France, Italy, Spain) are aimed at assessing the ongoing dynamics concerning relations between Italy, France and Spain (the major European trade partners of North Africa) and countries of the South selected by the survey : what is the situation in the following areas : government and trade accords, exports, cooperation, technology transfer, trade and industrial strategies, financial flows ...  Second phase: the impact of GATT/TRIPS on the pharmaceutical sector and of accords with the European Union  Reports on each country will have to answer the following questions :  * What are the efforts already recorded of the Marrakech agreements or of the negotiations with the European Union on the production, trade, prices, range and technology related issues? After completion of the preliminary phase (definition of research tools and methods, inventory of regional and international experiences and analysis of the international literature), the research will consist of 3 main phases, followed by a final phase (writing of the final report) :  1st phase (September, 1997 - June, 1998) : Assessment of the situation concerning pharmaceutical channels in each country. How does the pharmaceutical sector organize itself and how does it answer to needs? To what degree does it fit into the regional and international context?  2nd phase (July, 1998 - April, 1999) : what is the impact of the Marrakech agreements? What perceptions do the different actors have of the strategies elaborated and current policies?  3rd phase (April, 1999 - May, 2000) : hypotheses, change scenarios, and proposals towards a new partnership between Southern and Northern Mediterranean countries.  Four coordination seminars will be held. The research problems will be elaborated in common, the research tools and methods will be defined and the work carried out, presented and discussed. Each Southern Team will be responsible for the research in its own country; the Northern Teams will study the factors originating in their countries that influence the countries in the South. In each country in the South, a steering committee bringing together managers, industrialists and researchers, will facilitate and support the research.",0,0

138,211954,Yes,Democratizing energy markets through the introduction of innovative flexibility-based demand response tools and novel business and market models for energy cooperatives,"FLEXCoop introduces an end-to-end Automated Demand Response Optimization Framework. It enables the realization of novel business models, allowing energy cooperatives to introduce themselves in energy markets under the role of an aggregator.  It equips cooperatives with innovative and highly effective tools for the establishment of robust business practices to exploit their microgrids and dynamic VPPs as balancing and ancillary assets toward grid stability and alleviation of network constraints. Optimization in FLEXCoop applies to multiple levels. It spans local generation output, demand and storage flexibility, as well as the flexibility offered by EVs to facilitate maximum RES integration into the grid, avoidance of curtailment and satisfaction of balancing and ancillary grid needs. This is achieved via automated, human-centric demand response schemes with the participation of appropriately selected residential prosumers. To enhance prosumer acceptance, the FLEXCoop innovative services will feature non-intrusiveness, comfort and well-being preservation, non-violation of prosumer daily schedules as well as maximization of benefits through transparent and open participation in markets. It will also guarantee easy switching between DR service providers, vendor lock-in avoidance, customized DR service contracts and objective settlement and remuneration, thus establishing an energy democracy context and empowering prosumers to become active energy market players. FLEXCoop brings together a wide range of baseline technologies to build an open and interoperable DR optimization framework, including a fully-fledged tool suite for energy cooperatives (aggregators) and prosumers involved in the DR value chain, ensuring: (i) DR stakeholders empowerment and transformation into active market players, (ii) end-to-end interoperability between energy networks, energy management systems and devices  and (iii) the realization of new business models for energy cooperatives.",0,1
598,206195,No,Ultra-Low Power Event-Based Camera,"The long term goal of ULPEC is to develop advanced vision applications with ultra-low power requirements and ultra-low latency.  The output of the ULPEC project is a demonstrator connecting a neuromorphic event-based camera to a high speed ultra-low power consumption asynchronous visual data processing system (Spiking Neural Network with memristive synapses). Although ULPEC device aims to reach TRL 4, it is a highly application-oriented project:  prospective use cases will be studied and an application roadmap will be developed, by considering interoperability for an integration in “systems of systems” as well as the definition of upper power consumption limits depending on future application. The project consortium therefore includes an industrial end-user (Bosch), which will more particularly investigate autonomous and computer assisted driving. Autonomous and computer assisted driving are indeed a major disruption in the transport and car manufacturing sector. Vision and recognition of traffic event must be computed with very low latency (to improve security) and low power (to accommodate the power limited environment in a car, such as power budget and heat dissipation). Substantial impact on innovation capacity and creation of market opportunities is expected under the ULPEC project: four enterprises (two SMEs) participate to the project. The ULPEC project is an opportunity for European companies such as TSST to increase the competitiveness and increase the global market share in manufacturing tools for complex oxide thin film synthesis. Besides, a compact, low-power vision system based on the technology intended to be developed in this project would generate a distinct competitive advantage over conventional solutions and would clearly boost Chronocam’s market potential. ULPEC is also an opportunity for SMEs to develop stronger collaboration with the industrial leaders involved in the project, such as IBM and Bosch.",0,0
491,84218,No,Attosecond observation and control of collective electron dynamics in nanoparticles,"The generation and characterization of attosecond laser pulses has been significantly advanced in recent years and two major tools are now at hand that can be used to explore ultrafast physics.  The first is the ability to control electronic motion via waveform controlled laser fields. The second is the availability of single attosecond pulses that can be used to probe electronic motion in real-time. We want to use these tools to study collective electronic dynamics, which are of particular importance for the optical response of nanoparticles. These materials are of huge fundamental interest and have wide applications ranging from markers in medicine and biology over catalysts in chemistry to quantum computers.  The motivation for studies on nanoparticles is r elated to the possibility of tailoring their dynamical behaviour on the basis of size and shape. For the first time, we will explore electron dynamics in nanoparticles with sub-femtosecond time resolution. This way, we can gain information on the collective electronic properties of these materials on the timescale on which they occur in nature. Our work can have a huge impact on the development of nanoplasmonic devices.  The proposed project will help the applicant to successfully reintegrate into academics and form the basis for his career as an independent scientist and group leader in attosecond science. The proposal will also contribute to keeping European research at the forefront in this quickly evolving scientific field.",0,0
728,203179,No,Light-Responsive Adhesives for Debond-on-Demand Solutions,"Adhesives that debond-on-demand through application of an external stimulus are highly relevant for manufacturing (semiconductor, automotive, aerospace, construction, packaging, sportswear), healthcare applications (wound dressing, transdermal patches), and numerous other domains, and they can significantly contribute to the sustainable use of materials (repairing, reworking, recycling). In all cases, there is a technological need for effective and environmentally benign solutions that provide secure adhesion during use, while also permitting for a simple and clean separation of bonded parts “on command” without the need for additional complex process steps.  The proposed project aims to develop new debond-on-demand adhesives based on the combination of low-molecular weight functional polymers and light-responsive degradable cross-linking agents. The new materials are expected to combine optimal adhesive properties for a wide range of substrates with a new mechanism that enables straightforward and efficient, ultraviolet light-induced debonding at ambient temperature. The debonding mechanism involves two different effects that are combined in a synergistic manner: the controlled degradation of the cross-linker transforms polymer networks into low-molecular weight polymers, and the simultaneous release of nitrogen gas “propels” the bonded parts away from each other. The degraded polymer residues can be easily removed and clean debonded components are furnished. The overarching goals of the proposed project are to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and implementation by (i) providing a better understanding for the mechanism at play; (ii) demonstrating the effect in a variety of adhesive platforms based on polymers that are employed in current adhesive technologies; and (iii) providing technology demonstrators for pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes and cold-cured two-component adhesives with debond-on-demand properties.",0,0

1018,186227,No,Functional and molecular characterization of excitatory layer IV neurons in mouse visual cortex,"What developmental processes are responsible for establishing the sensory preference of cortical neurons? In visual cortex, neurons belonging to a particular class (e.g. morphologically similar neurons in layer IV) are diverse in their functional properties, including receptive field size, and spatial and temporal frequency preference. For each neuron, these response properties are primarily defined by the pattern of inputs it receives. On one hand, these inputs could be selected by stochastic or activity-dependent processes during development. On the other hand, the pattern of inputs may be guided by molecular factors that ultimately determine functionally distinct neuronal subtypes. In other words, an apparently homogeneous cell type may in fact comprise several functionally distinct subclasses established by their patterns of gene expression.  Specifically, we will test (i) whether a morphologically homogeneous population of excitatory neurons is diverse at the level of their individual transcriptional profiles, (ii) whether any transcriptional differences between individual neurons are related to their visual response properties, and (iii) whether their molecular identities persist in the absence of structured visual input. To this end, we will extract the mRNAs and determine the transcriptional profile of individual neurons whose visual response properties have been characterised in vivo, using methods developed in the host lab. Together, this proposal will attempt identify the contribution of molecular determinants to shaping connectivity and response properties of cortical excitatory neurons.",0,0
968,34241,No,Waste water recycling supplied by renewable energies in the near east,"The main objectives are as follows: * To identify the potential for the employment of renewable energies for waste water treatment. * To work out the technical problems of purification plants supplied with renewable energies depending on: the waste water amount and pollution, the demand of water for reuse, the present state in energy supply, the potential of the renewable energies (especially solar and wind energy). This includes the design of an optimal energy management for these systems. * To determine the environmental and socio-economic impacts resulting from waste water treatment including water reuse and a power supply with renewable energies. With a cost benefit analysis it will be possible to compare the external costs of conventional systems and the systems proposed in this project. * To analyse these objectives in detail for the Near East region and to give criteria for the transfer of the proposed systems to the West Mediterranean region where similar problems exist. Expected Outcome  The essential result of this project will be the criteria for the installation of purification plants supplied by renewable energies. With these criteria it should be possible to decide which are the optimal conditions for an installation of these systems taking into consideration : the situation on waste water amount and pollution, the water demand for irrigation, the energy supply and the potential of renewable energies. The results are of direct use in the Near East region but also a concept will be made on how to use the results in the West Mediterranean region. The key activities envisaged are: * Analysis of the amount and pollution of waste water, the existing situation in waste water treatment and the demand of water for drinking and irrigation including the future development. * Analysis of the present state in energy supply for municipal and rural areas including future plans and determination of the potential of solar and wind energy. * Work out of purification methods taking into consideration the waste water amount and pollution and the water demand for irrigation. * Adaptation of these purification plants to the renewable energy supply. * Determination of sites where these purification plants are feasible. * Consideration of environmental and socio-economic impacts and cost benefit analysis for purification plants supplied by renewable energies. * Work out of criteria for the installation of purification plants in the Near East. * Concepts for consultation of local and national authorities and for the transfer to the West Mediterranean countries.",1,0
1012,221871,No,Understanding and leveraging ‘moments of change’ for pro-environmental behaviour shifts,"Responding to climate change requires profound changes to individual behaviour. However, much of our behaviour is habitual, which is resistant to change. Habits are cued by stable contexts (i.e., same time, place and/or social group), so when these change, habits are disrupted, providing an opportunity to intervene to foster pro-environmental behaviour. ‘Moments of change’ are when individual life circumstances shift within a short time frame, and include biographical and exogenous changes (e.g., becoming a parent, travel disruption). The relationship between moments of change and environmental impact is complex, with heterogeneity between individuals, cultures and behaviours. The aim of this proposal is to examine how ambitious lifestyle change might be achieved through understanding and harnessing ‘moments of change’ in life circumstances. This project integrates insights from several fields (developmental and environmental psychology, sociology, science & technology studies) to bring a much-needed focus on the temporal and socio-technical dimensions of pro-environmental behaviour (change). There are two objectives for the research: (a) To explore and track moments of pro-environmental behaviour change across cultures and life-course; and (b) To examine the efficacy of behavioural interventions targeted to moments of change. Three work packages address these objectives through an ambitious programme of cross-cultural research using secondary and big data analyses, longitudinal qualitative interviews and panel surveys to explore moments of change, and experimental studies to test behaviour change interventions targeted at moments of change (e.g., starting university, retiring, relocating). This project promises a step-change in understanding the dynamics of pro-environmental change across the life course and cultures, and the development of robust habit-disrupting interventions to foster lifestyle change.",0,0
669,213833,No,Mechanical and systemic control of growth during Drosophila abdominal development,"Control of tissue size during animal development is of crucial importance to achieve the correct body/organ size and shape, and it underpins the evolution of animal size and architecture. How is tissue size tightly controlled during development? How is each cell in a developing animal instructed to stop growing and dividing when the correct body size and shape has been reached? Answers to these questions are of fundamental importance to our understanding of diseases such as cancer as well as for regenerative medicine. Using the development of the Drosophila abdominal epidermis as a model, we will perform long-term quantitative in vivo analysis of cellular behaviours and generate fluorescent live reporters of growth-promoting pathways to correlate activity patterns with developmentally regulated growth phases. We will manipulate tissue mechanics as well as nutrient-sensing pathways to understand how nutrient availability and tissue-intrinsic physical properties are integrated to specify final tissue size. In combination with computational modelling, we aim to generate a better understanding of developmental growth, as well as the mechanisms that trigger tissue growth arrest. The mechanisms regulating how cell proliferation is triggered in response to extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli and the transitions between different proliferative/growth states, particularly in tumour cells or regenerative tissues, are poorly understood. As these events are precisely defined in Drosophila abdominal morphogenesis, we hope to uncover the internal logic modulating cell cycle/growth rates transitions that can be used as a genetically tractable paradigm for the study of equivalent processes in cancer, regeneration or development.",0,0
