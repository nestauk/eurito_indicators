# Testing on the browser

This directory contains code created for determining layout breakpoints
across display devices and configurations.

Though the code is not well organized nor easy to read, it may eventually serve 
as the basis for running more tests directly in the browser through
Browserstack using Selenium and/or Cypress.

It will need some heavy refactoring however before it's ready for that however.
